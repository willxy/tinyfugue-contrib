    One of the great TF newbie-helpers was Andrew "Andy" Mortimer. While he
    disappeared off the web, I was able archive much of his
    publicly-accessable work. Presented below is a collection of files and
    macros he wrote.
```

 - [`autolog.tf`](autolog.tf)
 - [`eattr.tf`](eattr.tf)
 - [`info.tf`](info.tf)
 - [`local.tf`](local.tf)
 - [`pairlist.tf`](pairlist.tf)
 - [`ping.tf`](ping.tf)
 - [`places.tf`](places.tf)
 - [`sepchat.tf`](sepchat.tf)
 - [`time.tf`](time.tf)
 - [`tmcat.tf`](tmcat.tf)
 - [`usrflag.tf`](usrflag.tf)
 - [`vieworld.tf`](vieworld.tf)

Also:

 - [`tiny.tf`](tiny.tf)

```
    The tiny.tf file shows special configuration options either limited to
    (or at least most useful in) a TinyMUSH environment.
```

 - [`sample_tfrc.tf`](sample_tfrc.tf)

```
    Andy's sample tfrc.tf shows some of the wide variety of options you can
    configure.
```

 - [`tf-intro-1_0a1.html`](tf-intro-1_0a1.html)

```
    Andy wrote a "Beginner's Guide to Tinyfugue" which explains the basics
    of configuring a '.tfrc' file and writing simple macros. You can take a 
    look at the web version if you like.
