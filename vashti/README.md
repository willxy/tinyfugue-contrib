    tinyfugue is unquestionably the most powerful MUD client available
    under Linux, and probably on any platform. It's also hairy enough to
    send grown men screaming into the night at the thought of having to use
    it - so, of course, I had to learn more about it.

    On this page I'll put some of the macro packages I've put together.
    Many are Discworld specific, but some are not. Some of them may work
    with tf versions older than 5.0, but I wouldn't want to bet on it. Most
    contain documentation within them, so be sure to have a look at it.

    Thanks to Shinobi@Discworld who got me started with tf.
```

 - [`auto_show.tf`](auto_show.tf)

```
    This package simplifies the process of responding to show requests.
```

 - [`autolog.tf`](autolog.tf)

```
    This will create a logfile automatically every time you log in. It logs
    commands and remote output, but not tf's local output (help pages and
    so on). It also needs configuring, so be sure to read it for
    documentation.
```

 - [`average_xp.tf`](average_xp.tf)

```
    This monitors the amount of xp you make in five minutes, then prints a
    report and extrapolates to tell you how much xp you would have made at
    the end of the hour, if you continued making xp at the same rate.
```

 - [`monitor_count.tf`](monitor_count.tf)

```
    This modifies score brief and the combat monitor to include the
    difference between the last instance and the current one - so by how
    much your hp, gp and xp have changed since then. Useful.
```

 - [`monitor_teach.tf`](monitor_teach.tf)

```
    This tracks your xp and teaching and tells you when you have amassed
    enough xp to learn the skill you last failed to learn.
```

 - [`persistent_variables.tf`](persistent_variables.tf)

```
    This lets you save certain variables to a dotfile and restore them from
    .tfrc or similar. Note that later tf5 betas have similar functionality
    built in, but some of the packages on this page still use this.
```

 - [`talker_one_convert.tf`](talker_one_convert.tf)

```
    This makes talker channel one appear the same as the rest of the talker
    channels - that is, with "(One)" at the start. Inspired by TGGM.
```
