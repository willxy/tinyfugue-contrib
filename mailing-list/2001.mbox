I dunno if this will do it any better, basically all I've done is to put a
/SET reroll=0 in there (I cleaned it up so I could read it better  :)
Oh, and sorry for the long 1st line

/DEF -mregexp  -t'(Strength|Reflex|Agility|Charisma|Discipline|Wisdom|Stamina|Intelligence)=[^10]' set_touch = \
	/SET reroll=1%;
	/IF (reroll=1) /THEN /do_reroll%;

Hi.

This question may sound rather basic, but I have looked through the
information available about the client and have failed to find a solution to
my problem.

The problem is that I don't know how to scroll up and down in TinyFugue. The
MOO I play on (Harpers-Tale) involves a lot of descriptive text, and without
scrolling it makes it impossible to play it.

Please, if anyone can help, can they do so.

Edge.

Try turning more paging on, with /more on. TF will pause between
screenfuls, requesting you press the TAB key to continue to the next page.

If you want to recall lines you missed (or want to re-read), see
/help recall.

As a quick guide, /recall 50 will recall the last 50 lines, /recall 1-10
would recall the first ten lines, and so on. You can apply regexps and all
sorts of wizardry to it, apparently, but I don't, so you'd have to read
the docs for it.

HTH,

Mo.

I am about to give up on this one, but not yet, how would i have it so
that say, if everything does equal to 10, it sets reroll to 1, and so long
as reroll is not 1, it sends the reroll command only once into the game? i
have tried and am very very unsuccessful thus far..thanks--gabe

Hmm, well, try this, I added one line in, if reroll does not equal 1, then
it should break out of the macro.  Or you can change it to if (reroll=0),
if you are sure that its only gonna be 1 or 0.  Hope this helps ya out

This won't work. You can't test the reroll immediately... you have to set up
ANOTHER match that looks for the PROMPT that is displayed after you see the
roll results. ONLY THEN can you test the variable.

Right.  An important piece of information that was in the original mail that
has been omitted from the followups is that the result of the roll comes back
in 3 lines, not 1.  So the trigger above might match all 3 lines, and so
would reroll 3 times.  You have have each trigger set the reroll flag (or not),
and then test it exactly once, after all the result lines have been seen.

If the result is spread across 3 lines because you have line wrapping enabled
on the server, I recommend you disable it.  Having results on 1 line will
make this and other triggers much easier.

If you can't get the server to send the result in one line, you need to make
a trigger or hook that matches only once, after all the lines have arrived.
One way to do this is with a PROMPT hook (if your server sends prompts).
Another way is to make the test trigger fall-through (with -F), and make
another lower-priority trigger that only matches the last line of the result;
the second trigger does a reroll if the flag is set.

The next example uses the last method, assuming that 'Intelligence'
appears only on the last result line.  It also splits the first trigger up
into one trigger for each stat, so you can have a different minimum for
each.

/def -Fp3 -mregexp -t'Strength=([0-9]*)' minimum_strength = \
    /if ({P1} < 13) /set reroll=1%; /endif
/def -Fp3 -mregexp -t'Reflex=([0-9]*)' minimum_reflex = \
    /if ({P1} < 10) /set reroll=1%; /endif
...
/def -Fp3 -mregexp -t'Intelligence=([0-9]*)' minimum_intelligence = \
    /if ({P1} < 11) /set reroll=1%; /endif

/def -p1 -mregexp -t'Intelligence=([0-9]*)' test_reroll = \
    /if (reroll) /do_reroll%; /endif

/def do_reroll = \
    /set reroll=0%;
    /send reroll

heya, 

i was wondering if this is going to be a part of the TF sometimes in the future
the docs and stuff are at http://www.abandoned.org/nemon/compress/index.html
I've added it to our mud about week ago and about half of the ppl is using it
already, i heard that zuggsoft promised that it would be in the new zmud
whenever that will be. but i would rather stick with TF for ever ;)

					thanks,
                                                Dingo.

Hi,

I play a mud, and have been looking for a mud client, with triggers and so

nice to meet you all!

I'll think about it.  But I don't really see much point.  Mud traffic just
doesn't use that much bandwidth.  Also, many mud servers are already CPU bound;
if the server had to compress every connection, this additional load might
cause a noticable _increase_ in response time.  (I don't have any hard data
for this; if anyone does, speak up.)

I agree with Ken.  This looks like a solution in search of a problem.

Um. You could allow world connections to be proxied thru an external
program who's stdin and stdout would be used for the connection. This
would allow some of us to use ssh or something to connect to the mud
as well. Anyway, if that were possible - then you could do
'compressdecompress | nc mud.net 12345'.

One current solution is nowadays to say:
nc -l 13131 | compressdecompress | nc mud.name 23

and define the world in TF as 'localhost:13131'.

I just took a closer look at the protocol itself, and found it's actually
broken, regardless of anyone's opinion of whether or not it's worthwhile.
I Cc:'d Oliver Jowett on this, so maybe he can do something about it.

The MCCP command to begin compression is IAC SB COMPRESS WILL SE.  But
according to RFC 854, the SE should not have any special meaning unless it
follows an IAC.  This is because some subnegotiations (like NAWS, RFC
1073) can contain aribrary binary data; if bare SE were allowed to end a
subnegotiation, it would be indistinguishable from a 240 in the data.  The
only special octet in a subnegotiation is IAC.  This also allows the
reading code to just collect up everything between IAC SB and IAC SE
without having to understand it (except for converting IAC IAC to IAC),
and then pass the collected string to some other subroutine to parse it.
This may not be a big deal to clients that don't do any other telnet
negotiation, but TinyFugue does, and I don't want to complicate the code
to handle this non-compliant case.

I see no way to salvage the protocol that would satisfy the standard while
maintaining compatability with existing (nonstandard) clients, except to
define a new option (say, COMPRESS2, with the value 86).  The COMPRESS2
protocol would be identical to the COMPRESS protocol, except the command
to start compression would be IAC SB COMPRESS2 IAC SE.  New/upgraded
servers should try IAC WILL COMPRESS2 first; if the client refuses that,
the server can then try IAC WILL COMPRESS, so it will still work with
existing clients.  TinyFugue would only support COMPRESS2, so would only
be able to do compression with new/upgraded servers.

Perhaps: send IAC SB COMPRESS WILL SE IAC SE. Hopefully, older clients
that use my (broken) code rather than their own telnet implementation will
extract the IAC SB COMPRESS WILL SE and ignore as garbage the trailing IAC
SE.

Trying COMPRESS2 and falling back to COMPRESS would work if existing
clients reliably responded to option negotiation. They don't :(

Trying COMPRESS and falling back to COMPRESS2 would probably work better,
since clients aware of the existance of COMPRESS2 can be counted on to
refuse COMPRESS reliably.

If implementing COMPRESS2 seems the better option: what else should I
change at the same time? It's been quite a while since I threw the
protocol together, it could probably do with a redesign...

I don't have any hard data either, but it's having no noticable effect on
a small server (30-ish players). It could well have an effect on larger
servers, but I'd be suprised if it was large (there isn't really much data
to compress).  What's the typical peak output bandwidth of a busy
CPU-bound server? A horribly inaccurate benchmark is that my system here
(a p2-266) appears to compress at about 750-1000k/s at gzip level 6 for
compressible data. 

It does noticably speed up client connections though; I'd guess that a
large part of that is that virtually everything sent by the server will be
below the path MTU so the effect of packet loss is a lot lower (and
perhaps it avoids some effect of traffic bursts on packet loss).  If
you're generating a lot of output it comes down noticably faster on slow
links even when there's no packet loss involved.

Is the tf list archived somewhere? I'm missing the rest of this thread.

(cc's appreciated)

That fits with RFC 854, but wouldn't old clients consider the trailing
IAC SE to be the first two octets of compressed data, and pass it to
inflate(), which would think it's corrupted data and fail?

How about this:  the server sends the new command followed by the old
command.  I.e.,  IAC SB COMPRESS IAC SE  IAC SB COMPRESS WILL SE.  Old
clients will treat the first 5 octets as garbage, then see the old
command and start decompressing immediately.  New clients will see the
new command and obey that; we'll define the new command to mean "ignore
the next 5 bytes, then start decompressing."

Hmm, ok.

There's one issue that I think is already handled ok, but the specification
wasn't clear on it and I didn't read your code that carefully:  option
negotiation should be allowed inside the compressed stream.  Implementing
this just means the MCCP code should not do anything special with IAC in
the stream, and the client should interpret IAC the same way whether it
came from a plain stream or a compressed stream.

If you're really concerned about compressing the traffic and don't care
if the
user have to have special software (and that's the direction you're
moving),
put a database of messages in the users client and then just send the id
of
the message...

No, I'm not very serious.

Why not just give the players a copy of the whole server, that should make it

This requires each and every MUD to agree on a format for how they
want messages to be stored..  but I'm not sure the battle spam is the
most taxing.. what about all the conversation and room descriptions?
Changing gear etc?  You can't even hope to assign every message on the
mud a number.. 

Also, you would need a reliable way of informing the client which mud
it was.. or do you want to leave that to the user/protocol
negotiation?

Nevermind, this doesn't work.  When a new client connected to an old server
sees IAC SB COMPRESS WILL SE, it will wait indefinitely for the IAC SE
which will never come.  (That's what I get for trying to be clever at 5am.)
The only fix is to use COMPRESS2.

You can do this with the /repeat command fairly easily; if you meant  
"with random intervals" you can still do it, but not quite as easily. 
I think. :)

   Sure.. Use repeat.. For example:

/repeat -0:03:00 1440 /my_macro

  This would call my_macro every three minutes. I have set the
number of times to a 1440 which would make it stop repeating after
about 3 days (more than enough for me), but there's no stopping
setting it higher..

So in short..

/repeat -delaytime(hh:mm:ss) numberoftimes do_what

Hope this helps you.. Feel free to ask follow-up questions..

THanks for everyone who helped me. I have one more question I know you
can use the Disconnect hook to make a relogon trigger if you are
disconnected here is my dilemma...if i was to use the DISCONNECT to call
a repeating loop to try and log on again...and say i was successful
logging in on the first try but i have the logon loop to repeat say 20
times...is there anyway i can terminate that repeat so that it doesnt
continously try to relog on if it is successful?

Umm... perhaps you should have read his entire email... he added, at the
bottom, this line:

>No, I'm not very serious.

Now, I don't know about you, but that says to me that he's joking. As in, he
isn't serious. As in, you don't have to pick apart the stupidity of the idea
because he (and likely everyone else) already KNOWS that it's a silly idea.

try

/hook DISCONNECT = /repeat -10 1 /world whatever
/hook CONFAIL = /repeat -10 1 /world whatever

or just

/hook DISCONNECT = /retry whatever 10

if you want to do random intervals you can do something like:

/def random_interval = \
  /do_something_here%; \
  /eval /repeat -$[rand(__max_interval_goes_here__)] 1 /random_interval

not tested.

Some guy a year ago or something send me a programme (in c) that compiled
and so on allowed tf to generate repeats with 0.01 second delays. It was
very useful thing. Does anyone have that programme or know how to organize
it under tf (nods, I know it'll be built in tf 5.0 package)? 0.1 second
delays could be.

This has been bugging me for a few months now and I can't find
a solution.

I use control-p to go through my tf history. Every once in a 
while I miss the 'p' a bit to the right and press
control-o. This seems to suspend input (but not output) into
TF. control-c still works, but no other keys do. My only solution
is to control-c and then exit tf and restart.

What does control-o do?
Can I disable control-o, or restore my tf session to it's original state?


I am running:
% TinyFugue version 4.0 stable 1.
% Copyright (C) 1993 - 1999 Ken Keys (hawkeye@tcp.com).
% Built for SunOS Generic_106541-04 5.7

Inside of Screen version 3.09.04.
All of this inside an xterm.

I load:
/load worldqueue.tf

And for various triggers I require:
tools.tf

I also have defined:
/visual on
/more on

and a bunch of personal triggers. (none of which appear to mess
with control-o).

Thanks,
John

I fear this is more a Solaris thing than a TF thing. I think it can be
solved
by some creative setup of your tty, but I cannot remember exactly how.

I have a small problem with a regional characters - f.e. polish
characters. I am using tf 40 stable1 and have NO troubles with it
using tf on any SunOS but i am missing it on linux.
And there is another problem - my linux supports polish characters
( at display and keyboard), and on SunOs i can't use them typping, but
have no problems with reading. 

Anyone has any idea why ?

It's definitely a Solaris problem; I'm sure Ken Keys can be more specific as to
its function and the bug therein.

Stick this in your config file (.profile, .bashrc, .cshrc, etc):

# disable first three; enable ixany
stty lnext '^@' flush '^@' start '^@' ixany

^O is "flush"; "start" is ^Q (the antidote to ^S).  Turning on ixany will
effectively cancel the effects of ^S - something else I hit often (so I
end up banging on ^Q a lot when I hit bad lag).  Can't remember what lnext
is but turning it off seemed to help also.

'man stty' contains more info and wisdom that I do not know.

It's difficult to say based on the information you give above.  I use tf
4.0 under Linux, and locale support (regional characters) works fine for
me: all I have to do is set my locale to one that supports the characters
I want to use (/set LC_ALL en_US, or in your case, /set LC_ALL pl_PL), and
all of the characters show up correctly.

Learn Why Over 90% Who Try to Make Money 
on the Internet FAIL and exactly how 
an elite 2% ARE POCKETING OUTRAGEOUS PROFITS!

People like yourself are now making as much as $200
a day by spending as little as 2 hours a day working
on the Internet.

Dear Entrepreneur...

In the next couple of minutes I'd like to discuss 
some ideas with you. If you have ever thought about 
running your own business or you already have a business, 
you will find the following information quite relevant.

Frankly, running your own business can be enormously 
challenging. There never seems to be enough time or 
money to get everything done that you've planned. With 
many businesses the more successful you get the LESS 
TIME you have to enjoy your family, your profits...
your life. It's a sad "catch 22" that can exhaust 
many business owners and entrepreneurs. 

Allow me introduce myself... I'm Dave London. I was a 
County employee working in the field of corrections 
some years ago and before long I became frustrated 
with the utter sameness of the work and the paycheck. 
Pay raises were not based on merit but on budgeting 
concerns....at any rate, they were few and far between. 
I knew I had no real future working for someone else. 

After several years I got burned out, fed up and I finally 
just quit. I believed at the time that my best avenue 
to financial independence, actual WEALTH, was by writing 
a proprietary information product...also known in the 
good old days as a book. 

My first little booklet, called GO FOR IT!, sold 5000 copies 
at $12 each within about 90 days. Then, I spent the next 
summer writing Mind Over Money and sold about 10,000 
copies that Fall also for $12 each....plus another 
25,000 copies over the next couple of years. Over 
$400,000 in two years! 

Not too bad, just starting out. 

Only problem was, I was working in my business (not on it). 
My wife and I often were up to 11 or 12 PM entering orders 
(up to 500 a day!) into our database, printing labels, 
packing up books, shipping and responding to inquiries etc. 

Plus, I had to develop future ad campaigns, write the 
sales letters, pick the mailing lists, shop for the best 
printers etc. etc.. And...when sales of Mind Over Money 
started to taper off I had to find another product or 
write another book. Whew!!! Makes me tired just thinking 
about it! 

Today, I still write books because that's what I enjoy 
doing. And, I still write ad copy because I like to do 
that as well. But, I've automated every other aspect 
of my business using the Internet and amazing new 
software. Now, I can actually promote my products 
in a couple of hours a day (actually, I have a Student 
Intern do all the work!

A Home Business That Practically RUNS ITSELF...

My online systems not only respond with advertising 
copy to all inquiries, automatically, but also take 
the orders and even send out the product...even while 
I'm sleeping.

I NEVER DREAMED I COULD MAKE SO MUCH MONEY 
SO EASILY...

In fact, based on my original experience as a fledging 
entrepreneur and writer I expected I would have to be 
working harder than ever.

I WANT TO OFFER YOU A WAY TO MAKE THE MONEY 
AND LIVE THE LIFE YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED....but 
before now didn't have the time and marketing 
strategies to make it all work. 

LEARN FROM A SUCCESSFUL PUBLISHER

After setting up an international import/export trade 
clearinghouse on the Internet which practically runs 
itself, I decided to put everything I've learned about 
off-line and on-line marketing systems into a new 
multimedia program. There is not an ounce of fat in 
the 155 pages because I've boiled down everything 
I know into an easy to read and follow step-by-step 
recipe for success. 

If you have an ounce of ambition and a couple of spare 
hours a day, you can achieve spectacular success operating 
from your home anywhere in the world.

WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM MY NEW MULTIMEDIA PROGRAM??

* If you are a busy PROFESSIONAL working those 60+ hour 
weeks you'll be amazed at how much money you can make 
working just a few hours a day.

* If you are a HOUSEWIFE and your hubby gives you 
$100 a week to feed and clothe your family and YOU 
WANT MORE don't get a divorce -- follow my instructions 
and earn that much an hour... legally :)

* If you are a STUDENT who doesn't have time between 
studies and parties to earn enough to make it all worthwhile 
this is exactly what you're looking for. You'll learn more 
practical money-making information in Business on a Disk 
than you could learn in four years of college. Get out of 
the Ivory Tower and learn something useful!

* If you are a frustrated WRITER, I'll show you exactly 
how to get your book published and market it yourself 
for enormous profits. You don't need to compete with 
300,000 other frustrated writers to get published -- 
do it yourself like I've always done and turn your work 
into almost instant cash. 

My first year, I sold 10,000 books at $12 each -- and 
I did it the hard way - by expensive snail mail! You'll 
do even better on the Internet.

I'll show you how to turn information products you create 
(or find) into on-going income streams that bring you 
a raging river of CASH day in and day out 365 days a year.
Best of all, most of my strategies require little or 
NO MONEY TO START!

LOOK WHAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE DONE!

* Jerry Sutton used the second technique to sell 
22,000 booklets at almost $20.00 each... AND IT 
COST HIM NOTHING TO GET ALL THOSE ORDERS! 
Imagine, over $396,000 income within 60 days....
FOR NOTHING! I reveal the details of his technique 
in my book.

* An airline pilot and amateur writer named Harold Moe 
used this next technique to sell 181,000 recession 
survival kits for housewives. Each order brought him 
$20....$3,620,000 income. You'll learn exactly how 
he did it and even the name and address of the publisher 
he used to accomplish this amazing feat.

* I used the fourth technique to sell 35,000 copies of 
my book Mind Over Money for $12. each. Then I went on to 
sell 3000 copies of another book, this time at $59.95 each...
in just 90 days! My backend offer made me another 
$120,000.00 that same year!

* The National Enquirer sells millions of booklets 
every year using the fifth technique. A modification 
to their system I've devised adds so much bottomline 
income that you will be able to earn a substantial 
piece of this lucrative business.

EIGHT SECRET STRATEGIES

Here's a brief look at just some of the benefits 
you'll enjoy: 

* Earn enough to retire while you are still young 
  enough to enjoy it.

* Live and operate from anywhere in the world right 
  from your home.

* No employees needed - most everything is done via 
  the miracle of technology.

* Work just a few hours a week for maximum results. 

* Build a valuable business you can pass on to your 
  children and grandchildren.

* Women, housewives and minorities cannot be held back 
  from success - no limits to your success!

* Gain the freedom to take time off - even extended 
  vacations - while your publishing business runs on 
  "autopilot".

* Earn more in a week than the 'average Joe' earns 
  in a good month.

* Gain prestige and recognition by becoming a widely 
  read author/publisher.

* Run a virtually paperless office - no employees - 
  no paperwork- no hassles.

* You can operate your business in complete privacy 
  if you wish making thousands of dollars a day quietly 
  and without attracting undue attention.

* If you wish you can set up 'offshore' in a tax-free 
  municipality thereby avoiding excessive taxation.

"I have gone through your Business on a Disk very

adapting it to his/her particular business it would 
surely lead to success!  I wish you continued success 
in getting your program into the hands of many who will 
benefit from it in their endeavors. " 
Patty Sachs, Celebration Expert and Author

"Thank you for your timely delivery of BOD, I've enjoyed 
it immensely. Here's why: 1) I've been struggling for 
quite some time trying to figure out what entrepreneurial 
trail to follow but now, thanks to your book "Business on 
a Disk" I have several workable options to pursue. 
2) I believe a serious entrepreneur can learn plenty from 
an examination of BOD, especially if they are willing to 
apply the various techniques suggested in the latter 
chapters of the book. Again, let me take this opportunity 
to thank you for a book of words well written. : )"
Marty Hinson, Ideal Enterprises

"I find your program is mind-blowing. The information 
that is available in your program is worth a fortune 
and I certainly do not need to look elsewhere anymore. 
Also to be able to actually talk to you means a lot to me,

rare these days. I wish you and yours continued success."

Dear Subscriber,

	All Majordomo mailing lists at tcp.com were down this weekend due
to a configuration error which made a critical directory unwriteable by
the Majordomo mail handlers.  The lists are now back in operation, however
any messages sent since Friday morning have been lost.  I apologize for
this error.

GA is not an option, it doesn't need to be negotiated.  There is no such
command as IAC WILL GA or IAC DONT GA; I don't know what your server is
really sending, but it's not IAC WILL GA.  To use GA, a server should just
send IAC GA (255 249) at the end of each prompt.

There is an option called SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD (3), maybe that's what you're
thinking of.  Obviously TF would not agree to _suppress_ GA, since it
wants to use GA for prompt marking.

You can observe telnet negotiation in TF if you "/set telopt on".  Options
that TF does not recognize will be printed in decimal.  "SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD"
is abbreviated "SGA".

In the world of muds where ANSI colour is becoming more and more frequent,
I've noticed a problem with tinyfugue and tabstops.  It would appear that tf
counts escape codes as spaces when calculating tab distances.

My mud has an escape code (Esc[0m) at the beginning of every long
description.  When there are more than one paragraph, the first paragraph
only indents 4 spaces while the rest are 8 (with the default tablength
setting)


Thanks for your time.

When a trigger is evaluated, the variable %* contains the full line.
So, put /echo %* somewhere in the trigger body.

Thanks to the decent example at the end of /help replace, I've been
able to get TF to reqrite some of my incoming channels.  However, I
don't see how I can change the display color at the same time.  Is it
possible?

    I have two pretty easy questions.  The first, dealing with a fuction of 
TF, while the last is a macro question.

    Firstly, is there a way to tell TF that I want -all- /log files to end 
up in one directory (in this case, logs)?  For example, I assume that

        /log ~/logs/tiny.log

would work, but I was wondering if there's a way that I can have TF just 
ASSUME that I want it to go to '~/logs' automagically.

    Secondly, while I know that I CAN log events that occured in the pass 
(some of you might not know this, so I guess this is my way of adding a 
little something to the list).  With

        /log -g tiny.log
        /recall -w <number of lines back>
        /log -w tiny.log

I can insure that even past events of mine will get logged -- because SO 
often, something happens to me BEFORE I think that it might be a good idea 
to start logging.  You know, like the trusting sod that I am. :)  But back 
to my question -- is there any way to write this up in a macro that'll take 
advantage of all the features?  I tried to write one and I failed -- alot.  
Hopefully someone out there is alot better at this sorta thing then I am.

Thanks.

or

Find and download a ready-to-run package like the rpm for RedHat.

Probably you forgot about file namem hmm, such a thing should work fine:

/log -i whatever.log

it'd log all the input into file whatever.log

I'm not sure whether it's possible to log input only when you have a
particular world on ther background, correct me, but it's impossible? at
least such a thing:

/log -wmy_world -i whatever.log doesn't work

I have never had problems with compiling tf. under solaris, red hat, debian
and others and am rather lame about it, so am sure you'll install it without
problems, heh.

If you can get Linux installed on a laptop, you can no doubt get TF
installed on it too. The install isn't complicated in itself, just a
matter of compiling it a la standard when it comes to a *NIX app.

Now, customising TF until it suits you... _there_ is a project! :)

/help really is useful. straight from /help %1

  1, 2, 3, etc.
     selects the corresponding positional parameter.  There is no maximum
     parameter number; any number greater than %{#} will simply produce
     an empty substitution.

  -1, -2, -3, etc.
     selects all positional parameters except the first, all except the
     first two, all except the first three, etc.

BAH!  Slipped on the send key.  Anyway, it's the first software I direct
newbie Linux users to, and I've not had reports of any problems from them.  
Something about reading the directions. ;)

I'm trying to write a process to /kill certain process by using the /ps 
command.

I have a repeat process running called 'booger' that goes off every 15 
minutes.
Booger is tied to process that evaluates a /rand number and performs an 
action if
the number matches 100.  I'm also trying to get Booger to /kill the /repeat 
process when it matches the /rand number as well.

I've tried the following, but it doesn't seem to work right.

/def booger = /booger_1%;/repeat -00:15 1 \
/booger%;/kill %booger_pid%;/set booger_pid=%?

Here is the output of /ps:
1  0:00:01 repeat                0:00:01     1 /log_on
2  0:27:31 repeat                0:30:00     1 /booger

Note, I don't want to /kill all the processes, only Booger.

Anyone have a solution?

Thanks

I was wondering if there are any plans to implement some sort of
client-to-client file transfer ability, such as DCC SEND (which IRC
clients use; specifications at
http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/dccspec.html).

This would allow two people on the same MU** to directly send files to
each other, much like the way two people on IRC can, without relying on
e-mail or ICQ, etc.

;You don't need to kill the /booger process, since the /return is only
executed once, 
;but anyway here's the entire thingie.

/def booger = \
	/repeat -00:00:01 1 /rand_number%;\
	/set booger_pid=%?

/def rand_number = \
	/unset number%;\
	/set number=$[rand(99,100)]%;\
	/eval /echo %number%;\
	/if ({number} =~ "100") \
		/do_some_process%;\
	/else \
		/booger%;\
	/endif

Actually, that isn't what I'm looking for.  I can do the random part already. 
 I realized I left something out when I wrote my initial email.  I want to 
kill the process that is being /repeated when ever the game I play reboots or 
crashes.  I don't want to have a bunch of the Booger processes running, only 
one at any given time.  If I don't kill it after a reboot/crash, another gets 
spawned and then I have two (or more).

Thanks

Hi,

After spawning a process you can acces its pid via the special
variable %{?}. So you can save the pid to a global variable 
and kill the process via a DISCONNECT hook. 

More precisely:

/def spawn=/repeat -n1 -n2 /your_action%;/set %{spawn_pid}=%{?}
/def -hDISCONNECT =/kill %{spawn_pid}
 
Boris

Hmm, you want something like this?

/repeat -5 1 say s

Hmm..

  I recently went through some scripts of mine and found
some matches like

/def -mregexp -F -i -PCgreen -t"\(hiding\)" hi_hiding
/def -mregexp -F -i -PCgreen -t"\(sneaking\)" hi_sneaking

  Not very quick, I though.. Why use regexps on such a simple
match.. So I changed it to

/def -msimple -F -i -PCgreen -t"(hiding)" hi_hiding
/def -msimple -F -i -PCgreen -t"(sneaking)" hi_sneaking

  But now something odd happened.. I started matching "hiding"
without the parenthesises.. Have I missed something here, does
the parenthesises have some undocumented function, or whats
happening ??

  Anyone got any ideas ??

( and ) are special to regular expressions. If you put something in ()'s,
then whatever is matched in the () can be used in a variable. (Not sure on
the details, read the docs)

At first, I thought Ch'marr was right... but then I noticed you switched to
simple mode (-msimple). I don't know, I thought that () characters were just
plain characters in simple mode... it would make sense that with simple
matching (-msimple) it wouldn't do that with the () characters. I don't
know. Maybe it is a bug.

But he did /def -msimple, so shouldn't that be simple matching style, not
regular expression matching style?

  But now something odd happened.. I started matching "hiding"
  without the parenthesises.. Have I missed something here, does
  the parenthesises have some undocumented function, or whats
  happening ??

the -P<n> options implies -mregexp so the -msimple option is simply
ignored if a -P<n> option is given
(see /help def)

That's exactly right.  If you "/list hi_hiding" afterwards, you'll see
the -m option isn't there.  Now, you might consider it a bug that tf just
dropped it without warning you, and I might agree; I'll make it generate
a warning in the next release.

   I did list hi_hiding afterwards and did notice that -msimple was
gone, though I (wrongly) assumed this was due to -msimple being my
default type..
   How come all partial hilights has to be regexps ??  Just because
the implemetation allows hilighting just a sub-expression of the trigger
pattern ??

Hi,

I'm currently using something along the lines of:

/def rstr = /echo %{R}

/def desc = /echo $(/rstr \
battered tawny beautiful new screaming drunk stumbling bruised pert \
evil good fantastic sizzling rabid spanked holy satanic)

/def mmm = /if ({1} =~ "") %; \
/send think mmmm... $(/desc) %; \
/else \
/send ;licks you . o O ( mmmm... $(/desc), yet $(/desc) ) | %{1} %; \
/endif

Now...this works perfectly. What I'd like to do is twofold.

First:

Is it possible to expand /desc to allow phrases to be randomly selected,
such as "mind boggling", instead of single words? I tried enclosing
phrases in quotes, but this didn't work.

I have no idea if i'm approaching this wrong, so any hints would be
helpful :)

Second:

I tried using alias.tf to allow me to /alias mmm /mmm, but I discovered
that using the alias doesn't pass parameters to the macro. Is there an
(easy!) way to work it so that I can have the alias functionality, and
have parameters passed on? If there's a patch/hack I can apply to
alias.tf, that'd be great...but any other solutions are greatfully
appreciated :)

Many thanks in advance,

Mo.

Has anyone created a set of macros to use TF as a multi-descer on 
MUSH-style  worlds, that they would be willing to post to the list, or send 
in e-mail? Or a link location to find such a beastie?

I have a simple hook I use whenever I connect to any of my worlds:

/def -Fp5 -h'connect' connect_doing = /repeat -1 1 /dorand

However, I've discovered through trial and error, that it does not send to 
the world of connection, but, to the world in the foreground at the time 
the delay ends.

There are times when I am connected, and immediately change worlds to 
another session. I want this hook to send to the world of connection, not 
to the one presently in the foreground. What are my options?

For a specific and odd use of TF, I need to be able to run TF as a
detached process, without a TTY. Screen (and similar programs) aren't an
option. Does anyone have any ideas?

My only idea so far, is to cut TF into a display-client responsible for
the display and keyboard, and a daemon responsible for everything else.
Allowing the two to talk through some form of IPC (maybe even a TCP 
socket =) means that I retain the ability to occasionally connect up to TF
and issue a command here or there, without interrupting the connection to
the various worlds the TFBot will be talking to.

I suppose, if I did it right, I could also use this feature to keep from
having to kill TF when I go home and forget to log out at work. I tend not
to log my connections, so killing TF loses anything that has occurred
since I left work. 

I've done a bit of coding along these lines so far, but it's not anything
I'm real proud of. What I'm really hoping is for an idea that allows me to
be 'lazy' and use someone else's pre-written solution ... =)

Why are screen etc not options?  What about expect?

|Why are screen etc not options?  What about expect?

Partly because the tf-daemon will be living on a very small linux
partition on a CompactFlash disk in a router. Part of its job is to pass
things like in-case temperature, free memory, load average, etc, on to the
mush that we use as an administrative environment.

We tried screen, but the results were kind of unreliable. We're still
looking into that to see if we can track down why. 

Besides, if TF had a stated protocol for interacting between a tf-console
process and a tf-daemon process, anybody could write a tf-console for any
environment without having to modify the tf distribution in any way.
One of my colleagues would like to write a GTK tf-console that allows him
to define that certain streams are their own windows, while leaving a
central window that behaves similarly to the normal TF console. I don't
know exactly what makes him want to do this, but the point is that he will
be able to do this if he wants to, and his code would not have to be
recompiled just because TF changed versions. And, assuming TCP sockets for
IPC, he wouldn't have to give up his nice interface to talk to
tf-daemons running on different kinds of machines.

Add -w${world_name} as an option to /repeat (check /ps - the process should
remember what world it is in).

TF can run without a TTY (redirect stdin, stdout, and stderr to/from files),
and there are several ways to control tf other than a TTY, provided you set
them up in advance:

1) A trigger or set of triggers to respond to commands you whisper to it
   on the mush.  Doesn't work if tf loses its connection to the mush.
   (You'll have to do your own authentication.)

2) /def -hSIGUSR1 sigusr1_hook = /load sigusr1.tf
   This lets you write aribrary tf commands into the file "sigusr1.tf" then
   send a SIGUSR1 to the tf process to make it execute them.  (Authentication
   is provided by OS privileges on sending signals and writing the file.)

3) Use a fifo, with tfread() and tfwrite().  Details left to the reader. :)

4) Write a little server in perl, and have tf connect to it.  The little
   server also accepts connections from a remote controller, and
   forwards data between the controller and tf.  Use triggers in tf to
   respond to controller commands.  (You'll have to do your own
   authentication.)

Method #4 is the closest to what you asked for; the little server accepts
connections on behalf of tf, since tf can't.  Of course, you could make
the little server connect directly to the mush and implement your features
itself, avoiding tf altogether.

It's obvious that TF has gotten rather more capable than the last time I
seriously grubbed around in its guts =) Your method #4 would satisfy my
official needs without serious multi-socket programming on my part, and I
guess I'll have to debug screen for the rest. Thanks also for the signal
handler idea; it has obviously been too long since I have thoroughly read
the documentation.... Upgrading my sources by means other than diffs has
its disadvantages... =)

Hi,

I'm sorry if this has been mentioned before... but is there a stable version of
tf or is it just planned to support ipv6? There are muds supporting ipv6, so
it's time to have tf support it, too. :-)
At the moment I use it with a little trick and a portmappers help, but it would
be nice if tf could support this :)

Regards,

Erik Meusel

I have a patch to make TinyFugue work with IPv6 (tested on Linux and BSD).
It's rather a hack, but I'll mail it to you if you're interested.

The patch is now also available from ftp://mud.stack.nl/pub/tf/contrib/
I don't know if it works on any other system (or system version) than
those which I tested myself. And it will probably break 'tf' completely
if your system does not support IPv6. In short: use at your own risk ;-)

Hi!
I am writing an ID script for mud.( IF anyone has any good, can
he email me and spare me time for coding)

Heres the problem. Is there a way to match multiple things in one line
and then make something respectivly of matched text.

FOr example in one line I have like: ANTI_THIEF ANTI_WARRIOR text
and the code is like this for THIEF and WARRIOR. What happens is that
its only the first word (anti-thief) is triggered, not both.


def -p1 -mregexp -t'ANTI_THIEF' objantithief = \
 /set id_variable=$[strcat({id_variable},' AT')]%;

Not sure quite what you mean, but if you specify the type of mud correctly
with /addworld (the -T option), there are some login hooks in the standard
libraries that should log you in properly (assuming you've also specified
your password in /addworld).

use the -F option on both your triggers, so both of them can be matched
on the same line.  (see /help def, the -F section.)

TF 5.0 will support IPv6 on any platform with the RFC 2553 or 2133 API,
and will of course continue to support IPv4.  I don't know when TF 5.0
will be released, but I am working on it.

You can use command syntax:
	/repeat -0:00:02 1 /leader_tell %*
or function syntax:
	/repeat -0:00:02 1 /test leader_tell({*})

I also recommend naming the trigger macro.

By default, a given line can trigger only one macro.  To allow multiple macros
to be triggered, define them with the -F (fall-thru) flag.

Instead of killing the process, why not just not start it in the first place?

/def booger =  \
    /if (rand(100) == 0) \
        do something%; \
    /else \
        /repeat -0:15 1 /booger%; \

Command form does not allow quoting, but function form does.  So redefine
rstr to be called as a function:

  /def rstr = /result - %{R}

And then use it like

  /def desc = /echo $[rstr("mind boggling", "finger-licking good", "morally \
      bankrupt")

You have to pass the parameters when you define the alias:

  /alias mmm /mmm %{*}

However you want!

Say, put this in an endless /repeat, to be executed at midnight every day:

/log -w${world_name} off
/log -w${world_name} log/${world_name}-$[ftime("%Y%m%d", time())]

Better would be to place that in your startup/connection script... not
everyone leaves TF on 24 hours a day to change the log at midnight.

OK i have some questions regarding tf...

1. What is the RIGHT way to clean a variable after a macro has been
executed???By cleaning i mean seting it to be empty.

2.Lets presume that i have spammed couple of spell commands. Now,
lets presume that another thing occured (like comming of 10 more
nasty mobs in room) while executing those spell commands i spammed.
NOW, is there a way to interrupt these commands, that is, is there a
priority that can break this spam?


3. Is there a way to implement chat protocol in tf, like mudmaster or
ZMud, or mcl has it??

Thx

Use local variables in your macros. Set by "/let" and cleaned by tf himself,
after executing the macro.

Umm... if you throw the spells with a /repeat or similar you can kill it
with /kill.

And it itsn't 1 macro, its whole bunch of macros put in one file. And more
than one macro is using same variable so it has to be set globaly(I
think).

/unset deletes global variables.

The text has probably already been sent to the server by the client, and
thus TF can do nothing about it after it's left the client and gone to
the server's command stack..

So where is this chat protocol used? Some people have been writing IRC
scripts for TF, but I have no idea what their current status is.

TF can't do anything about it unless the server implemented commands to do
so.  I actually know of a mud that implemented a "future" command to see
the command queue (it's a queue rather than a stack) and a "forget"
command to clear it.

Someone asked me to post this here....

/bind ^[1 = /world Favorite_World
/bind ^[2 = /world Another_World
/bind ^[m = /sh pine

This lets you start connections to worlds with Escape <number> and to flip
through themm instead of Esc b and Esc f.

Yes, you have to remember which world is where, but you remember it
quickly :)

Hello,

when I am logged in on two or more different worlds at the same time I get 
messages like:

% Activity in world xyz
% Trigger in world xyz

all the time.
Is there a way to suppress those messages? I dont want to know about this 
since it happens most of the time anyway (channel messages and such).

Thanks for your help.

Harry

To silence the % Trigger in world (Likely the more annoying one if you
have a lot of triggers) you can do:
/def -ag -hBACKGROUND
Alternatively if you use /def to define triggers, adding the -q flag to
all your triggers would work too.

To silence the % Activity in world uou can do:
/def -ag -hACTIVITY

I'm currently re-working the telnet negotiation code in my talker
codebase, and I was trying to figure out if there was any way to reliably
detect TinyFugue as a client.

Most telnet clients honour TELOPT_TTYPE, and my server performs the
subnegotiation and uses the appropriate per-terminal-type
options. However, users of TinyFugue (a fair proportion, including
myself) must enter terminal type manually ('ansi' being the best match in
this case). So, if TinyFugue could be detected reliably, without breaking
other clients (and preferably without having to work the telnet
negotiation in strange and wonderful ways).

If it's any help, the preferred world type used for connecting to my
server is -Tlpp, although many people simply use /connect, or for whatever
other reason don't select a world type, in which case TF detects the world
as unterminated prompt (which works fine).

Any information would be appreciated :)

[To Ken Keys: Are there any plans to make TF allow and respond to TTYPE
subnegotiation, i.e., in 40s2, if it ever sees the light of day? :)]

Mo.

TF 5.0 (not released) already supports TTYPE.  It responds with these
strings:  "TINYFUGUE", "ANSI-ATTR", and "UNKNOWN".  The reason for
"ANSI-ATTR" instead of "ANSI" is that TF only supports the ansi attributes,
not other ansi display commands like cursor movement.  Assuming you just
want your server to do ansi attributes, and not anything TF-specific, the
best choice for your server to accept would be "ANSI-ATTR".

Unfortunately, none of those strings (other than "UNKNOWN") are standard.
Maybe I will add "ANSI" as a choice after "ANSI-ATTR".  It's technically
wrong, but a lot of muds will recognize it and send only attribute codes
without causing any problems.  Perhaps it's better for TF to lie a little
in order to support attributes more automatically.

I'd be inclined to agree..

Any MUD which forces ANSI character-mode and movement operations purely on
the basis of a TTYPE returning 'ANSI' would be considered broken IMHO, as
I can think of several linemode-only clients which send 'ansi' (as they
support ANSI attributes).

Plus, as a user, I'd find it annoying and complain to the respective coder
bitterly (I tend to set my termtype as 'ansi' when using TF, and I know a
lot of others that do too) :)

I want to be able to put TF in a mode where, if there's activity
in a world, it automatically switches to that world.  Then another
macro to turn the behavour off.

I'm sure this has something to do with hooks but i'm not sure
what.  Can anybody help?

Thats easy.  (Disclaimer: I'm writing this right now..  YMMV)

/def watchactiveon = /def -h"activity *" -ag wahook = /world %%1
/def watchactiveoff = /undef wahook

A brief explanation of what this does:

The watchactiveon defines the hook macro.  The hook macro simply responds
to activity * (Activity in any world) and gags the message (Otherwise the
% Activity message comes after the world switch) then switches to the
world.  The reason for the %% is so that it gets evaluated by wahook not
watchactiveon.

The watchactiveoff simply undefines the hook.

And this has been tested - I justy tested it now. :)

Now getting this to trigger automatically on idleness and deactivate on
unidleness is left as an excercise to the user.

/def -Fp5 -mglob -h'ACTIVITY *' activity_fg_hook = /fg %{*}

/def turn_off_activity_fg_hook = /undef activity_fg_hook

If you want macros to just toggle that behaviour... well, start with the

howdy,

I got this problem when making my status field in
funky colors. ;)

When I use status_attr=C<color> it only works
correct with white.. on the different stuff I
wanna show. The help files says that if you use
'x' colors will not overlap eachother. But I've
tried everything I know of, and still haven't
gotten any further. Anyone managed to use normal
white when using status_attr=BCgreen e.g ?

Would rock lots if someone knew what to do.

I know that feeling.
The problem is that any attribute set on the status bar will be
inherited by every atom in it as well. So when the bar is blue
and an atom is red, the result will become (Ick!) purple. I too
have tried to find a solution, but in vain.

Anyone know the solution, give me a  holler as well.

Two things:


1. I'm looking for a guy that over a year ago sent me an automapper for
tinyfugue. It was a programme that was converting lines after /savepath into
a map. I lost the file and I need it atm. Anyone got exactly that or
something similar?

2. Is there any archive of this list? Can I download it or someone is able
to send me a whole thing or a part of that? Am trying to write some Polish
help (heh, am not good, but better than average) about tf and it would be
really helpful (for some faqs and such).

Hello all,

Two things:

1. Anyone have any idea why /beep works just fine for me, but
/set hiliteattr=b doesn't?

2. I think I've found a small bug in stdlib.tf. whisper hiliting doesn't
work if the string is of the format

  Joe whispers, "hi."

I was able to fix this by shifting the ( to the left of the space:

  ( to [^ ]*)?

-Suzanne

Hey there.

In the Mud I play, you can remember people. This results in a list that
looks like this:

name1, name2, name3,
name4, name5,
name6, name7, name8, name9

Issuing the command 'remember name2' will return a string like this:
You remember name2 as a male wizened young elf.

The list itself can be up to ... 1000 names, and you'll quickly loose
overview, because sadly someone forgot to add a command to 'remember
wizened elves' which could give you the names of all wizened elves you
know.
What I tried to accomplish was a macro that would issue 
'remember namex' for each name in the list, regarless of how many there
are, and put the output in a file. Even better would be, if the
output-file-format could be variably determined by settings I issue.
Like normally it would have x-lines with 'You remember aaa as bla', 'You
remember aab as blubb'. I imagine it should somehow be possible to create
two files, one with 'name as description' entries and one with 'description
as name' entries, so that I could issue a grep command from within tf to
get a list of the names whos description features wizened, for example.

Help ? (*thanks in advance*)

9 is the discard service:  you send stuff, you get nothing.
7 is the echo service:  you send stuff, you get it back.

They're only going to be present on unix systems, and these days some
people leave them off for security reasons.

Don't you know whether it's possible to bind, hmm, symbolic keys with some
other keys, like control?
For instance I have a bind:

/def -B'UP' tata1 = /dopath up

but I want to press up key with Ctrl and do something else (on the mud it's
"moving in the chosen direction but, not noticed by anybody"). Is it somehow
possible, coz am not sure how to set it.

Hi,
I read the FM, but am still having trouble creating a macro.
Short take: I can't figure out what the list separator is for a list 
            containing a /sh as the first command.

Background:
===========
I'm on a student network, implemented with shared 10Base-T Ethernet. I
don't want my passwords and other information flying around, so I wish to
set up a SSH tunnel from my desktop machine, A, to a more secure host B,
from which the regular telnet connection to the muck actually is made. The
tf client runs on the desktop:

A==============B--------------Muck
^       ^      ^       ^        ^
TF   tunnel  secure  telnet   Port
              host            8889

The SSH part is "easy". On host A, I issue the command

	ssh -S -f -L 9999:muck.some.org:8889 B.some.org

which prompts me for the password, and sets up background forwarding for
port 9999 on A to B. Now, doing this by hand every time got boring, and I
figured I'd just set up a macro to build the tunnel and connect to a world
from within TF. Here's what I did (in .tfrc):

/addworld sshCharacter <Charname> <MuckPassword> localhost 9999
/def Character = \
	/sh ssh -S -f -L 9999:muck.some.org:8889 B.some.org %; \
	/world sshCharacter

Problem:
========
The world is defined fine. The macro "Character" is defined as the shell
command, just fine, and works. But to the death of me I can't figure out
how I get the "Character" macro to also run the "/world" command. I also
tried plain ;, \%; and \; as the list separators, as well as /@sh as the
shell command. Every time the macro is defined as the first line, and the
second line is executed as if there was no line continuation character. 

By putting everything on one line one can see that apparently the list
separation symbols get simply taken as part of the /sh argument. (The
command passed to the shell ends up "ssh -S -f -L 9999:muck.some.org:8889
B.some.org %; /world sshCharacter", where the ssh part is executed dandy,
and then I get an error message telling me there is no /world command on
this system.)

The TF version in use is: % TinyFugue version 4.0 stable 1

Ideas, or pointers to the documentation I missed?

Thanks, 

	Toivo

Hi!

I would like to direct all tells i get on a mud to a file on the linux 
server where i run TF.
Tells look like this:
Gandalf tells you 'Blah blah blah'

Does anyone have an idea on how to do that?

I will log on to the linux server using a second connection and in that 
telnet window i will use the tail command to
view the textfile and see the new tells as they come into the file.

How about this:

/def -Fq -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ tells you \'.*\'$' some_trigger_name = \
  /expr fwrite("tellsfile.txt", {*})

/set logpath=~techno/log/

/def -p100 -ag -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ tells you \'(.*[^\'])\'$' logtel =  \
  /log %{logpath}tellog%;\
  /eval /echo -ag $[ftime("%m/%d/%y-%H:%M:%S",time())]%;\
  /echo -p @{Cwhite}%1 @{Cred}tells you @{Cwhite}%P1%;\
  /log off

Then you can do the following in another shell.

tail -f ~techno/log/tellog

Of course you'll want to replace techno with your own user name.

I used to use something like this to send 'em to a file, though in a
different format than they came from the server.  Adjust to your needs,
especially the path and file ;-)

/def -mregexp -t"^([^ ]+ tells you ')(.+)" logTellsYou = \
        /set tellLog $[tfopen("~/path/and/file","a")] %;\
        /test tfwrite({tellLog}, strcat({P1}, {P2})) %;\
        /test tfwrite({tellLog}, "") %;\
        /test tfclose({tellLog})


Cheers,
Arjan

err, i followed the directions on the website to install, basically alot
of stuff filled up my screen.  i could only read the last bit, anyhow.

i suppose i need to do something along hte line of

./configure
make

and then copy a file so i can run it from whichever account?

this is a bit mysterious to me.

thanks,

Jesse

about installing tf:
1. tar xzf tinyfuguexxxx.tar.gz ( or gunzip tinyfuguexxxx.tar.gz;tar xf
tinyfuguexxxx.tar). replace
xxxx with the version number, actually the filename.
when its untared, change to the directory and if on a unix:
./unixmake
and copy to wherever. and you're done.

I didn't realize, but several diff persons contacted me, and I did get
tfugue installed (as root).  thanks :)

i haven't yet found a helpfile saying how to start tinyfugue, nor how to
create triggers/etc though. (?)

ok. change to your tinyfugue dir, the one with the "tf" executable, unless
its in your path and do:
tf -n
or if it aint in your path:
./tf -n
then once in the client, type /help
i assume you are a unix newbie.

Didn't you know that FORTRAN is condensed evil? FORTRAN is the programming
language of choice in hell, though admittedly not for the really evil
programmers... I hear Microsoft employees have to program in AS/400...
without the benefit of column guidelines.

I have to ask.  What is "AS/400"?  Last I knew, it was a machine that IBM
made, and not a programming language.  Do you maybe mean PL/1 or BAL?

I took a class, programming in some column based programming language on the
AS/400... I loathed the class, despised the teacher, and soon quit the
program. I probably do mean something like PL/1 or whatever, but the class
was called 'AS400', and was a pre-requisite for 'COBOL' so while the teacher
probably said what the actual name of the programming language was at one
point, that true fact surrendured to the flood of falsehood, and the
language (with its horrible column sheets, stilted syntax, ... gah, too evil
to mention) has remained in my mind as 'AS/400', despite the fact that I
know it was the OS that was called AS/400, not the language.

for the following trigger what does the '-t' do?
/def -t"1: Enter the game." choice = 1


and this has defined a macro trigger called choice that simply enters a
one, is that correct?

That is correct.
By default (without the -t"..." option) a macro can only be called using
"/choice" and it does not trigger on any action.
So /def -t is a bit like /trig ;-)

/def -t"Your ship lands next to you." entership  = enter ship
/def -t"You enter the ship." inship = listdest all

both of those work fine. what i would like to do is "enter ship" and then
"list dest all" and then even type "exp" to see how much money my
character has.  right now i'm doing the first two in a sort of clumsy way.

;/def time_warp = :jumps to the left!%;:steps to the right!

i do have this (commendted out) example which seems to do what i want, but
i only get errors trying to build on it.

what i want is something along the lines of:

/def -t"Your ship lands next to you." entership  = enter ship;listdest all

where i just do two things, sequentially.  hopefully my question makes
sense :)

in the time_warp example, by the way, what does the % do?  some sort of
pattern matching??

thanks for all the help,

Jesse

whee. ok, this is like my first halfway useful trigger. but, i'm runing

if i edit and re-save modifications to my tfrc file, then from tf type
/quit and the "tf" again, it loads my new tfrc file, right?

is there a better way to update the tfrc file on-the-fly like?

HP: 387/387  CP: 490/490  ADRENALINE: 0  BERSERK: 4  ENEMY: 2%

is a fairly typical line. for this line I have trigger:

/def -t"{*}HP:{*}" combat = \
        confuse%;\
        heartplunge%;\
        dart%;\
        dart%;\
        grab weapon%;

this is pretty straighforward, but it does save me alot of typign, if i
can get it to work. i don't think i'm doing the pattern matching correctly
(?)

any advice?  eventually i want to add some if statements in there,
depending on the numbers.

thanks,

Jesse

See /help glob - anything in {} only matches a single word - and you've
got multiple words following HP:

I'm going to jump to what you'll really need (making decisions based on
the values), and use regexps for pattern matching (fun if you've never
used them before - /help regexp):

/def -mregexp \
     -t"^HP: ([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)  CP: ([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)  ADRENALINE: ([0-9]+) \
        BERSERK: ([0-9]+)  ENEMY: ([0-9]+)%$" combat = \
          confuse%;\
          heartplunge%;\
          dart%;\
          dart%;\
          grab weapon

(The numbers are popped into the variables %P1 through %P7 so you can look
at the values later.)

Sure.  Use /load to load the file with your stuff.  Make sure to name all
your triggers and whatevers, so the old one will be replaced by the new
one.

i admit that went a bit over my head.

for now, i'm just looking to recognize whenever a line begining with
"HP:" occurs.  (at some point i will need to put some if statements in
there, and a counter also.  for now that's just too complex)

I misunerstood something or you just want something like that: 


/def -t"Your ship lands next to you." entership  = enter ship%;listdest all

coz commands are separeted with "%;" in tf

;/def -t"HP:{*} CP:{*} ADRENALINE:{*} BERSERK:{*} ENEMY:{*}" combat  = \

I also tried this, but it apparently didn't work, so i commented it out.

I also tried like

"HP:{*}/{*} "  and then the same for cp, etc

of course it is possible i had the right idea, but some syntax error. but
i don't so.

when I get a line of text beggining with "HP:", i want to define a trigger
called combat.

/def -t"HP:{*}" combat = \

does not work because there are multiple words. 

HP: ###/###  CP: ###/###  ADRENALINE: ###  BERSERK: #  ENEMY: ###%

is the line in question. the "#" can be any integer from zero to
nine.  however, my maximum and current hp can of course fluctuate. so, hp 
may sometimes be two, or even one #.  it could be 300 (three pound 
signs) or it could be 99 (two pound signs) or 9 (one pound 
sign). similarly for cp, adrenaline and enemy.

I tried somethign along the lines of:

/def -t \
   "HP:???????????????????????????????????????????????????????" \
   combat =

(but i put it on one line in my tfrc file) and i still couldnt get the
pattern to match.  i'm not sure why that didn't work, i figured the
maximum size of the line and put in the appropiate "?"'s.

please, pretend pattern matching seems real complex to me and makes little
to no sense.  ;)

Ok, let's go back to glob matching since you're getting the hang of it now
(and leave regexps until later when you need to do the complicated stuff).

Glob matches are anchored to the beginning and end of a line, unless you
start (or end) with a *.  So:

The glob  "HP:"  matches only the line "HP:"
The glob  "HP:*" matches any line starting with "HP:"  (anything can follow)
The glob  "*HP:"  maches any line ending with "HP:" (the * means "anything" -
and then "HP:" comes after the "anything", and then there's the end of line).

So, what you want in this situation is:

/def -mglob -t"HP: *" combat = \
          confuse%;\
          heartplunge%;\
          dart%;\
          dart%;\
          grab weapon

i dont even know how to use globs myself, I'm hooked on regexp.
what's the diff between * and {*}? and how are the parameters passed in glob? glob
could make my triggers simpler.

I'm not much of an expert, either :)

I also find this list to be quite an excellent resource.  I've asked
several questions here over the 2 years I've used TF and I've never once
not gotten help.  So, again, yay for all the people who share their
knowledge.

* matches anything, of any length - just like .* in regexp
{*} is like [^ ]+ in regexp - match anything that's just one word.
There are no %Pn variables used in globs - all you'd get is %1, %2, %-1, etc.

One other major difference between regexps and globs (other than regexps
are not bound to the start and end of line, whereas globs are, unless you
use * at start and/or end) is that regexps are case sensitive, and globs
are not case sensitive.

A lot of my simple triggers are defined with glob; only the more complicated
ones that take parameters and lots of conditional phrases are regexp'd.

I'd like to take what ever is at the end, it could be "bob", or whomever,
and put that into a variable.

would it be similar to:

/def -t"*You move quickly, confusing the hell out of %1" confused = \
	backstab tolower(%1)

You probably want 'backstab %2'. Each * is a parameter, thus the second
parameter (%2) will be filled by all the words that occur in the last glob.
The first parameter is all the characters that occur before the word 'You'.

In a glob pattern, "%1" does not define a substring match; it simply matches
"%1" literally.  There is in fact no way to extract substrings of a string
that matched a glob.  (In particular, "%n" will NOT give you the substring
matched by the nth "*".)

In the macro body, "%1" expands to the first word of the line that
triggered it.  So if the line was "You move quickly, confusing the hell
out of Bob.", then "%1" would expand to "You", "%2" to "move", etc.
Also "%L" would expand to the last word, which is "Bob.".  Note that
here a word is defined as a group of characters separated by spaces,
so the period is included when "Bob." replaces "%L".

Since you don't want the period, and there's no way to extract substrings
from globs, you must use a regexp.  In regexps, you put parentheses whereever
you want, and then %Pn will expand to the substring that was matched by the
nth set of parentheses.  So, you could use a regexp like this:

^You move quickly, confusing the hell out of (.*)\.$

"^" matches the beginning of the line.  (I assumed the leading "*" in
your example was a mistake; if not, omit the "^" from the regexp.) "$"
matches the end of the line.  ".*" matches 0 or more characters of any
kind.  "\." matches a period; the "\" is needed because "." by itself
is a metacharacter that matches any 1 character.  And when you put that
"\" between the quotes in /def -t"...", you need to change it to "\\",
because inside quotes "\" is a metacharacter.

Also, tolower() is a function.  To expand the value of a function within
a macro body, you must use the $[...] expression substitution.

Finally, within an expression, it's better to use "{P1}" notation instead
of "%P1" inside expressions.  Both work, but "%P1" can be more confusing
when writing complex macros.

Putting this all together, you get:

/def -mregexp -t"^You move quickly, confusing the hell out of (.*)\\.$" \
    confused = \
        backstab $[tolower({P1})]

For more information, see these /help topics:  patterns, triggers, /def,
substitution....

in general, and especially in tf, matching the beginning of the line
is really slow.  i have a little macro that goes through and sets up
hilites for peoples names.  the problem is that some names are likely
to occur in larger words ("rob" for instance).  i can't use globs
because i want partial hilighting on the names.  this leaves me with:

(^| )rob( |$)

because of the way i like to manage them, i don't have it all in one
line like:

(^| )(rob|frank|jim)( |$)

so, i end up with lots of regexps to do the name hiliting and a really
slow client.

is there any chance of a newer regexp library in the next tf release
(i.e. something that supports the perl/emacs regexp'ism \b for word
boundaries)?

A little birdie whispered in my ear that such a regexp package has already
been incorporated into (the still-being-worked-on) tf 5.0 release, with
lots of other cool new regexp capabilities as well.

Dunno about the other questions but you can use /repeat to have a macro
be called every second.  Here is the example from /help repeat in tf:

/DEF doodle_forever = /doodle%; /REPEAT -0:30 1 /doodle_forever


This calles doodle_forever once, every 30 seconds.

  I saw that you had already gotten an answer on question one, but if you
want it to run continously I would recommend setting up a repeat with a one
second delay and a really high count instead of setting a new repeat in
every execution..
  An example would be

/def mymacro = \
	dostuff1 %; \
	dostuff2

/repeat -0:0:1 86400 /mymacro

(86400 seconds in a day.. Should be enough for most uses..)

On question 2 I can't say if you can do it the way you describe, but you
could probably set up a macro loop that reads lines from a file/fifo with
tfread and then "execute" them with /eval.. This would also leave stdio 
(the keyboard) still useable.. Some simpler variant of this might be 
done with

/quote /eval '<filename>

where <filename> is a existing file without the <>.. This would more or
less try to run every line of that file as if it was entered from the
keyboard, I guess.. I'm not sure what the result would be if you tried it
with a fifo though, but why not try..

On question 3 I'm sure you know you can make macros to do this specifically
with something like tfwrite, but since I think you want some more general
thing I guess it's up to Ken..

Happy hacking,

   Alexander

The above example isn't slow, but "^" does get slow when it's followed by
".*" or other variant parts.  Usually any regexp you might want to write
like "^.*foo..." can be rewritten "foo..." to make it much more efficient.
And if you need to capture the left side, e.g get %P1 from "^(.*)foo...",
you can do that with %PL from "foo..." instead.

TF 5.0 (not released) already has PCRE (perl-compatible regular
expressions), which includes \b for word boundaries, case-insenstive
matching, {n,m} quantifiers, locale support, zero-width assertions, etc.

ok, with all the help y'all have given my, things are
getting big and complex.  so i'm going to start loading
files.

is it possible to always start tf with the same tfrc file,
and then have it prompt me for stuff like:

choose a) world blah b)world blahblah c)world blah3

and then based on the world, choose character, and
then like diff options per character?

or should i just make several different tfrc files to load
various configurations?  (not like i have more than two
versions of stuff right now)

Jesse

I have library files with the common triggers and macros, then have
separate (smaller) files for the character specific triggers.

When you start TF from the command line, you can start it as :-

  tf worldname

and it will automatically connect you to the world specified.

You can load the character specific files on a per worldname basis by
specifying the filename when you define the world in your .tfrc file.

eg :-

/addworld {worldname} {charname} {password} {hostname} {port} {filename}

If you don't mind, could you tell us what other kind of stuff you have
planned for 5.0?

Whee! Way back I remember ranting about the subject (why PCRE is the
choise for TF) - don't know if it did any difference but I'm glad to
see your choice has been a good one.

BTW. Do you precompile your regular expressions and store them as
compiled for matching? Do you study the input line for matching
(mostly useless though)?

Just start TF with a world name on the command-line. For example, I have
two worlds 'EK' and '22'. I can do:

tf EK

or 

tf 22

And TF does the rest.

The more recent copies of TF allow you to specify a TF file to be
associated with a world definition.

ie,
/addworld -T'type' world-name character password world port TF-file

/addworld -T'lp' foo Bar fred fred.foo.com 2323 ~/tf/Bar.tf

And calling /world foo would load character Bar and the associated
Bar.tf file.

I'd hope the regexps are precompiled and stored... I'm pretty sure they are
in current versions of tf, at least.

With PCRE, there's a function to 'study' the compiled regexp to possibly
speed up matching. It's only useful for non-anchored patterns without a
fixed starting character as of pcre 3.2. There's nothing special to do for
looking at the input line besides what pcre_exec does normally -- no
equilivent to perl's study.

For example, after the text "Jabba the Hutt goes east." matches the regexp 

  " goes ([^ ]*)\.$"

then the following expansions will be available until the macro exits: PL
= "Jabba the Hutt"; P0 = " goes east."; P1 = "east". 


instead, using regexp "^Jabba (^ ]*)\.$" on the same text

is there a way to get "goes" from the above example, with modified regexp?

of course, the idea is to be able to "get" some aribitrary word
from within any line of text starting with "Jabba".  for practical
purpose, I'm trying to figure out how to get the last three
words, individually.  there may be just one word after jabba,
like "jabba farts" or there could be, say, eight words after jabba.

hope you like my "farting" example :)

Jesse

(in line "A spacing guild soldier [seriously hurt]" i'm trying to
get "soldier" out of that, somehow. but the jabba example works
fine for me, if anyone can figure out/explain)

The best place for you to look would be at "/help %1" - it explains all
the different positional variables you have available to you.

Also, the variables %P1, %P2, etc will contain what was in the first
set of parentheses, the second set, etc.  So you can just put parentheses
around the part of the regexp you want to use later - or if you always
know where it will be in the sentence, use things like %3 (to get the
third word), %L2 (to get the second-to-last word), etc.

Trigger regexps in tf have always been stored compiled.  In the past,
regexps used by regmatch() were not, but they are in 5.0 if they are
constant.  This has nothing to do with the switch to PCRE; it is only
possible now because MACROS are now compiled.

I know that last statement is going to start a slew of questions, so
I'll answer a few right now.  The macro language has not changed to
support compiling; all existing macros will continue to work (faster
than before).  Compiled macros are significantly faster than uncompiled
macros, but I can't say exactly how much because it's highly variable,
and I'm still working on the optimizer.  Macros are not compiled to
machine code, but to a machine-independant tf-specific intermediate
langauge.  By default, a macro is compiled the first time it is run,
but you can tell tf to compile macros when they're defined, so you can
be told about syntax errors when you define macros instead of waiting
until you try to run them.

have this line a deriviative from a question earlier on in the list...
my question is this why do i get the following in my file?

In 5.0 from what I read from Ken Keys this will be awesome, one thing
that always bugged me was you had to run macros or triggers or anything
else to find syntax errors and TF wouldn't always tell you the exact
spot
err line number, like found '(' when expected 'ENDIF' but with no line
number
and I have some huge code 700 lines, it's really hard sometimes to find
the error so hopefully TF in the future will give linenumber.

Now one other thing I am not sure if it has been suggested is to group
macros triggers
defines, variables into one module.

Example you have a huge macro file that contains tons of triggers,
macros, variables, etc.
You have another file with the same thing, now in the current TF you can
load both
but they could conflict with eachother.  So what would really be nice is
if you could
compile a whole macro file into a module, then load the module, when you
don't want
to use it anymore you would unload it which would disable everything it
did.

Also and this would require new changes to the macro langauge is to make
it easier.
using dots for spaces

example
/def example = \
../set counter := 0%;\
../def subexample = \
..../set subcounter := 0%%;\
..../last line of subexample%;\

This can get really confusing what I would rather see is something like
this.

Define example()
{
....set counter := 0;
....Define subexample()
....{
........Set subcounter := 0;
........Last line of subexample
....}
}

It would still support the old too for backward compatability.  From my
experience
TF programming is not easy to learn.
This brings it closer to C, but hell of a lot easier esspecially if
you're doing complex
macro coding.  Also it would be nice to have case statements.  Anyways
any thoughts
comments ?

The regexp "^[^ ]+" matches any one word, at the end of the line:
^ forces to the beginning of the line
anything in [] is one character (e.g. [ab] is "a or b")
^ inside a [] is a negative (e.g. [^ab] is "any one char that's not a or b")
+ after a character-matching-pattern means "1 or more of what just came before"

Therefore [^ ]+ means "1 or more of any character that's not a space"
and ^ forces that to the start of the line.

(this happens to be the same as {*} in glob syntax, BTW)

And yes, you can call ftime from inside fwrite (TF allows nesting of
function calls, just like in C).  So, you could have a different file
for each day with something like:

   /expr fwrite(ftime("tellsfiles/%Y%M%d.txt", time()), {*})

Taking any programming language class would help with TF, because it helps
put you in a programming mindset, and generally understand more about how
things are put together.

More specifically, yes, learning C would help understand the TF syntax.
I recall finding my third year Scheme (Lisp-derived language) course dead
easy, because I'd already learned the syntax in MPI (a Tinymuck-fuzzball
server-side scripting language). :)

It depends on what you want to match.  The regexp yourself is fine, but
are you sure it matches what you want to match?
- not all your strings start with "A " (some of them are "An ")
- not all your strings end with "."

i actually wen't back and made additional triggers, for the "An ",
but "A " or "An " just isn't general enough, i now realize.

If i wander around the mud in "brief" mode, most always it looks
like

Into the warehouse.   [e,w,s,n].
A Spacing Guild soldier.

what i'm thinking is to match the "]." followed by the end of line,
and then look at just the next line "A spacing guild soldier."

partly for my own understanding, i want to use L1,L2 and assign
them to a variable. sortof like:

mob_to_kill = L1

and then i'd use the variable mob_to_kill in other places. but
i'd like to echo, or print out the variable mob_to_kill in the
same way /ver or /version gives information to the screen.

then i'd do
mob_to_kill = L2

I figure if i can look at what values mob_to_kill goes through, then
i can put in stuff to drop out periods, change case,etc. and then
use that variable in other places, of course.

the way i have it now, i'm basically guessing what tinyfugue is
doing.

The $[...] is expanded when the macro is expanded, not when the
expression is evaluated; don't use them.  And /expr echoes the value of
the expression, which here is the value of fwrite(), which is usually 1.
You just want to evaluate the expression, not echo it, so use /test.

You can also simplify the macro by putting the "guild-" part right in the
ftime() format, instead of using strcat().

As a side note, I recommend the format %Y-%m-%d for filenames:  It
makes the filenames sort nicely (and it's the ISO 8601 international
standard date format).  And finally, I recommend naming your macro, so
if you redefine it, the old one will get replaced by the new one,
instead of hanging around and causing confusion.

/def -Fq -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ guildtalks \'.*\'$' log_guildtalks = \
  /test fwrite(ftime("guild-%Y-%m-%d", time()), {*})

That works if you only connect to one world at a time, and undefine macros
(or quit tf) between worlds.  But a more general solution is to define
your triggers with

  /def -w<worldname> ...

Then, you can be connected to multiple worlds simultaneously and have all
the triggers for all the worlds defined, but they'll only match on the
world specified in their -w option.

I wonder if anyone could offer any suggestions on how to build a
"Shakespeare insult generator" for TF? 

The mechanics of it would be to combine three words from three 
lists of insults (http://www.pangloss.com/seidel/shake_rule.html) so as to
generate a random insult when you use an alias on the mud.

I freely admit I'm mostly from the cut-and-paste school of TF programming
and am looking for help on how to do this. :)

The "/test" causes an extra level of evaluation, so the %Y.. parts are
being parsed too soon (and interpreted as variable names).  So, add another
escape level:

/def -Fq -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ guildtalks \'.*\'$' log_guildtalks = \
  /test fwrite(ftime("guild-%%Y-%%m-%%d", time()), {*})

Ok, say the matching line is
Murf gets mud from the low level donation chest

So the macro is run, and all of this below is queued in the process list:

  loom Murf%;\
  tell Johnn Murf gets mud from the low level donation chest%;\
  tell Thalasian Murf gets mud from the low level donation chest%;\
  tell Gisselle Murf gets mud from the low level donation chest%;\
  /test fwrite(ftime("WWW/townsends/rod/logs/chest-%%Y-%%m-%%d",time()),\
               {Murf gets mud from the low level donation chest})

Now see the problem?  {foo} (in expression syntax) means "the contents
of variable foo", just like %foo or %{foo} in macro syntax.

What you want, instead of    {%{*}}    is    "%{*}"

Tag the time on inside the file?  Sure - you could use something like
   strcat(ftime("%%%T ", "%{*}")  in place of just "%{*}" above.

That works, IF the line doesn't contain any double-quotes.  If it does, e.g.,

    Murf gets "mud" from the low level donation chest

then the command would expand to

    /repeat ... \
      /test fwrite(ftime("WWW/townsends/rod/logs/chest-%%Y-%%m-%%d",time()),\
        "Murf gets "mud" from the low level donation chest")

which is an invalid expression.  Using %%%{*} would fix the problem; the
command would expand to

    /repeat ... \
      /test fwrite(ftime("WWW/townsends/rod/logs/chest-%%Y-%%m-%%d",time()),\
        %%{*})

and then when the /repeat is executed, the /test command expands to

    /test fwrite(ftime("WWW/townsends/rod/logs/chest-%Y-%m-%d",time()), %{*})

and then the %{*} would get evaluated by the expression.  But a better
solution than either of those is just to use {*}.  In an expression, {*} is
the same as %{*} and %*.  And since it doesn't contain any % characters, you
don't have to worry about escaping them, no matter how deeply your
expression is nested in layers of macros or /repeats.

  /def -Fq -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ gets .* from the low level donation chest$' = \
    /repeat -0:00:02 1 \
      loom %1%%; \
      tell Johnn %P0%%; \
      tell Thalasian %P0%%; \
      tell Gisselle %P0%%; \
      /test fwrite(ftime("WWW/townsends/rod/logs/chest-%%%Y-%%%m-%%%d",time()),\
        {*})

BTW, I changed \%; to %%; because the latter is easier to use if you need
deeper nesting.  The chart below shows how the backslash form quickly gets
very unweildy as the nesting gets deeper:

depth:      0     1      2       3          4
backslash:  %;    \%;    \\\%;   \\\\\\\%;  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\%;
percent:    %;    %%;    %%%;    %%%%;      %%%%%;

Oops, I forgot about the /repeat.  Everything I said would be valid if
that /repeat was a second /def, but it's not.  The %* (or {*}) is only
defined within the macro, but the /repeat body doesn't execute until
later, so {*} is not defined.  In this case, I suspect you want the loom
and tells delayed by 2 seconds, but don't care if the fwrite() is delayed.
So the easiest solution is to take the fwrite out of the /repeat:

  /def -Fq -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ gets .* from the low level donation chest$' = \
    /repeat -0:00:02 1 \
      loom %1%%; \
      tell Johnn %P0%%; \
      tell Thalasian %P0%%; \
      tell Gisselle %P0%; \
    /test fwrite(ftime("WWW/townsends/rod/logs/chest-%%Y-%%m-%%d",time()), {*})

Note how the %; on the Gisselle line separates the /repeat from the /test
within the /def, whereas the %%; on the loom and other tell lines separate
lines within the /repeat.  Also note how I indented each line to indicate
its nesting level; this is ignored by tf, but makes it easier to read for
humans.

For the sake of discussion, or if you really do want the fwrite delayed,
you can use escape() or /escape to quote any " characters that may be in
the line:

  /def -Fq -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ gets .* from the low level donation chest$' = \
    /repeat -0:00:02 1 \
      loom %1%%; \
      tell Johnn %P0%%; \
      tell Thalasian %P0%%; \
      tell Gisselle %P0%%; \
      /test fwrite(ftime("WWW/townsends/rod/logs/chest-%%Y-%%m-%%d",time()), \
        "$[escape('"', {*})]")

or

  /def -Fq -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ gets .* from the low level donation chest$' = \
    /repeat -0:00:02 1 \
      loom %1%%; \
      tell Johnn %P0%%; \
      tell Thalasian %P0%%; \
      tell Gisselle %P0%%; \
      /test fwrite(ftime("WWW/townsends/rod/logs/chest-%%Y-%%m-%%d",time()), \
        "$(/escape " %{*})")

I'm having a little trouble getting tinyfugue to handle special
characters, like  or .  The MUD I'm playing on supports them, my mail
editor/reader supports them, but if I paste them to my shell they don't
show up, and they get munged in tinyfugue.

Anyone have any suggestions on how to get these to display correctly?

Thanks in advance,
Chris Hilts

You need a system that supports locales, and you need to set the LC_CTYPE
or LANG variables in tf (or in the environment before starting tf).
See "/help locale".

  Hello Jesse..

I think what you want to do is something like the following..

/def -F -i -mregexp -t'^([^ ]) arrives\.$' bowarriver = \
	bow $[tolower(P1)]

The first line grabs the name from a 'Newbie arrives.' line
and the second line sends the line 'bow newbie'..
It's untested, but it should work..

Good luck,

 Alexander Wolgast

The only reason i was delaying the tells was because for some reason if
someone trips the triggers 5+ times really quickly (within a second or
so) the server i run the TF on closes my connection and so i have to
reconnect... still havent figured out why its booting me i thought about
putting a random number in the time delay see if that actually makes any
difference, but i doubt it since the connection is closed as soon as
they trip the triggers.

It isn't usually the accoun TF is run from that is the problem, but the
mud you are attached to.

SMAUG has an input buffer limitation and TF can quite easilly send more
than a buffer full of information if triggered multiple times.

When you overflow the input beffer, the game disconnects your connection.

Rather than try using delays in this way, take a look at the 'FIFO'
package for TF. This put items into a queue and only sends them to the mud
one line at a time.

    I was just wondering, since TF uses RegExp, if there's a place, a site 
that I could go to to not only learn more about them, but to get some 
practice done.
    I guess I'm much to simple minded to catch it all myself; but it 
confuses me -- pretty much.

    Thanks.

Thanks for the pointer in the right direction - it took me a long time
to find the right information, and it was quite frustrating.  I got it
eventually though - LC_CTYPE has to be "en_US", apparently.

Thanks again.

I have been wondering on this for a few years, and the need has recently
come back to the surface. Is there a way, with /recall, to grap a pattern,
and echo that line, and the line following, to the screen? This is for
CrystalMUSH, where one line comes with your location, and the next line
is the result of that location. When doing search patterns, it is good
to be able to check the status of a location I have been to.

In the same vein, is there a way to grap a pattern and the line BEFORE?
Keeping the same examples, I want to look for a result and see where I
got it.

No, there is no (simple) way of getting contextual lines around the results
of a /recall.  You could do it with a wrapper macro, as you can get the
line numbers of a /recall result by using #.

However, a little bird has whispered to me that you can get an arbitrary
number of contextual lines around /recall results in the upcoming 5.0 release.

How do I keep tinyfugue from notifying me of redefines?  I've tried
overriding the REDEF hook, to test things:

/def -p20000000 -mglob -h'REDEF ' squelchhook = /echo blah

But what I get is the blah, along with the redefine message:

blah
% def: Redefined macro foo

When typing "/def foo=foo" in to tinyfugue.

Just use -ag in your /def to gag the redef message,
/def -ag -mglob -h'REDEF ' scuelchhook

Ok, here's my problem. I want to take a string with some directions in
it seperated
by whitespaces
	/set path=n e s sw se
and then walk in one direction, do something, and then walk in the next
direction.

I've scoured the 'Net and read help files, but I can't seem to find a simple
/def to send something to worlds - mostly MUSHes or MUXi - to unidle
characters every random amount of time. A simple @pemit would work, or what
have you. Most of the idle scripts I've seen I've tried and for some reason
don't work for me. 

Can anyone help?

/repeat -3000 120 /send -W @@

That will work with all worlds currently online.  To change it to work
with only a particular world, change the "-W" to "-w<worldname>".

hey,

this is what tf help says:
  /car <list>   - Echo first word.  (Same as /first).  
  /cdr <list>   - Echo all words after first.  (Same as /rest).  

so I don't know if yer trying to do an expbot :P but anyway
if you got a line to trigg on, this is pretty easy..
should be something like this:
/def gofirstdir = \
  /send $(/car %{path})%;\
  /set path=$(/cdr %{path)

haven't tested this.. there's also another way, useing while
and shift.. but I guess that's how /car and /cdr function works ;)

For string parsing in general, several good methods are /car and /cdr,
/shift, or regmatch() (if your separator is anything other than a space).
But for this specific problem, also take a look at "/help map".

Hello everyone!

  How do I get the speedwalk.tf file that comes with tf
to first check all the aliases set with /alias before
interpreting it as dirs?
If i set /alias en enter or something like that it gets
interpreted as east%;north not as enter.. And the some dirs
like ne(northeast) etc. also get sent that way so if i put
speedwalk on i have to type those long dirs to move.. I
modified the speedwalk file a bit to check if the arg is
ne,nw,se,sw etc and send text accordingly but I would think
there is a nicer solution..

thanks,
- Teemu

Added this trig tonight:

/def -i -mregexp -P0hCcyan -t'\(([-a-zA-Z,\ ]+)+\)' directions_lite

And tf froze twice in short succession afterwards, which I have never seen
happen in using it for 6 or so years. Any idea what is wrong with the above?

It probably just got very slow.  Two + operators applied to the same
subpattern like that is very expensive, and totally unnecessary.  Just
use one:

/def -mregexp -P0hCcyan -t'\(([-a-zA-Z,\ ]+)\)' directions_lite

I left the parens in, in case you want to have a trigger body that uses %P1.
But if you don't, you can omit the parens too.

just a little report.. I successfully built and can run tinyfugue 4.0s1
under MacOS X beta today. It requires a bit of work in the shell,
installation of developer tools (you can find out how to here:
<http://maximumlinux.com/content/news/2000/09/13/11335>) and the terminal
tool does not support ansi colors (during the build it couldn't find a few
libraries and hardcoded to vt100). But it does work..

Hi.

Is there a way to read files from directory in the same way as tf reads
tf-help file while i'm using /help command
For example i have a file named 'file1.txt'
This file contains such lines

&&one
this is sample text of one

&&two
this is sample text of two

&&three
this is sample text of three

...


I want to make such def that when i start it with argument one:
/start one
it will show me:
this is sample text of one
line on screen or let me to put this line for example to variable..

I want to make such steps: read file and then read line that starts with
some special heys (for ex. && or sth)

Twisted? Hope you'll understand..

K.

1.
Can i insert tabulation key using sth like bash and c++ \t sign ? ie.
/echo 1234\t1234
to as result has:
1234	1234
2.
When i use /quote command like this:
/quote -S /set variable1 !grep %{*} file.txt
I want to search something in file and found line change to tf
variable. It works fine unless the more lines compare to search
string. Then "variable1" is the same as LAST line that was comparing to
search string. How to get the other lines ?

It supports ANSI color if you fix the termcap entry for vt100 before you
compile.

Open up /usr/share/misc/termcap in your favorite text editor and find the
line that looks like this:

d0|vt100|vt100-am|vt100am|dec vt100:\

Add this line immediately after it:

    :pa#64:Co#8:Sf=\E[3%dm:Sb=\E[4%dm:op=\E[m:AF=\E[3%dm:AB=\E[4%dm:\

Then from /usr/share/misc, run 'cap_mkdb termcap' to bring the termcap.db up
to date.

I got this off an OS X mailing list that was archived on google and thought
I would share it here.  Don't ask me what it means.  :)

Enjoy!

I've tried , but can't seem to get tinyfugue to work properly with the
"overhead map" in EmlenMud (in particular, aturion.com:4444)

What the mud does, is display a map with a top down view, in the top section
of the display, and everything else goes on the bottom.
The mapping requires VT100 windowing AND character mode.

Any ideas?

Hi..

Can I make status line two lines (or more) high?
For example:

__World: Cave____(Log)___Hp: Rather Hurt___Mail: No Mail___Killed Mobs:45_
___Charge: Ready to Charge___Logged in: 2m 45s_______Time: 12:56__________


Thanks,

Kalreg.

I don't believe so. But you can make it wider if you're using an xterm (or
the like). I set my term to 90 chars wide and made a longer status line.

Only problem is if you forget to make a wider term and start tf it will give
you an error message.

 Sometimes I have an impression (same with my friends) that tf somehow works
 slower then usual telnet, mean you have greater lags and such  when you're
 using it than with clean telnet. Is there any way to solve it? If not why
is
 that?



                 Maro
 P.S. I'm working on some really cool server machine so I don't think it's a
 hardware problem or maybe, I dunno. Any suggestions?

Depending upon the Operating System, this speed degradation is more
noticeable than others.  You are however correct.  The physical connection
speed will appear to have higher latencies than a normal telnet session
will.  The problem becomes even more noticeable as you load up more and more
triggers.  Trigger handling itself introduces the visual lag.

The tradeoff is fairly nominal though.  If you are seeing measurably
different results, I would suggest that you closely examine your trigger
code for potential bottlenecks.

In my personal experience, for most uses, mglob matching is more efficient
than mregexp matching, but nowhere near as flexable.  The other problem I've
seen is that some users will actually run the same trigger in multiple
locations to handle different events but triggering on the same line. On the
lpmud I wiz on, I've seen mortals have 8 seperate triggers on the text 'You
killed *.' and set each one to -F fallthrough so it hits all 8.  This is a
significant performance hit when you do this on multiple cases.

That said, I have to come right out and say the TF on Linux/AXP is a dog
using mregexp's.  I personally think it's becuase the string handling
libraries are that bad on Linux AXP, but I would not put it past the idea
that GCC is heavily tweaked for x86 code generation.  In other words, how
much difference in performance you see may be more platform dependant than
you might first think.

You can sometimes get tf being slow if you have a lot of triggers
and stuff, especially if they are badly constructed.  Is this a
possibliity?

Hi!

I don't know whether or not this is the right place for this question,
but I might as well try.

I'm having trouble with the /repeat command in tf for win32, version
4.0s1 (with window exstensions). It just doesn't work. :) If I do
/repeat to start a timer, and watch it with /ps, it works just fine
until it's supposed to execute the macro for the first time, when it
instead just halts, saying "pending" in the /ps listing. And nothing
happens.

I did not have this problem with earlier versions, so I'm a bit puzzled.
Is anyone else having the same problem, or know of a solution? I'm on a
Windows NT 4.0 machine, if that can have anything to do with it.

Thanks in advance.
/Eric

   Yes, Windows TF does not support asynchronous commands (/repeat
without -S, /quote without -S). AFAIK, there is no way around it.

Hi, after 3-4 years a am getting back to mudding.
Lot's off stuffs especially my tf-macros were lost during the time.
However most things i remember but one :
1. how to create trigger with variable in the patern it is sth. like :
   /def -mglob -p100 -t"%target" target_macro=sth%;
   where %target is changed == trigger is changed also without new   
   call of /def.
   I know that i can overwrite this macro always when i change
   %target value but it is (in my opinion) not good kind of 
   programming.

Thanx for any info u can spare me.
JPD.

If you plan to update the watchfor.tf script, could you make it world
specific? The way it is now makes me have to BE in a world to have it work,
and that's annoying. :)

I've encountered a strange problem when running TinyFugue tf-40s1 on Mac OS X Beta.  When I accidentally hit the delete key, TF suspends itself and dumps me back into the shell!  Likewise, when I accidentally hit any function keys, TF suspends.

When I first was using TF, which I had compiled using the tools ripped from Darwin, I never noticed this problem.  After I had installed Apple's official developer kit for Mac OS X Beta and re-compiled TF, then the problem cropped up in full force.

I can't help wondering if this is some weirdness related to the shell or to Apple's compiler.  Can anyone offer any hints or suggestions?  I would be most grateful.

This is correct.  Trigger matching is by far the biggest per-line
performance hit in tf.  To confirm this, try temporarily turning off
%borg, %hilite, and %gag; if you notice less lag with these off,
triggers are indeed your problem.

This example can be optimized by replacing the 8 identical triggers with
a single trigger whose body does everything the original 8 bodies did.

/help patterns contains these hints:

    * For best speed, make the beginning of your patterns as specific as 
      possible.  
    * Do not use ".*" or "^.*" at the beginning of a regexp.  It is very 
      inefficient, and not needed.  Use %PL instead if you need to retrieve 
      the value of the left side.  
    * If a glob and regexp can do the same job, use the glob, it's usually 
      faster.  

Another thing you can do:  if you play multiple worlds and you have
triggers that are used only on one of those worlds, define those
triggers with -w<worldname>.  _You_ may know that the trigger will
never match in the other worlds, but unless you use -w<worldname>, tf
still has to test the trigger in every world.

Redefining the trigger macro is the only way to do it.  To make this easier,
write a helper macro:

    /def set_target = \
        /def -mglob -t"%1" target_macro = sth
or
    /def -mglob -p0 -t"<none>" target_macro = sth
    /def set_target = \
        /edit -p100 -t"%1" target_macro

Then use it like "/set_target Bob" or "/set_target Ralph".

Will multi-line regexp matching be supported in tf5? Something like:

"^Someone casts iron will\.$You feel protected\.$"

If not, can that be added to the wish list?

I mixed up the -c and -p options.  I should have said:

    /def set_target = \
        /def -mglob -p100 -t"%1" target_macro = sth
or
    /def -mglob -c0 -p100 -t"<none>" target_macro = sth
    /def set_target = \
        /edit -c100 -t"%1" target_macro

Hi.. I've been an avid user of tf for almost 3 years.. It's a very useful
program..

I've tried submitting a couple fo patches to it in the past, to enhance
color support.. Right now though, I have a problem.

Recent versions of xterm can be compiled with 256 color support. (16 base
colors, 6x6x6 colorcube, and 24 grayscales).

Among other things, my patches will support overriding colors, and
support for 256 color xterms. They've not been tested cross-platform,
but they work very nicely.

In addition, I believe that shortbuf is too short. I suspect that it's the
cause of several crashes I get when running /ps that I've reported.

I've also got several useful sets of macros.

If two colors match, in non-exclusive mode, it'll work. and there's full
support for 256 color xterms. I can now hilight in 256 colors.

Scott

I've a few ideas to incoming versions of TF

1. Multilined status bar. For example by setting status_line1, 
status_line2 etc

2. Arrays by Variable.
For example setting array /set array ({"black"},{"blue"},{"yellow"})
and reading variables from array: /eval /echo array[0]
It would give the same effect as /echo black. These variables
not only can be tekst by other variables too:
/set var 34
/set array (var,"text")
/echo array[0]

and effect: /echo 34


Hey, Ken, is that possible to implement in new TF ?

Kalreg.

Hiho hiho tinyfugue-fans!

I have 2 little questions:

1. Does anyone remember or has programmed any "GUI" for TF?
2. I read about a mapper for TF once (long ago though). Anyone
   can remamber that one? (Or has made an own mapper?)

I would appreciate any answer that could help. It would even
help, if one has an idea on an algorithm to produce such a
mapping tool.

Thanks in advance
 Ralf

I have a question about priority that relates to this topic:

If you have a macro that is priority 1, and another macro that is priority 
10, which will match "first"? Many of my macros are set "-F" that don't 
have to be, simply because I don't understand how priority works, and what 
numbers will match first.

On the MUSHes I play on, "places" code is common. I'd like to set up a 
macro that does partial matching on the prefix common to places poses and says.

However, the configuration isn't *quite* universal. The basic convention 
I've seen is that it start with something along the lines of "At the 
<placename>" or "At your <placename>". Then, there will either be a colon 
(:), or a comma (,), followed by whatever pose or say would be made.

Examples:

At the red couch, Jamra waves hello.
At your table: Jamra says hello.

The following macro does not properly catch all places prefixes. Any 
suggestions as to where I went wrong?

/def -P1xBCwhite -t'At (your|the)*[,:]' par_place1

The origional message included two gif images, a colortest and an example
of the 256 color syntax hilighting. The list rejected them. If you wish
to recieve them, please send me private email.

Mostly stuff for hilighting.... Stuff in parenthesis, single quotes, angle
quotes, double-quotes, brackets....... Normally, if you assign different
colors to the same spot with different macro's, stuff doesn't work.

For instance:

   You say "Yeah, I know what you mean. (And yes, I wish it was different)"


The stuff in the parenthesis matches BOTH the 'in quotes' rule and the 'in
parenthesis' rule. Thus, as TF isn't set up to reasonably handle
double-assigning colors--- it 'logically OR's' the attributes. This works
for flags, but fails for colors--- macro's of this type haven't been done.

My first patch to tf (from over 2 years ago) fixes this issue. The
maintainer of TF never replied to me. This fix let's me construct USEFUL
color syntax hilighting macros.

This more recent change extends my tf copy to now support the above, with
256 colors. (recent xterm's supports 256 colors when compiled with
appropriate options.) These colors may be used for foreground and
background.

I'm attaching gif's of a couple of outputs of it... The 256 color test in
the xterm, and my current colorations. These are essentially the same
macros I've had for the last two years. As I just went from 16 to 256
colors in the last 48 hours, I've been altering my color selections...  
And not always for the better. it's going to take a while to figure out
the best color scheme. The things to note are what happens with the
nesting. For example (foo "bar" baz)  compared to "foo (bar) baz".

Without my patch for overlapping covers, these macro's are mostly useless.
Without my patch for 256 colors, you cannot run my macro's as given. (They
are now using colors that a normal tf doesn't have.)



Here's an example of my macro's (about 20% of them):

; in ""
/eval /def -w${world_name} -p1009 -P1Crgb_522 -t'[.( ,](\\"[^\\"]*\\")' -F
-i INquotes1_${world_name}
/eval /def -w${world_name} -p1009 -P1Crgb_522 -t'[.( ,](\\"[^\\"]*)' -F -i
INquotes2_${world_name}
/eval /def -w${world_name} -p1009 -P1Crgb_522 -t'(\"[^\"]*\")\$' -F -i
INquotes3_${world_name}
; in <>
/eval /def -w${world_name} -p1003 -P1Cblue -t'((<<|<)[^<>]*(>>|>))' -F -i
INangle_${world_name}

; pages's -- incoming
;/def -p1009 -P1Ccyan -mregexp -t'^[^ ]* pages, (".*") to you.*' -F -i 
/def -p1019 -aCcyan -aCbg_rgb_101 -mregexp -t'[^ ]* pages, ".*" to you' -F
-i page1
/def -p1019 -aCcyan -aCbg_rgb_101 -mregexp -t'[^ ]* pages: ' -F -i page2
/def -p1019 -PCcyan -aCbg_rgb_101 -mregexp -t'^In a page-pose to .*' -F -i
page3


If the same color is assigned to the same location, the 'last' one (or
lowest priorty) gets it.. Thus, these will hilight with the following
priorties: 
  #1 Highlight pages foreground cyan, background a dark purple
  #2 Highlight stuff in quotes with fg=pink
  #3 Highlight stuff in angle brackets fg=blue.

Where later lines override earlier lines, as far as color goes.


Overall, the system is *WONDERFUL* It's amazing how powerful and flexible
it is. And how much it helps with reading what's going on. As things are
now, there's no way I can go back to a system that doesn't hilight
everything I say/do, everything in quotes, everything in whispers,
everything in pages. I hope that that one gif gives you an idea.


Now, what macro's do you have? And where might I find them... And how
might they be extended with this? :)



Scott

Oh, a lot of my stuff's like that.  Thanks for the sharing.

Yeah, that annoys me.  It tries to mix the colour or something
funky when I'd much prefer it to just use the last-assigned
colour ('cause then I can control it by assigning priorities to
the macros).

Is this on the web somewhere?  Or could you email it to me?  I'd
love to see this as an option (even a compile-time option) in
5.0.  Ken K, are you listening here??

I don't use xterms, I use text mode.  So the 256 colour thing
wouldn't work for me.

Makes sense.  I like the syntax of how you've done the 256 colour
stuff too, it's sane. :)

Yup.  Here's something similar I have (I haven't got -mregexp
because I have that set as the default) (oh, and pages etc, the
sytem-message bit of it, are all green):

; Pages etc.
/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush" -F -P2BCyellow -t'^(You) say ' TINY.MUSHsay
/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush" -F -P1Cgreen -t'^[A-Za-z\.-]* ?[A-Za-z\.-]* (senses) ' TINY.MUSHsense
/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush" -F -P1Cgreen -t'^[A-Za-z\.-]* ?[A-Za-z\.-]* (whispers?) "' TINY.MUSHwhisp
/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush" -P1Cgreen -t'^[A-Za-z\.0-9-]* ?[A-Za-z\.-]* (pages( to )?).*:' TINY.MUSHpage
/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush" -F -PCgreen -t'Long distance to ' TINY.MUSHlongdist
/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush" -PCgreen -t'^Announcement: ' TINY.MUSHannounce

/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush" -PCgreen -t'^You whisper' TINY.MUSHselfwhis
/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush" -PCgreen -t'^You paged' TINY.MUSHselfpage

/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush" -F -PCgreen -t'^(At|On|From|Over|In|Across|Within) [A-Za-z -]*,?,' TINY.MUSHplaces

Noticy the -T setting.  I have a set for tiny.mush's, a set for
MOO, a set for MUD, etc.  Plus specific ones for each world which
highlight people's names and system-specific messages.

Be happy to share the lot if you like, but it's probably stuff
that does the same as what yours does, except set out the way I
like it :)

Yup.  I have trouble reading due to some cognitive difficulties
and there's NO way I can understand pages full of text that
aren't highlighted in some way.  TF's highlighting, I highlight
stuff I say and do and pages and whispers etc in colour, also
people's names in different colours, system messages are one
colour, errors all one colour, etc etc.  For example:

Background for eveything: black
Standard foreground: non-bright white
System messages: dark blue (intentionally a darkish colour
because they're stuff I can ignore)
Errors: bright red
Page/Whisper/etc as above: dark green
My name/"You"/etc., stuff I do: bright yellow
People who I know somewhat: bright white
Other colours are all people's names, eg I have for tiny.mush a
macro like this:

/def -p500 -F -T"tiny.mush.keon" nKEON = \
   /def -p100 -T"tiny.mush.keon" -F -P2%{2} -t'^(From [a-zA-Z ]*,|At your [^,]*,|You sense|You paged|Long distance to|\\(|\\[.*\\])? ? ?(%{1}(\\'s)?)([, \:\\(]|\$)' KEON%{1}

That's for the world "keon", BTW.  Then I go, for people I'm
tracking:

/nKEON Kieran BCgreen
/nKEON Ken(net)? BCgreen
/nKEON Debs BCcyan
/nKEON Jenn Cmagenta
/nKEON Dancer Cyellow
/nKEON Rich BCcyan
/nKEON Scott BCblue

Like this.  Makes adding new people with new colours much easier.

With this arrangement I get a page that's probably about  70%
regular colour (non-bright white) with blobs of brighter colour
for stuff I need to pay attention to me.

Is this making sense?

What do you mean, aside from /visual?  If you want multiple
windows, just start multiple instances of TF in different xterms
or whatever your system allows.

If you want millions of buttons and stuff, tf probably isn't
what you're looking for.

If you're using regexp matching, you missed a '.'. (woo, today's
topic:  fun with punctuation).  Try this:

/def -P1xBCwhite -t'At (your|the) .*[,:]' par_place1

Using regexp matching, is there a significant speed difference
between 5 fallthrough macros matching with these patterns:

'foobar'
'foobaz'
'foobax'
'fooquux'
'fooquuux'

and 1 macro matching with this:

'foo(bar|baz|bax|quux|quuux)'

?

These are, obviously, just examples.  I guess the overall
question is are a bunch of simple matches slower or faster than
one single complex match, assuming that they're just highlighting
stuff so their body is empty.

That is the correct way to write Gwen's original pattern.  But the -P1 should
be -P0, since you want to hilite the whole prefix, not the word 'your' or
'the'.

However, it still has the problem that it may match too much, since it matches
to the LAST comma or colon, e.g.

  At the bar, Joe winks, and smiles.

will be hilited up to and including "winks,".  To only match up to the FIRST
comma or colon, use:

  /def -P0xBCwhite -t'^At (your|the) [^,:]*[,:]' par_place1

There is nothing against some buttons...I have some hundreds of
marcos and even more trigger. And as you can see, the namespace
for handy and rememberable macronmes is slowly getting too small
and since I'm not too good at typing, I'd like some buttons to
start some of the usefull macros. And it would be nice to display
some things in a separate window (status line is not wide enough
for all the things I would like to see all the time)

Quoting Ralf Narozny <rnarozny@web.de>:

I believe there is a Gnome GUI wrapper for TF called Crescendo, though
I no longer know where to find it.  For Linux/Unix only, of course.
Freshmeat.net lists it at http://freshmeat.net/search/?q=Crescendo


> Some years ago someone made a Tcl/Tk GUI for TF. I wanted this one

I don't know of any TCL/Tk wrappers for TF itself.  The closest thing
I can think of is Trebuchet <http://www.belfry.com/fuzzball/trebuchet/>
which is written completely in TCL/Tk, but it was only inspired by TF.
It isn't macro compatible with TF, unfortunately.  It does often use
similar commands, though.  Just enough to confuse.  *heh*

Mine's done that right for the last 3 years.. I submitted the patch around
tf40a3 or so, with no response. The problem below is the 'old | new' when
it's applying attributes. You can 'a|b' flags OK, but you can't 'a|b' the
bit's when they're representing colors.

I'd attach the patch for you to apply, but alas, this (^%#^%$#) mailing
list doesn't support attachments. I'll cut&paste it. It probably
won't apply cleanly, but it will give you an idea.

He's never EVER responded to me, to the few emails I've sent over the last
couple years. BTW, there are some problems with shortbuf being too short..
I've gotten problems running /ps and getting segfaults. I would advise
making it longer. Memory is a lot cheaper now. 

The patch I'm appending now is from around a year ago when I upgraded my
overlapping color patch to 40s1. It does not include my 256 color support
or other fixes. It is NOT a diff to my current codebase.

BTW, if someone has a good website they would like to donate to this, I
can put up my full codebase and xterm binary, and my full macro set..
Complete with a half-dozen guest-worlds. :)

Good suggestion.. I should rig my stuff up that way too... My current
scheme is that I essentially never run more than one world in one tf
session. Thus, I include only the files for the world. (The 'default' one,
and the generic muck's one.) I run most of my macros in an 'eval', and
substitute the current world in:

/eval /def -w${world_name} -p1020 -aCgreen -aCbggray5 -mglob
-t'{You|You\\'re}*' -F -i you_name_line_${world_name}

I can understand the text, I just find the coloration makes things MUCH

SWEET!! I've got something sorta similar:

/def hi = /def -p500 -w${world_name} -PCrgb_520 -t%1 -F -i
hi_${world_name}_%1_them %; /def -p530 -w${world_name} -aCbggray4 -mregexp -t"%1" -F -i
hi_${world_name}_%1_line

/hi foo
/hi bar
/hi PlayerX

Essentially the same, except that I am not giving individual users
different colors. My world definition files:


-- worldfoo --
/load Default
/load Mucks-1

/hi foo
/hi bar
/hi baz

--- file end ---

This way, I only load what I need to for the specific world, and I don't
have a seperate hilight macro like yours for each world...

Anybody know why?

When I started donating my tf packages around, I put them on my own
account. I collected only a few macro packages by other people mostly
regarding the german MUD Morgengrauen.

If anyone likes to share his stuff I will include it :)

Just send it to me with a short description.

Have Fun

just wanted to give me my point of view as there's lots of rumours
of this tf 5;

I'm missing the function of having a 2 lined visual field, and 
the lack of having darker colors if you got a standard bright
color. I don't want to sound like a whiner, I love tf :)

Ok, I'm kind of new to programing TF, so this may seem weird...

I am on a mud that has vampires... The only way to heal yourself is
it regen and drink blood occasionally.... 

What I was wanting to create was a macro that I could call with say
rg, and then it would regen me until I was fully healed and drink
blood when necessary... 

I was concidering using a /while statement in it that would look for
the "Your body slowly regenerates itself." message that the mud sends
and then call the rg thing again... 

Is this possible to do, or am I approaching it from the wrong angle?

Triggers that call them selves is quite easy once you've done it
actually I found that to be the best way to say read a list
like a 'who' list or something, as long as there is something
special at the end that can cancle the trigger.

So in your case you could make a macro that defines
a trigger to look for 'your body..', if you use a while
statement TF will freeze up during the while statement
so this would be bad :)
Then you could create another trigger as a one shot trigger
to look for when you stop regenerating, if this is possible
for on the mud you play on.

Dont ask me why but I want to use Windows telnet and
connect to a unix machine where I have tinyfugue
installed.

I want to know how to make tf give me more lines --
what is the correct syntax to set the number of lines
visible to 60 (say?) I know I have to put it in my
.tfrc file, and I can manually resize the telnet
window, but it still thinks its 80 X 25...

Please help

It's not a tf problem but a terminal problem..

What I do to make sure my unix shell (solaris and tcsh) understands the
size of the screen is this:

alias rows 'setenv LINES \!*; /bin/stty rows \!* cols 80'
/usr/openwin/bin/resize; rows 60; /usr/openwin/bin/resize; tf

Hi..

  I've done similar things a while back. That was built on me getting
diffrent messages when I healed myself if I was hurt or if I was all OK..

  I found it useful to do things like this

metacode:

1. Heal myself

2. Check the return. All ok ? No, goto 1

3. All done. :)

In tf code this looks something like: 

/alias  fixme   \
# Define an alias for it all..
# /alias is a local extension I have that just defines it all as a hook..
#
# First I define a trigger on the action that heals myself
                /def -F -i -t'You utter a quick prayer\.' loc_trig_fixme_prayer = \
# Ok.. I am healing myself.. Setting up a one-shot trigger that goes again when
# either the heal goes through or I fail.
                        /def -F -n1 -i -mregexp -t"(You feel healing energy surge through you\.|Somehow you get the impression that Sek's attention has gone elsewhere\\.)" \
                                loc_trig_fixme_heal = \
                                        clw string %; \
# Setting a one-shot trigger for when I'm all healed up..
                /def -F -n1 -i -t'You are not in need of healing\.' loc_trig_fixme_remove = \
                        /echo -aCyellow -- ---> I feel fine.. %%; \
                        /undef loc_trig_fixme_prayer %%; \
                        /undef loc_trig_fixme_remove2 %; \
# And a one-shot for when I'm all healed up..
                /def -F -n1 -i -t'You do not have enough guild points to cast cure light wounds; it will cost you 20\.' loc_trig_fixme_remove2 = \
                        /echo -aCyellow -- ---> D'oh! Not enough energy.. %%; \
                        /undef loc_trig_fixme_prayer %%; \
                        /undef loc_trig_fixme_remove %; \
                clw $me

So in essence what we do is defining a macro that can see if we
are ok after a heal and if not heals us again, if we are undefines 
itself. And then just start it all by healing us one time.


  This got a little more complicated that I hoped it would be. If you
got any questions don't hesitate to ask..

Actually, you want to set the cols and rows before starting TF.

a command like:

  stty rows 24 cols 80

on the command line in the shell should do pretty much as you would
expect.  Change the numbers as is appropriate for what you want to do. 
Then start something that requires that setting for display purposes. 
My choice is Pine, because I always check my mail first thing when I
log onto the shell.  Pine will tell your telnet client what is expected
of it, then you can just quit out of it if you don't want to check
mail, and then get on with TF which will now operate in the constraints
of what Pine just told it to do.

However, I have MUCH experience in this, having to do exactly this
quite often when using other people's boxen.  I highly recommend you go
to http://www.vandyke.com/ and get CRT or SecureCRT.  Worth every
penny.  If the world you're connecting to has anything beyond straight
text, you are playing russian roulette with your display sanity with
Windows telnet.  It just doesn't have it.  CRT hasn't burped on a
single thing I have thrown at it.  If you need SSH capability,
SecureCRT is king.

I would certainly second the recommendation for CRT/SecureCRT, it is
a fine product and I use it every day.

However, if someone wants a free, small and virtually undetectable (in
case the problem is grumpy sysadmins who dislike third-party software)
telnet client for Windows that even has color support, I'd like to suggest
a visit to:

http://www.klever.net/kin/

There is an application there called Kinsole that runs in the DOS
window/command prompt in Windows and it's a great way to get a telnet app
that isn't QUITE as brain dead as the built-in one you get with
Windows.

You just open a command prompt, type "mode con lines=50" to get the size
to be more useful and run kinsole like you would telnet.

Regards,
	Kimmo

Yep :). The pre-compiled binary is at:

http://www.druware.com/tf/

I would suggest a slightly older version of a druware compile, if you 
can't/don't compile it yourself.

http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/1579/download/tf40g1.zip

tf40s1, which is at the druware site now, has really bad typing delays. 
Some sort of buggy thing that he didn't get the time to fix, last I'd 
heard. tf40g1 is pretty clean as far as how it runs.

Hi all,

Could someone please help me with how to construct at simple trigger in
tf.
Like, when the MUD says 'You are hungry' I want the client to respond
with the command eat bread.
Please include examples using both /trig and /def -t

Also, /bind is not clear to me....

/Fredrik

2. Arrays by Variable. 
For example setting array /set array ({"black"},{"blue"},{"yellow"})

/def -mregexp -F -t'You are hungry' hungry = /send eat bread

What this does is defines a trigger with a name called Hungry
It uses the /send command to send a command to the mud 'eat breat'

-mregexp means regular expression, I find this easiest to use.

To get rid of the trigger do /undef hungry
The -F means fall thru which means that if you create other triggers look
for the same
words or more they'll be able to catch it.

The /trig is a macro that uses /def -t same thing.

This is what I'm trying to do. Im creating a new charecter on a mud, and its
rolling for my stats. And instead of sitting here for hours trying to get a
good roll I would like to make a macro/trigger. So when I issue /stats it
will keep rolling until it matches the criteria I have set. Then it will sit
there and wait for me to type y and approve it. Here is what I have so far...

/def stats = \
    /set s=0 %; \
    /while (s < {4}) \
	set s=0 \
        /def -t"*ox*" stat_trigger = s=s+1\
        /def -t"*cat*" stat_trigger = s=s+1\
        /def -t"*elm*" stat_trigger = s=s+1\
        /def -t"*sage*" stat_trigger = s=s+1\
        /def -t"*horse*" stat_trigger = s=s+1\
        /def -t"*religion*" stat_trigger = s=s+1 \
        /if /test (s < {4})%; /then /send n%; /elseif /done%; /endif

This is the error I am getting...

% stats: unexpected /THEN in DO block

This is the first trigger I have ever written what am I doing wrong?

It's really confusing the way you wrote it in syntax i'll just rewrite it here.

/def stats = \
  /set s 0%;\
  /def -mregexp -F -t"*ox*" stat_trigger1 = /stats2%;\
  /def -mregexp -F -t"*cat*" stat_trigger2 = /stats2%;\
  /def -mregexp -F -t"*elm*" stat_trigger3 = /stats2%;\
  /def -mregexp -F -t"*sage*" stat_trigger4 = /stats2%;\
  /def -mregexp -F -t"*horse*" stat_trigger5 = /stats2%;\
  /def -mregexp -F -t"*religion*" stat_trigger6  = /stats2%;\

/def stats2 = \
  /test s := s + 1%;\
  /if (s < 4) \
    /send n%;\
  /ELSE
     /undef stat_trigger1%;\
     /undef stat_trigger2%;\
     /undef stat_trigger3%;\
     /undef stat_trigger4%;\
     /undef stat_trigger5%;\
     /undef stat_trigger6%;\
  /ENDIF

When ever you want to make something that is going to loop and needs input from
the mud you can't do a while statement, because when a while statement or any
other loop or macro is currently running it can't read data from the mud, so you
have
to make triggers to read the data from the mud.  I not sure what code is trying
to do
but this rewrite should help you.

Since TinyFugue is already locale-aware, would it be much of a trouble
to make it capable of handling UTF-8 as well.

Output needs just to pass it through and probably use 'wcwidth()' for
wrapping, although it isn't entirely necessary.

Input needs to do a little more, basically just pass through the
characters but ignore characters of the binary form 10xxxxxx while
backspacing / counting character positions etc.

Anyway - with the advent of new the UTF-8 capable xterm, I am already
in need of this feature - and it would be just plain cool as well.

So this is a wish for TF5.0, whenever it's coming :)

Hi all,

Got another quest ion for you:

Is there a way to get tf to do a command x number of times.
I used SMM before and that client had the #<number> <command> 
feature.. Practical for fast movement..

How could I do such a command?

/Fredrik

Well, hm. '/repeat -0 10 north' would make you run 'north' 10 times
with no delay at all. But I guess you want this for speedwalk?
Try /require speedwalk.tf and then enable speedwalk by typing
/speedwalk . Then you can use 10n for running 10 north.

Thanks all!

This for me demonstrates why I should stick with tf:
One question gave three different working answers.

/def gw = grab weapon
/def g1 = /repeat -0:0:1 10 /gw

/def ga = grab armour
/def g2 = /repeat -0:0:1 10 /ga


both of these work well, but i can't figure out how to compact it down to
one command.  is it possible to send "grab weapon" wait one sec, send
"grab armour", wait one sec, repeat?

thanks,

Jesse

As Frank asked this question I also want to contribute a little thing:

/def n = /let n=$[{1}+1]%;/while (--n>0) /eval %-1%; /done%;

This one has the advantage of not using repeat, therefore not spawning a
new process, it can also execute macros. And most importang you can use
the counter in the things you do.

E.g:

/n 5 take all from corpse %n

takes all from the corpses 1 to 5

or even further

/n 3 wear ring %n%;cast fireball%;unwear ring %n%;

cycles through 3 rings 
wearing them 
then casting a fireball using the ring and
unwearing them

Have Fun,

it only works that simple for one action
for multiple you have to take into account the time elapsed

simple action:

/def x=\
   wear ring %;\
   /repeat -1 1 cast fireball%%;\
   /repeat -1 1 unwear ring

/x does it

for multiple actions

you have to add a call to itself to the macro

/def x = \
  wear ring%;\
  /repeat -5 1 cast fireball%%;\
  /repeat -5 1 unwear ring%%%;\
  /repeat -5 1 /x

like all recursion a break condition would be fine

/set x=0

/def x = \
  /if (!x) /return%; /endif%;\
  wear ring%;\
  /repeat -5 1 cast fireball%%;\ 
  /repeat -5 1 unwear ring%%%;\
  /repeat -5 1 /x

setting x to 1 and calling /x would repeat the actions until x is set to 0

I'm using the Druware precompiled binaries of TinyFugue 4.0 stable 1 on a
Windows 2000 platform.  I've tried using the /repeat command in various
forms and allways get the same result, the process waits until the first
expected execution (listing the time delay in the /ps output), but then
immediately switches to a pending status.

For example:

/repeat -0:0:5 5 tell naked hello this repeat is now working
/repeat -2 5 /echo IT WORKS!

both display something similar to the below if /ps is run before the first
interval expires:

  PID     NEXT TYPE   DISP WORLD       PTIME COUNT COMMAND
    1  0:00:03 repeat                0:00:05     5 tell naked hello this
repeat is now working

however, as soon as the interval expires, /ps shows...

  PID     NEXT TYPE   DISP WORLD       PTIME COUNT COMMAND
    1  pending repeat                0:00:05     5 tell naked hello this
repeat is now working

I have lp=on and lpquote=off (as i'm on an lp style mud, and i do want the
processes to run on a timed basis rather than on a returned prompt basis).

Any advice would be much appreciated (also, if I need to provide any further
information just ask).

James Spinks

(I am also aware of the 'unofficial' nature of this binary)

thanks for the help.  

/def x=\
        /repeat -2 10 say one %;\
        /repeat -2 10 say two %%;\
        /repeat -2 10 say three

this is close to what i need, but i need to create a one second delay
somehow. like:

/def x=\
	;one second delay
        /repeat -2 10 say one %;\
	;one second delay
        /repeat -2 10 say two %%;\
	;one second delay
        /repeat -2 10 say three

is there a delay command?

thanks,

Jesse

why do you repeat those things ten times ??

Isn't that what you want?

is there a delay command? no

you may freeze your tf for one second by using a construction like this

/let freeze_time=1%;\
/let start_time=$[time()]%;\
/while (time()-start_time<freeze_time) /done%;

but this is not suggestet as it holds your tf completely generating lots
of cpu usage (e.g. 100%)

another possibility of waiting x seconds is to issue a sleep command to
the shell
/sys sleep x

but with both versions you halt your tf causing no input from the mud or
yourself to be processed etc.

what i have, and i think it will work without "growing", is:


/def x                                  =       /repeat -2 3/xx

/def xx=\
        /repeat -2 1 say one %;\
        /repeat -2 1 say two %%;\
        /repeat -2 1 say three

so i enter "/x" and then i can do these actions, which will have a two
second delay between them? and i will "say one" three times?
it seems to work and do what what i want, i think. :)

/def cc         =       say two
/def c          =       /repeat -6 40 /cc

as near as i can figure, this is the only thing that seems to work. if the
commands come too "fast and furious" they get rejected, so the must be
spaced out. and diff commands have diff periods. and then, also, "say
one" and "say two" must seperated by a few seconds.  so what seems to work
is two diff repeats that run concurently for a relatively long time, then
i use the "kill process" to end them. 

i tinkered with the "sleep" but didn't seem to hit on the right solution.

by manually entering /c and /s that seems to work, but can i use the sleep
command to put them together?

thanks,

Jesse

This is a bug.....   a rather nasty one I might add.  It's fixed in the
newer builds I'm testing for deployment now.  I finally got the new
installer working and should have it all ready to go in the next couple of
weeks.

  I've read through most of the answers so far and much of it seems
a little too complex and missing an important point..

The following:

/def x = \
	/repeat -1 1 say one %; \
	/repeat -1 1 say two

does NOT cause the two commands to be sent with a seconds delay.
What it does is mearly putting two commands in the process list to
be executed in one second.

It is possible to do the following:

/def gwa = grab weapon %; /repeat -1 1 grab armour

/def doit = /repeat -2 10 /gwa


This will cause gwa to be repeated 10 times with a two second
delay. gwa will then in its turn first send 'grab weapon' and then
sending 'grab armour' one second later.


  If you are on a mud that can't handle too fast input from
you it should be quite possible to get tf to send all lines a
second apart automatically..

Just making this up as I go, try this on for size:

; We need some variables
/set currpos=1
/set endpos=1

; And we need to grab all that is trying to be sent to the world.

/def -p1 -hSEND grabit = \
	/eval /set fifo_%{endpos}=%* %; \
	/set endpos=$[endpos + 1]

; Okay.. Here I'm hoping that we grab each line and save them to
; variables named fifo_1, fifo_2, etc.. 

; Now that they are saved we also need to send them..

/def sendline = \
	/eval /send \%fifo_%{currpos} %; \
	/eval /unset fifo_%{currpos} %; \
	/set currpos=$[currpos + 1]


/def checksend = \
	/if (currpos != endpos) \
		/sendline %%; \
	/endif %; \
	/if (currpos == endpos) \
		/set currpos=1 %%; \
		/set endpos=1 %%; \
	/endif

; Okay.. Here we start it all..
; 0:0:1 for once every second and 84600 repeats enough for 24h.
/repeat -0:0:1 84600 /checksend

This should do it.. To explain it somewhat grabit takes every line being sent
to the world and saves it into variables like fifo_1, fifo_2, etc.. Every
second we call checksend which checkes if we have any unsent lines. If there
are any we call sendline which sends one line (with /send so we don't grab
it again) and undefines it (so we don't eat up too much memory).
Back in checksend we check if the queue is empty. If it is we set our
counters back to 1 so our counters stay sane..

  Once again, this is untested code and especially the /eval lines might
need more escapes, but other than that I can't see why this shouldn't work.

  If it is possible to set a priority to 0 instead of 1 (as I have done
in defining grabit), that should be an improvment and help with possible
conficts arising from other send hooks with default priority. 

  Oh well..

Hi,
After reading all answer for "repeat actions" subject i find out that every1
missed 1 another possibility of fixing that problem : using (choose 1)
methods of nice variable structure as arrays or stack.
cos stask is implemented in tf.lib i dont want to describe it but only
1 thing : you can use action-by-variable :

/def makro1=(make something)
/set act_var=makro1

/eval /%act_var - will activate makro1.
after such a definition u can use stack to store different values of act_var
and pop them every repeat.
Disadvatage of above method is : the stack after all pops is empty and
all macro_names are lost.
So U can avid that by using 2nd stack to push macro_name afer
poping it from the first one and when first stack is empty swich stacks.
If its necesary to do commands in this same order u must not just switch
stack_names but create macro which will "pop st2"  "push st2" desired
times to re_push first stack.
Remember that the stack is structure of LIFO kind.

This problem does not exist when u use "array_like" structure.

Using "arrays" is slight different - there is no real structure of array but
u can create somrthing like that :

/def ga=get armour
/def gb=get ball
etc.
/set  array1=ga
/set  array2=gb
etc.

/set arr_ndx=1
/eval /set call_macro=array%arr_ndx
/eval /%call_macro             - will call ga

/set arr_ndx=2
/eval /set call_macro=array%arr_ndx
/eval /%call_macro             - will call gb

"array" in above /eval /set line can be just word not a varaible; if "array"
additionally is a variable (to use different arrays in this same method,
macros set etc) you shall use :

/eval /set call_macro=%array%arr_ndx

the result of that will be the string which contains
value_of_array+value_of_arr_ndx.
I am using above method adn works perfecly !!
And it has 1 advantage - is verry flexible.
Every1 who is familliar to programing in C(C++) or in another structural
comp-language can see the advantage
of such a method instead of creating tonns of actions which doing almost
exactly this same.


Going this way far u can try to use functions of strings as strcat() etc.
builded in tf to create more and more sophisticated macros as u desire.

Try to experiment with all i wrote above - u can see the results would be
great.



Aha, in repeat statement use just 21 call to the macro which do all the
implemented things.

/repeat -1 10 /call_macro

and include all desired commands (as index increasing; ifs statement;
calling macros; sending commans to the mud, etc.) within /def call_macro.
It's much more clear and easier to fix, than using tons of "%" sign in 1
damn long and not readable /repeat statement.

Nice Idea :)

would be a kind of interpreter within an interpreter :))

you could store procedures without defining macros, great for newbies or
non-programmers

Btw. I have written such an array like structure you mentioned with
functions for getting and setting the values, and functions iterating over
all values and doing something with them

Ah..  My mistake.. I should have looked closer, although I would
recommend to indent it better.

/def x = \
	/repeat -1 1 say one %%; \
		/repeat -1 1 say two

or even

/def x = \
	/repeat -1 1 \
		say one %%; \
		/repeat -1 1 say two

:)

  Probably environmental damage on my part..

/def x = /if (1) /test y("abc")%; /endif%;
/def y = /result {1}%; /while (0) /done%;

/set pedantic=on
/x
produces the following warning:
% y: warning: non-numeric string value used in numeric context

As I want to share my macro packages with other people, setting pedantic
to off is not an option.

The most curious thing about this is that removing either the /if
statement in /x or the /while loop in /y also remove the warning, although
they have nothing to do with the code semantics!!

I am in urgent need for help as this seems to be one of the last bugs of
my actual project which I want to share with my friends.

Thanx,

Michael (mesirii@mg.mud.de)


Btw. It only took me 3 hours to extract the problem from a more complex
source. I never thought about the /if or /while generating the problem
:(((((

Ok my guess is that return when you're doing something like return {*}
which is returning what you're passing to it is making the macro default
as a numeric function only.  Anyways to make this work all I did was change
function y the new function to make it work is as follows:

/def x = /if (1) /test y("abc")%; /endif%;
/def y = /test yy := {1}%; /result yy%; /while (0) /done

By the way you don't have to use %; at the end of a macro or function
Why you use pedantic=on is beyond me, turn it off is easier since
you can switch between text and numeric without problems.

see above, did you perhaps switch pedantic off meanwhile?

I know, but when adding lines to a macro I don't want do care about
missing %; sometimes I even end macros with %;\ and a empty line :)

The thing is about sharing, there are many people who want pedantic
pointing to possible failures. It also helped me a lot with debugging.

I append the original macro so that you can see the real use of the thing.
By the way I think that the structure of: 
1. macro x calling macro y by /test within an /if statement
2. macro y by returning something (any string), followed by a while loop 

does produce the warning!

Even that works: 
/def x = /if (1) /test y()%; /endif%;
/def y = /result "abc"%;/while (0) /done%;


now the original:

/hcreatelist kmx_namekuerzen

/def kmx_namekuerzen=\
    /if ((0+{1})==0) /reBsult ""%; /endif%;\
    /if ({-1}=~"" | (0+{1})>=strlen({-1})) \
;!!!!!! the error occurs here
       /result {-1}%; \
    /endif%;\
    /test hgetvalueof("kmx_namekuerzen",{*})%;\
    /if (value!~error) \
;!!!!!!and here
       /result value%; 
    /endif%;\
;/echo *%1* *%-1*%;\

The code I test worked under 4.0 gamma 1.
But you're limiting your self by having this pedantic on though.  I have written
over
1000 lines of TF macro code pretty advanced stuff, and it all works just fine.

If you don't have 4.0 gamma 1 then upgrade to it :)
Also code looks better if done on seperate lines easier to read so for example.
/def y = /test res := {1}%;\
             /result res%;\
             /while (0) \
             /done

Course the while statement will never execute since result makes the function
return at that line. And I had pedantic on as well.  If 5.0 ever comes out
maybe macro coding will be easier, think Kenkeys has been working on it
for over 2 years now :)

No, as I already stressed, there are lots of people who want to live with
the safety of /set pedantic=on :)

By the way, I wrote about 15 000 lines of tf-code in the last years and
most of them work fine with pedantic on :)

I have alread upgraded to 4s1 almost a year ago :) downgrading to 4g1
should not solve the problem.

you are right, but when testing within tf all linebreaks are removed, and
as I tried some hours to find the simplest example producing the bug, I
just copied the code from tf.

I stopped dreaming of tf5.0 :)

why does

not show the gagged lines ?

/recall -ag

and 
/recall -w -l -ag

neither one shows both :(

What is the most efficient way to create and actually run trigger
hierarchies?

1. Setting variables and testing them by -E()
2. defining, undefining triggers as needed
3. modifying the chance flag of triggers 
4. ?????

How can I forward a call to a function with a variable parameter list ?

Imaging you have a function that can be used with 1-10 parameters.
(like pad for example)

How can I write another function that calls the first one and supplies
all of its parameters? 

e.g it could add an additional pair to the call of pad

/def x = /return pad("prefix",15,{*})

unfortunately {*} does not work, as it connects all parameters to a single
string value

the only other way I can imagine is doing a while loop over all parameters
and constructring the call of pad as an string which is then executed
using /eval. But this seems quite weird for the simple thing I want to
achieve.

Ideas are welcome?

How about
/def x = /return pad("prefix",15, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}, {9})

As far as I know functions are limited to 9 parameters, and the empty string
should be passed for any parameters that weren't given to X.

This would work, but it's ugly and innefficient.

There is no explicit limit on the number of parameters to a function,
but otherwise Karen is correct; this is the easiest method.  In the
definition of /x, you need to list as many parameters as you're ever
going to use when calling /x.

By "trigger hierarchy", I'm assuming you mean trigger 1 enables trigger 2,
which enables trigger 3, etc, so you can match a sequence of lines.

When a line is tested against a trigger macro in tf, the components of the
macro are tested in this order:
    macro could have an effect (see below)
    macro world == current world (-w)
    macro worldtype matches current worldtype (-T)
    expression != 0 (-E)
    trigger pattern matches line (-t)
These are intentionally arranged so that the faster tests are first, so
if they fail, the slower tests can be avoided.

The first test above is whether the macro could have any effect if it were
to match.  That is:
    %borg is on and macro probability > 0 and macro has a body; OR
    %hilite is on and macro has display attributes; OR
    %gag is on and macro is a gag

There is actually a bug in the effectiveness test.  A macro should also
be considered potentially effective if it is not a fallthru (-F), since
a matching non-fallthru (even with -c0) should block lower priority
triggers.  This bug may be fixed in 5.0.

So the most efficient way to disable a fallthru trigger without deleting
it is to set its probability to 0.  A simple expression (such as -Eflag)
is next, and will work for non-fallthrus even if the above bug is fixed.
(And expressions will be more efficient in 5.0.)

But even the most efficient failing match has some overhead.  And in
the typical case, line 1 of the sequence is relatively rare compared to
the number of other lines you receive from the server.  So if you leave
triggers 2-N defined but disabled, the vast majority of lines will
invoke this overhead on triggers 2-N when they can't possibly match.
Defining and undefining the triggers as needed obviously causes some
extra overhead when the sequence occurs, but overall it's usually
better; it allows some rare per-sequence overhead in order to avoid the
frequent per-line overhead.

Hi All,

I am quite new to the MUD-Stuff, but anyway everybody told me that TF is the 
thing to have. Compiling was no problem, but I don't seem to be getting over our 
Firewall.

Basically it should work via our socks-Server, but I keep getting a strange 
errormessage as soon as I connect to a MUD, saying "Bad File Number".

Does anybody here have some experience with TF behind a FW, or any idea where 
this error results from?

What I do right now is simply call "runsocks tf", which works fine for the 
normal telnet, but gives me that error with tf.

Any help will be appreciated.

Cheers, Ingo...

Hi,

either I didn't find a function that checks for existing files or it does
not exist.

My trials ended up with a problem:

how can I suppres the error generated by tfopen or /quote when the
referred file does not exist ?

/def -ag -hLOADFAIL h_loadfail = /test 0%;

does not help there, although it helps with /load, which I can't use to
check for existence of the file.

Michael (mesirii@mg.mud.de)

/def nop = /test 0%;\

def fileExists = \
    /let result=%;\
    /def -hLOADFAIL -1 -ag h_loadfail = /test 0%;\
;    /quote -S /nop '{*} %| /return {?}%;\
    /test result:=tfopen({*},"r")%;\
    /if (result!=-1) \
       /test tfclose(result)%;\
       /undef h_loadfail%; \
       /return 1%; \
    /else \
       /return 0%; \
    /endif%;

You can use a sys call to the UNIX utility test:

/test echo(sys("test -f /BOGUS"))
1
/test echo(sys("test -f /etc/passwd"))
0

Of course, that mechanism is platform dependent.

You are right.

Well I dunno if this function exists in tinyfugue, I used a simple shell
syntax instead..

/def file_exists = \
  /set file_exists=0%;\
  /eval /quote -S /set file_exists=!if [ -r %{*} ]; then echo 1;else echo 0;fi
  

I never got my own functions to work with the
  /if (file_exists({file}) == true)

so I used this.. 
  /file_exists %{file}%;\
  /if({file_exists} =~ '1')

and so on.. but I guess you guys are better at macros and functions than
me ;)

Hey there,

any of you guys ever implemented MSP for TF under linux ? any info would be
appreciated.


                                               thanks, Dingo.

Sorry :), MSP stands for Mud Sound Protocol, which is just fancy name for text
tags that specify certain sounds in certain situations, the protocol specs are
here: http://www.zuggsoft.com/zmud/msp.htm.

    The library alias.tf is not case sensitive since it
uses glob matching. Eg: if a do '/alias foo /echo bar'
foo, Foo, fOo and all the foo-s will have the same result,
echo-ing bar. I change it a little to be case sensitive
using regexp matching and it lokks like this:

/def -i alias = \
    /if ( {#} < 2 ) \
        /quote -S /~listalias `/list -s -i -mglob alias_body_%{1-*}%; \
    /else \
        /def -i alias_body_%1 = %-1%;\
        /def -i -ag -mregexp -h"send ^%1$$" alias_call_%1_1 = \
           /alias_body_%1%; \
        /def -i -ag -mregexp -h"send ^%1 (.*)$$" alias_call_%1_2 = \
           /alias_body_%1 %%P1%; \
    /endif

    Now the aliasses are case sensitive but there is 
still little problem. I can not define 2 aliasses like 
'/alias foo /echo bar1' and '/alias Foo /echo bar2' because
the macros are not case sensitive and alias_body_foo and
alias_body_Foo will be the same thing, and they will
over-write. If anyone could give me a solution how could 
I solve this (defining 2 aliases one with name foo and
the other with the name Foo) please let me know.
    Many thanks.

You could try replacing the alias names in alias_body_foo by escaped
versions, for example replace each character of the alias name by its
ascii code. so alias_body_foo would become alias_body_102111111 and
alias_body_FOO would become alias_body_070079079.
or you could just substitute upper-case characters and numbers. 
(numbers need to be escaped in this case to avoid name clashes, tf
should be able to deal with everything else)

here's the function for doing the escaping:
/def ascii_escape = \
    /let ret= %;\
    /let str=%1 %;\
    /for i 0 $[strlen(str)-1] \
	/let code=$$[ascii(substr(str, i, 1))] %%; \
        /test ret:=strcat(ret, code < 100 ? '0' : '', code) %; \
    /result '$[ret]'

 Hey,
 
 well when nobody answered my msp question few days back, i decided to poke
 around a little and write my own code, the file 

 	http://pdragon.inetsolve.com/~dingo/tf-40s1-msp-patch.tar.gz

 contains the installation instructions, and the patch for mccp enabled TF code
 created by Martin Thomson, you can get the mccp enabled source code from 
 
 	http://rabble.uow.edu.au/~weevil/download.html
 
 or you can get both mccp and msp enabled code from
 
 	http://pdragon.inetsolve.com/~dingo/tf-40s1-mccp-msp.tar.gz
 
 The MSP support uses linux/unix EsounD daemon, so you will also need to have
 libaudio0 and esound packages installed to make it work.

 Sorry windows/os-half users the MSP code will not work on your platform,
 maybe in the future when ESD gets ported to windows ;)
 
 Please read the instructions in msp/README.msp file before you try to do
 anything.
 
 					Enjoy ;)

                                                Dingo.

Having run into this with a few distribution macros now, I would like to
propose a possibly feature enhancement for TF 5.0: capability tags.

In current TF, one can restrict triggers by the use of -T typing in both
the world definition and trigger; thus, for example, the MCP macros have
-Ttiny.moo, and will only work for tiny.moo type worlds. This works great,
so long as you assume that only MOOs can do MCP - which is no longer true.

Thus, you can:

1) Change them to type tiny.mcp, and all world types, but lose all OTHER
data that depends on tiny.moo or tiny.muck or whatever.

2) Define the macro to apply to tiny*, instead - but risk contamination
in tiny.mux worlds which don't support MCP, for example.

3) Define the macros multiple times - once for each possible type-value
that you need to use them under.

4) Ask Mr. Keys to provide a way to define the "capabilities" of a world,
or required capabilites of a macro, so that you might translate "tiny.moo"
with MCP capability into "Capability = tiny,tiny-moo,mcp" or whatever other
representation is convenient, and the force a trigger to only require the
"mcp" or "tiny" capability.

I'm doing #4, for the moment. :)

You can probably do this by defining worlds as tiny.moo.map, tiny.foo.map,
etc, and doing matching on substrings to pull out the bits that you want.
As far as I know, tiny.muck, tiny.moo, etc automatic login hooks just
match on tiny.moo* etc, so you can do this without affecting anything
built-in.

You can already encode capability strings in the world type; I do this
frequently.  You can make up any capability names you want, put it between
dots in a world's -T option, and write triggers that match on that
substring of the world type.  For example, "/addworld -Ttiny.moo.mcp."
for a world that supports Tiny* login formats, TinyMOO commands, and MCP.
Then "/def -mglob -T*.mcp.*" (or "/def -mregexp -T\.mcp\.") for MCP triggers.
The triggers don't care if the world is a MOO, only that it supports MCP.

Note I put a trailing "." on the world type.  This is just for convenience,
so all my triggers can just match a trailing dot, instead of trailing dot
OR end-of-string.

If you look at the documentation for /addworld, you'll see the standard
login triggers are already set up to accept e.g. "tiny" and "tiny.*".  So
as long as you leave the login capability first, you can append any other
dot-separated capabilities you want.

New to using TF, and personally, I love it!  One functionality I can't get
to work is the following:
As the mud prints it:
Darknor tells you: "dude jump up "

When "Darknor" tells me to "jump up", I would like fed to the mud "jump up".
Or if he tells me

Darknor tells you: "dude tell morpheus you are wrong"

I would like Tf to "tell morpheus you are wrong"..  you get the idea..   a
bitch trig.  How would I go about doing this?

 Thanks!!
Elliott

To do this simply:

  /def -mregexp -t'(^> |^)Darknor tells you: \"dude (.*)\"' tBitchtrig = \
	/eval /send %P2

The first matched parenthesis will depend on your prompt.  If you dont
care about checking the beginning of the line, then substitue (.*) for it.
Keep in mind that a trig like this gives them complete control over your
TF session and will give them access to your shell account as well.
Make sure you trust the person you give this too.  I also highly
recommend checking for the beginning of the line so others can't
manipulate your trigger if they discover it.

hi people!

is it possible to filter the in/out-streams of tf?
what i want to do is following:
a command line program has to filter the stream from
socket to tf and to remove some sequences of text
(belongs to a the bsx protocol). this text is interpreted
as a description of graphics and will be displayed in a
own window. then the program has also to write on the
stream tf to socket to request data for the gfx display.
this is a bidirectonal protocol embeded in the textcommunication
between the user and the mud.
is it possible to do the things described above? or are there
other ways to do this? 

bye gawain.

Actually, from a performance standpoint, don't use (*.).  It is not needed
and is a performance hit.

  /def -mregexp -t'(^> |^)Darknor tells you: \"dude (.*)\"' tBitchtrig = \
    /eval /send %P2

without the prompt:

 /def -mregexp -t'Darknor tells you: \"dude (.*)\"' tBitchtrig = \
    /eval /send %P1

But I would add that this gives unprecedented access to your character AND
in some case your shell account or machine so I would be very careful with
how I applied such a trigger.

I have a bad habit of holding escape longer than i need to in TF, so
invariably on my chat lines, when i type, the lines starts with a ton of
ESC chars.  i know there is a way to filter my keyboard input so that i
can remove the escapes.. but i can't figure out how.. any help??

For such controlling triggers, I have written an authentication system to
validate the character giving me command.

This code uses the 'list' processing package by Susan Dittmar.

The triggers are set for a SMAUG type mud, so may need some tweeking for
your needs. This is just a simple example that you should be able to
modify and add to.


;;======================================
;; load in the list processing code
;;======================================
/load lists.tf

;;======================================
;; The list of chars authed to tell me what to do
;;======================================
/addlist authchars Charname1
/addlist authchars Charname2
/addlist authchars Charname3

;;======================================
;; Trigger on something
;;======================================
/def -F -mregexp -t" (says|tells you) \'@(.*)\'" \
  g-command = \
  /if /test {PL} =/ "{%{authchars}}" %; \
  /then \
    /send %{P1} %; \
  /endif


Using the above trigger, another character can send you commands by
preceeding them with the '@' character. However, unless their name is in
the 'authchars' list, the test will fail and nothing will happen.

I have a question about keybindings. I have, on a couple of occasions, hit
ctrl-o, and afterwards, am unable to continue typing. The only keys that seem to
work are ctrl-c and ctrl-z. Is there any key I can hit or something else I can
do to fix this?

I'm running tf on my shell acount, under SunOS 5.6.

This is due to a bug in SunOS.  Once your tf process gets in that state,
it can not be fixed.  But you can avoid it by executing this command in
the shell before starting tf:

    stty flush '^@' stop '^@' start '^@'

TF 5.0 (not yet available) will automatically work around this SunOS bug.

Hi..

  I have a small feature request for TF5.. 

  Could it be made possible to split the screen another time,
so you can have two output windows.. I would find it usefull if
I could have a small window at the top where I could filter out important
stuff that tend to scroll of the screen to quickly otherwise, then the
main world output and last the input as it is today..

now this would be a cool addition. if you could add some sort of mini split
screen at the top and could send messages to it with a command (just match a
trigger then echo to the mini screen). sounds like it would be hard to
implement though. :-(

Well - at least on Unix-like systems this functionality is easy to
realize with the current tf.
First create a named pipe for every additional window you need.
Then open some xterms, and start a 'tail -f fifoname' in each xterm. Now
let tf open all those fifos as files on startup and set up some
triggers, that write into these fifos using tfwrite. Thats it.
If you want to log the text of the additional windows, then just use
regular files instead of fifos.

I have some code written to that effect, as well as a program (called
"fork") which changes it's process group and forks off a specified
command (thus keeping tf from waiting for the program to exit).

I can mail that stuff to the list, if anyone cares to see it.

Perhaps I'm missing something, but this would only work under X, correct? I
got the impression the original poster was looking more for a single-window
approach, something far more appropriate for those limited to console only
access.

Sorry if my response is tangent to the original question.  This response
caught my eye on the 'console only access', so I thought I'd requote it,
and then post what I do in case it is useful to someone else.

I generally just use 'more' and 'tab' while running multiple worlds.  I'm
using a screen session which works on console.  I open my telnet session
from home and reattach the screen session, do what I want in TinyFugue...
PINE is right there, and I have 'less -f ~/tf-dir/tiny.log' in another
'screen', if I think to bother with it.  Thus my console activity at home
is happy both for working on one remote telnet session as well as letting
me have the other console windows open for localhost activity.

Then I go to work where I have X.  I reattach the console session right
there in an X window (xterm or KDE konsole) as if I'd never logged out
from home.  Then I do console work in other xterm/ konsole windows while
keeping an eye on the TF/PINE session.

BTW, using 'less' on the global logfile lets me do word searches back and
forth through the log, as well as review surronding pages back or forth.  
Having needed and used the power of 'less' a few times, I wouldn't
consider having a window just spew output when I can actually do something
useful with it, when I want.

Again, none of this may be useful or pertinent to anyone else, I just
thought I'd toss in how TinyFugue works out for me. ;)

Heya all, due to overwhelming user request I have to figure out how to do 
this. I need to disable the keyboard echoing when visual mode is off. ie,
when a user types in a command, it won't be repeated on the screen. The same
for normal input to a mud. 

I'm greatly appreciative of any answers you can give me.

Hello.. my question is this:
How can I set my environment up so that I can type in /visual off mode, and 
yet not echo my input to the screen.. as /visual off does.
Thanks...

Answer my own question :)
/visual on

/set status_fields=''
/set status_pad=

But another one.. how can I grab the current world into a macro?

${world_name}, from within a macro execution, will tell you the world context
you're in, if any.

fg_world() (function call) will tell you the current world that the user
has in the foreground, if any.  Will often be quite different from
${world_name}.

Thanks to Myrrdin and Karen .. however I must apologise for not making 
myself clearer. I know about fg_world() but I don't know enough about making 
macros to actually call it.
Naively I thought /echo fg_world() might work.. but obviously it didn't.. so 
how do I just call up world name to me screen?
That's what I should have asked in the first place.

Going back to my first question, my own answer which isn't good enough for 
me now.. but is there a way to make tf gag its own input in visual off 
rather than the way I suggested (putting visual on but hiding all the visual 
bits)?

Many thanks..

I tried to abort /load with an /exit contained in the file but
surprisingly the /load still returned 1 instead of the intended 0 ?

Is this a bug or feature ?

I want to build some like 10 000 rooms by TF using my mud and OLC, it would
be a map for other areas. You know, let's imagine a square 100*100. What I
want is to create a map in ASCII file (different letters or numbers for
different sectors) and then, basing on it, preprocess such a  map into a
world (I'm not sure if it's clear, but probably is). When I'd be able to
convert a letter into particular sector and then link that room to other
rooms according to the map it should be done. It'd take like 24 hours or
more of OLC offline work but ... Anyone ever did something similar and want
to share experience with me? I'm probably able to make it on my own, but
hints and advices would be useful.

I use Tf on my Win98 machine. I was wondering if there was a way to 
configure a command to warn me of activity ("beep", or causing the console 
tab to flash, or something) when it's minimized, only. I can see if there's 
new activity when I have the console in the foreground just fine. However, 
sometimes I want to work on two things at once, and I never know when 
something happens in a world!

Hello here :)

I've recently decided to turn on logging always for all my mudding sessions
and added this to my tf files:

; *** Automatic logging

/set LC_TIME=C
/eval /set logfile=~/private/mud/CF/logs/automatic/\
  $[world_info()].$[ftime("%d-%B-%Y-%H:%M:%S", time())]
/eval /log -w %logfile
/eval /log -i %logfile
/eval /log -l %logfile

This works pretty well but I've got some problem too. Everything is logged
fine except for the prompts from the mud if I enter some command at the
prompt. When I do something like this in my terminal

<100%hp 100%m 100%mv> kill fido
You start aiming at the strong beastly fido.
...

in the log file I see

kill fido
You start aiming at the strong beastly fido.
...

Is there any way to log the prompts with commands on the same line?

I'm using TF for an alternate interface to a chat tool which
is used at work.  The server requires a specific protocol and
sends a nasty error out to all users when this protocol is
not followed.  What I'm trying to accomplish is:

user must use specific commands (macros already defined)

if user hits "Return" or types some text and hits "Return"
I need to have this text discarded.

All commands start with "/" so if the user text is blank
or doesn't start with "/", discard the text.

How would one accomplish this?

TIA

Tom

You'd need to figure out a hook, I think a hook on * would do it, 
that just does nothing, or chucks out an error.

/def -T"type-of-this-world" -h'SEND *' hook_text= \
   /echo "Error!"

or something like that?

Not tested, just imagined.

Does anyone maintain a archive site of config, macro, trig files from the 
mailing list? I have found several personal TF sites searching WWW most were 
dead links or old sites.

Not as far as I know, no.

Most of the stuff that gets posted here needs context and stuff
to make sense anyway.

I am in the process of moving my TinyFugue for Win32 site to a new home and
adding some features to the site, in addition to removing the Win32 since
it's become a little more generic.  Anyways, the new home has a Code Library
backend engine for other languages that could easily be extended to support
a TinyFugue library.

As a matter of fact that sounds like an excellent idea...

If you would like to browse the code library design and make suggestions,
feel free.  Bear in mind that it is only about 20-30% complete, but it is
coming back up to speed slowly.

The code library is at http://www.wilburware.net (follow the links)

The library would be linked into the Druware website as it gets it's new
home, and hopefully will move back into my basement from it's virtual host
in July, where I can better manage the box.

I want to temporaryly supress all output from a current world to the
screen.
One way I found was using /fg, but I get activity messages.
another way was turning off hooks, but I don't know if this does more
harm
than good, is there a way to just turn off output ? I still want it to
get logged
though.

hi - Hope this is going where it's supposed to as the confirmation
message(s) (and I can forward them for proof) did NOT state any other
address to send messages to specific to the TF mailing list.

I was wondering if it were possible, of if there were plans for a TF
server for linux?  It'd be great for my users to be able to use TF without
having it on their personal machine.  I know it can be compiled with many
restrictions on use.  I think that these restrictions are fairly adequate
if implemented properly.  I can't imagine it being too hard to add, but
then again I'm not the one writing or contributing to the code so I can't
really talk - nor do I have an understanding of the TCP/IP stack in
general.

I guess it would just be easier to set up users on the machine and allow
them to run TF, but I was thinking it may be less resource-consumptive,
and easier in the administration side, to have a TF server...

Anyways, thank you for your time and I hope this message gets sent in the
right direction.

Later,
Mike
"Checkbook!!"

What would a "tf server" do?  From your discussion it sounds like a port
you'd telnet to and you'd be popped into a restricted TF session...  If
so, why not just make a passwordless account with TF as the login shell?
I just gave it a try and it seems to work fine.

Linux is already "good to go" for doing this.  No mods to tf are needed.

Perhaps obviously, if you give each user a shell account, they can
just run tf themselves.  This is your safest alternative, IMHO, and
gives them the most flexibility to customize individually.

But that might be kind of tedious if you're not using shell accounts
for any other purpose, and you might simply be looking for an
alternative to that.  In that case, you can just create one single
user account called "tf" (for example) and have its shell be the
tinyfugue binary.

Under RedHat 6.2, with the tf binary in /usr/local/bin, the following
"adduser" command worked for me:

    adduser -d /tmp -M -s /usr/local/bin/tf
    passwd tf

Then your users can just log in as "tf" and *BOOM* they're in tf.

(You could even have no password at all on the account, but PLEASE
don't make me convince you what a bad idea that is.)

Security afterthought: you'll proably want to use a different home
directory, now that I think about it, since there are certainly some
security risks in letting tf run out of /tmp.  A hostile user could
throw a harmful .tfrc in there, for example.  Be careful anywhere you
set this up, in fact - a clever "/log .tfrc" could potentially do some
interesting things anywhere you let it live.  Not letting the "tf"
user have write access to its own home directory (or any files at all,
even) would probably be a good idea.

Good luck and have fun!  And give me a password if it works ;)

Possibly limited support for personalized world files, that sort of thing?

This could probably be implemented as a fairly simple wrapper program,
which would get a name, change to a directory, and start tf with -f, or
create a new directory based on a name, possibly requiring a password or
just telling you to ask the system admin for a login...

That's actually not a bad idea.  I'd use it.  (reminicent of the old
rogue and roguelike servers that mobbed around for a while...anyone
remember those?)

-- Example follows --

[jlarue ~]$ telnet tfserver
Trying 123.45.67.89...
Connected to tfserver.whoeveryouare.com

terminal connect

Why not give the user a .tfrc and use some tf macros to handle the
"user" thing?  Or if you want password protection but not general shell
access give the account a name and a home dir but make the shell tf.

Restricted TF isn't going to be able to write any files (afaik) so for
your application I'd just create a bunch of default worlds based on user
requests.

I have a pretty good scroll back macro going.  It's based off of the
scrollback code someone
posted here a while back.  Mine goes a bit futher, first of all, it
turns off output from the current world by using
the /FG and /BG commands and using /HOOKS off and on.  I didn't know a
better way to do this but one of the most anoying things in scrollback
that we had was that input from the world screws you up while you scroll
back.  also you can page up/down and also go up one line or down one
line at a time.  I have yet to add home/end which would jump you to the
top and bottom.

This one works much cleaner than the original.  I wish I could have used
the -q option in /recall for it, but I found out there is a bug with
that, if you do a /recall -q it empties it into the scrollback buffer,
this had me going for 4 hours till I found out what that's what it was.

To enter the scrollback you press pageup which activates several macros
and keybindings, to drop out i'll probably use the <esc> key or just
simplly make you press pgdown 2x when you hit the bottom of the scroll
buffer.  I haven't decided yet.  My code should be a lot more easier to
understand too :) when I have it down i'll post it in a message here as
part of the message.

When you exit out it will set the bindings back to what kb.bash set's
them too, this can be easily changed as it's seen in the code.

Set tf as the shell (ensure it's not in /etc/shells, otherwise ftp will be
allowed), set the home directory to one which does not allow write
permissions to the user(s), and wrap it to prevent it spawning itself
(i.e., /sh, /quote .. !"..", etc)

Ok I have a nice scrollback routine going, there is a few problems.
First I managed to make use of escape code to clear the screen setting
the cursor to 1,1, but the echo command appeneds a CRLF to it, so one line
is wasted, also each time that code is sent it goes into the history.  So I need

a way if there is one to temporary turn off recording history when things get
echo'd. here is the code below.
======================
;Scroll back history tool
;PgUp brings you into the scroll back; places the world in the background;
;     also it pages up thru the scroll back one page at a time.
;PgDn Does the same as above except it doesn't activate scroll back.
;control - T to jump to the top
;control - B to jump to the bottom
;control - Q to exit the scroll back
;
;NOTES:
;Make sure scroll_history_size is set to the what ever /histsize is set
;to, if not the scroll_back will be flakey :)
;the /FG and /BG may cause problems for people using mulitple worlds.
;till I find a way to supress output but have it buffered this is the
;only way I know how.
;If anyone knows of a better way to turn off activity messages or trigger
;messages from other worlds let me know.
;thanks.  The code may be a little buggy but am using it regulary now.

;the size of your scroll back buffer
/set scroll_history_size 10000

;scroll back is on or off flag

It's an interesting exercise but wouldn't it be a bit simpler to either
turn on logging and have a macro that shells out and does a more on the
log? Or just dumps the current scrollback to a temp file, jump to a shell
and use more on that?

You get the full functionality of more (or less or most or whatever
editor/file viewer you want), tf doesn't need to keep all that code, tf
keeps on chugging so no worries about fg/bg and/or losing incoming data
while you are viewing old data.

I want to build a hook that, when it sees activity in a world
instead of going "Activity in world xxxx" it switches to that
world and displays the activity.

Actually I want a macro which turns 'more' prompts off and the
above functionality on, and another one that does the reverse and
sets overything back to normal :)

Why?  So I can watch the laptop without needing to press any
keys.

I could probably build it if I thought hard enough but it's
hurting my brain.

Ok here's a question.
It was suggested to me to simply create an account on my machine called
'tf' and have the tf  binary as the shell and that will handle that.
That's all fine and good, but what if I DON'T want these users on the
server machine?
The mush is behind the firewall on a different machine and I'm
successfully using port-forwarding for connections to it, and if I wanted
the users to have telnet access to this machine (we'll call it winbloze -
that's the machine name) to their tf account which also resides on it then
I guess the best resolution would be to change the telnet port on
'winbloze' (umm...I'm _NOT_ actually using winbloze on this machine btw,
so no flames) to something different and forward that port from the server
right?
Also I'd want ssh access to that tf account behind the firewall so the
same principle basically applies right?

Just asking for input.
Later,
Mike

Hi,

I have a problem implementing the functions provided by tf into a
macro/trigger.
Could please someone sent me an example how to use for example the substr()
function?
Or also the example given by the tf-help

/def -t"*test*" otto = /send say substr(%1,3,1)  <-- doesn't work however I
try ..
    was trying to use %substr /substr [subst.. ([substr (substr..
    I'm simply out of ideas and my programming knowledge isn't so very good


0 + substr(dbref, strchr(dbref, "#") + 1)

I believe an example how I could use a mud-text looking like "You say
'123und45'"
to calculate 123-45 and give it to the mud as 'say' command could solve my
questions
and problems with this.

Thanks,
    Shannon.

try that below, maybe that's what you expected:

/def -t"*test*" otto = /send say $[substr(%1,3,1)]

Hmm, don't you wan't just such an easy thing like this, assuming that your
triggered line is: "You say test 123 und 45"?

/def -mglob -t"*test*" otto1 = say $[%3 + %5]

if it's not what you wanted and you want our help with that to make
something more sophisticated lemme know.

I have written a prompt hook which catches my prompt and set ups some
things from it in the status line. It works just fine. But there is
one problem. When i turn ANSI colors on the mud - tf doesn't recognize
my prompt anymore. Is there any solution of this problem? I still
want to have ANSI colors.

You need to be in raw mode /set emulation=raw I think will do it.
But then certain other things may not work right, if you're in ansi_attr
there
is no real way to capture the ansi color escape codes.

If 5.0 ever comes out maybe it will allow us to do that :)

I ran into the same problem a while ago. The thing is: Even with
%emulation set to "ansi_attr" the prompt hook always gets the
prompt in _raw_ format. When you turn on colors, your prompt hook
receives a lot of ansi codes, and i guess you have set up your
patterns for processing the prompt in plain text. With the added
ansi codes (like "<esc>[37m" etc), they wont match any longer.
I solved this by stripping all ansi codes from the prompt first,
by the use of replace(). Then i continue processing its content
for the status line...

Hello to all here (anyone alive?)!

This mail list used to be much more active a two years ago when I was
subscribed to it. Now I resubscribe and it seems to be dead.

Anyways, I sent a mail to it about a month ago and got no answer. I know it
was Christmas and all so I decided to repost.

I play Carrion Fields MUD (carrionfields.com:9999), it is a ROM 2.3 based
mud and it sends unterminated prompts like all diku muds do.

I've recently decided to turn on logging always for all my mudding sessions
and added this to my tf files:

; *** Automatic logging

/set LC_TIME=C
/eval /set logfile=~/private/mud/CF/logs/automatic/\
  $[world_info()].$[ftime("%d-%B-%Y-%H:%M:%S", time())]
/eval /log -w %logfile
/eval /log -i %logfile
/eval /log -l %logfile

This works pretty well but I've got some problem too. Everything is logged
fine except for the prompts from the mud if I enter some command at the
prompt. When I do something like this in my terminal

<100%hp 100%m 100%mv> kill fido
You start aiming at the strong beastly fido.
...

in the log file I see

kill fido
You start aiming at the strong beastly fido.
...

Is there any way to log the prompts with commands on the same line? All I
want is a log to be exact copy of what I see in my terminal. Am I asking
too much? I think all mud clients do this.

If you apply this patch, TF will compile on 2.11 BSD (pdp11) without
too much trouble. It's mostly a matter of replacing 'return 0' by
'return newint(0)', but includes a few other useful improvements as
well.
Btw. I haven't checked the entire source for 'return 0', but only the
places my compiler complained about ;-)

	I hope it's appropriate to ask this on this list.  If not, I
apologize in advance.

	I've scoured all the tf resource sites I could find and I still
haven't seen this, so I'm hoping one of you can help.

	I want to write some code that will automatically 'log' all
"tells" I get in a diku-style mud.
	for example:

	Arastorin tells you 'meet me in Cave City'

	Lines like that to be pushed to a queue or list or some other sort
of container with an associated command to view all the past tells and a
command to clear the list.

	Before I go through he effort to write this code myself (I had
something similar to this before, but lost all my tf code when my shell
account was removed), I want to see if anyone else has anything similar to
this that they are willing to share.

Thanks in advance!

you could use a quite easy approach (otherwise you can also use my list
package which deals with key-value lists as well as arrays)

/def -t"* tells you *" -mglob t_tells_me = \
/set tell_list=%tell_list###%*%;

/def clear_tells = /set tell_list=

/def show_tells = \
	/let temp=%tell_list%;\

how to get 2 status lines on tinyfugue? i presume i'd
have to edit that into the source prior to compiling
but would appreciate if anyone knew of another way or
had a modified version already done that i could get...

On this MUD that I am on and whenever I improve a skill i would like to
be able to look at that skill and see what percentage it is at
currently.
There are 2 different messages that appear when you improve a skill:

You learn from your mistakes, and your * skill improves.
You have become better at *!

The * indicates where the skill name appears.
In order to see what percentage it is at I need to type:

learned *

Now, I have tried the following triggers and they do not work

/trigger *You have become better at *!*=learned %5
/def -mregexp -t"You have become better at (.*)!" = learned %P5
/def -t"You have become better at {*}!" learned = learned %1
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'You have become better at (.*)!' = /send learned
%P1

I have gotten them thru reading the help file and thru a few online
sources that didn't show exactly how to do it, but i thought that a
little modification would be fine..
But I also have a problem that MIGHT be related to this matter.  In help
triggers Hawkeye gives an example:

/def -t"{*} has arrived." greet = :waves to %1.

Now I would think that typing:
/test echo Jason has arrived.
   OR
/echo Jason has arrived.
would give me:
Jason waves to Jason.
But I get:
% test: expression syntax error: expected operator, found 'test'. for
/test echo, and nothing for just the /echo, only Jason has arrived.
BUT I have NO problem at all with the 30 or so other triggers I have.  I
have been using TF for about 4yrs now, and I know my way around it
well...but for some reason this has eluded me.

HELP :-(


TIA,
Jason

PS: For those that are wondering what MUD I might be talking about it is
one called Aardwolf @ aardwolfmud.org 4000.  NO, this is not a plug for
it..just thought I would give the info up :-)

Try this :-

/def -mregexp -t'You have become better at (.*)\! lrn = /send learned %{P1}

Use the 'trigger' command to test triggers.  ie.

/trigger You have become better at dancing!

Thanks for the tip about using /trigger....i woulda thought that the
text would do it so that is why i was using the /test echo

So after all is said and done the one that worked is:
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'You have become better at (.*)!' = learned %P1
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'You learn from your mistakes, and your (.*) skill
improves.' = learned %P1

Thanks so much Keith!!!

Subject: Re: status_line x2


On this MUD that I am on and whenever I improve a skill i would like to
be able to look at that skill and see what percentage it is at
currently.
There are 2 different messages that appear when you improve a skill:

You learn from your mistakes, and your * skill improves.
You have become better at *!

The * indicates where the skill name appears.
In order to see what percentage it is at I need to type:

learned *

Now, I have tried the following triggers and they do not work

/trigger *You have become better at *!*=learned %5
/def -mregexp -t"You have become better at (.*)!" = learned %P5
/def -t"You have become better at {*}!" learned = learned %1
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'You have become better at (.*)!' = /send learned
%P1

I have gotten them thru reading the help file and thru a few online
sources that didn't show exactly how to do it, but i thought that a
little modification would be fine..
But I also have a problem that MIGHT be related to this matter.  In help
triggers Hawkeye gives an example:

/def -t"{*} has arrived." greet = :waves to %1.

Now I would think that typing:
/test echo Jason has arrived.
   OR
/echo Jason has arrived.
would give me:
Jason waves to Jason.
But I get:
% test: expression syntax error: expected operator, found 'test'. for
/test echo, and nothing for just the /echo, only Jason has arrived.
BUT I have NO problem at all with the 30 or so other triggers I have.  I
have been using TF for about 4yrs now, and I know my way around it
well...but for some reason this has eluded me.

HELP :-(


TIA,
Jason

	For those that MUD in color (on muds that have ansi colors), it
would be really cool if we could somehow 'log' the colored output in an
html format which will 'tag' all of the appropriate color codes.  This
would enable players to post battle logs on the web in all of their
color-glory.

	Do you guys know if anything like this exists for tf?

I would suggest that you name all of the macros you write. This doesn't
make much difference to their functionality, but it does allow you more
flexibility in working with them.

Just put a name before the = to add a name, ie :-

/def -p1 -mregexp -t'You have become better at (.*)!' learn1 = learned %P1

would create the trigger called 'learn1'. If you want to remove the
trigger for some reason, then you can '/undef learn1'.

When you have hundreds of triggers and macros this becomes an important
management tool.

Triggers match text coming from a world.  They either match text from
any world, or if defined with "-w", a specific world.

The results of /echo are sent directly to the display.  /echo is
basically a way to get feedback from TinyFugue itself.

If you wanted to test triggers without using /trigger you'd have to
arrange for the text to come back from the world itself.

Well internally, logging strips the color attributes anyways, so it would
require a code modification I think.  Ken can correct me if I'm wrong :-).
That said, adding code to the stripping mechanism to convert it to HTML
probably wouldn't be that brtual, though the output HTML would probably be
so malformed that most browser would blow chunks on it.

The only way tf supports executing a command some time later is the repeat
command

/def x = /echo Waiting for 5 seconds%;\
	 /repeat -5 1 /echo Done\%;/echo Waiting%;

if you want to order repeat to execute more than one command you have to
escape all the % and $ in your code

alternatively you can use:

/def x = /Waiting for %1 seconds%;\
	 /repeat -%1 1 /x2

/def x2 = /echo Done%;\
	  /echo Waiting%;

the problem there is to keep the context alive (global vars :()
and never to forget that /repeat is an asychronous command
i.e. it runs in parallel to your normal input/output

another way to stop tf completely is:
/sh sleep 5

or

/def wait = \
	/let time=$[time()]%;\
	/while (time()-time<{1}) \
	/done

which is very bad as it consumes your whole computing power :)

Thats my knowledge

Okay, I have another one for you guys.  I figured since I got such great
help with my other question that I might be able to get help figuring
this one out as well. :-)

The MUD I am on also has Quests that are automated by a mob.
He talks a little giving you the name of the mob you have to kill, the
Area it is in and the room name.

The Area name comes out like this:
Questor tells you 'of The Old Cathedral.'

Now, for this I would like something like:
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'Questor tells you 'of (.*).'' quest1 = /%P1

one of the obvious problems is the ' mark before the "of" and after the
. since u need to begin and end the statement u want with a ' mark.
So i tried putting in a * to take the place of the ' marks as a wild
card but it wont work:
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'Questor tells you *of (.*).*' quest1 = /%P1

Is there something that i can put in there so that the extra ' marks
wont be a problem?  Heck, i tried /gag ' but that didn't work..thought
that if i gagged all ' marks i would be fine.

Now from here arises another problem.... In the case I gave above, I
would like to go to The Old Cathedral by the /%P1 command, BUT I can't.
I can't because I can't do:
/def The Old Cathedral=Speedwalk

because I get:
% def: illegal macro name "The Old Cathedral".

I tried by setting it into a trigger:
/trig The Old Cathedral=Speedwalk

And that works, but it would suck if someone SAID "The Old Cathedral" or
if i typed "area" (which lists ALL of the areas) - Can u imagine typing
"area" and ALL my triggers going off for the over 150 areas?

Thanks so much again,
Jason

try this:
/def -p1 -mregexp -t"Questor tells you 'of (.*).'" quest1 = /%P1

in most cases it works :)

As well as the solution that was posted earlier, you can also 'escape' the
reserved characters in the match. This is a standard technique on unix
systems. ie :-

/def -p1 -mregexp -t'Questor tells you \'of (.*).\'' quest1 = /%P1

Note the use of the \ before the reserved character. Of course, in this
case you could have used " instead of ' to deliniate the pattern, but if
you are trying to match a * or ( etc, then you need to escape the
character.

You can use double-quotes too.  But I think that the type of quoting
makes no difference.  To embed the single-quote, backslash-escape it,
and remember to double-escape as it's a quoted string:
 /def -mregexp -t"Questor tells you \\'of (.*)\\.\\'" quest1 = /%P1
Described under "/help def", the bit on "-t".

> So i tried putting in a * to take the place of the ' marks as a wild
> card but it wont work:
> /def -p1 -mregexp -t'Questor tells you *of (.*).*' quest1 = /%P1

In a regexp, the asterisk ``*'' means "zero or more of the previous
atom".  You want a period, ``.'', to match any character.  Hence ``.*''
means "zero or more of any character".  See "/help regexp".

See "/help def", almost at the end, where it describes <name> and which
characters are allowed in a macro name.

Also, you can avoid problems with "Questor tells you 'of dc.'" if you
do something like start the macros with a prefix to indicate what
they're for.

Try substituting bad characters with an underscore.  Or, alternatively,
since I just failed miserably to do this (my tinyfugue is rusty & I need
sleep ;^), just join the words and hope that you don't have "foo bar"
and "foobar" as separate quests.  Unfortunately, I just failed to do
this too.  I keep getting bitten by not being able to split a string
into a list and by not being able to get /tr to work.  Either would help
me here.

I miss having something like regsub(), or am I looking in the wrong
place?  :^/

Perhaps I've been writing too much Perl ...

Can someone please explain to _me_ why this doesn't work?

 /def phil_TheOldCathedral = Speedwalk
and:
 /require tr.tf
 /def -mregexp -t"Questor tells you \\'of (.*)\\.\\'$" quest1 = \
 	/phil_$[tr(" ", "_", {P1})]

I've messed around with the right-hand-side of that a lot and haven't
found something which works.  Anything after a space in %P1 gets
dropped.  (I have of course verified that the entire string is actually
in %P1 with another macro).

Separately (kind of): what's the current timescale for tf 5?  :^)

Thanks.  I originally latched onto tr() because I wanted to replace
other characters too.

Can anyone provide a tinyfugue incantation for:
 s/[^A-Za-z0-9_]/_/g
please?

Yet again you guys all blow me away!!!
damn, i thought i was good with some of the minor things I have done
with TF, but i see i dont know half the shit u guys do :-)
I've never had a head for coding so that might be it..to bad there isn't
something like a program that will do these things for you
automatically..then i wouldnt feel so dumb with the questions :-)

Wasn't someone doing a Tk-based graphical front-end for constructing
tinyfugue defs?

My memory of this is hazy & dimmed by a couple of years, though.

Wouldn't it be better to code such an thing in java that all users of tf

The overhead of writing portable code in C(++) using well known
GUI-Engines should be ignoreable. And the benefits over java should be
known. Especially in combination with tf. :)

Hi.
While programming a script i've met such problem:

Can i make an alias (or def) that is executed anytime i'll
write sth starting from specified key(s) ?
For example i have a macro:

/def zzz /echo Started..

Now i want to startthat def by writing:

start
start34543
startturtyr
starting
start@#$@

...just existance of five (just example ofcourse) first signs is enough
for tf to understand that def echoing 'Started' to screen must be started.

Does anybody know how to do it if only thats possible?

Kalreg.

Yeah, there is a new build at it's new home (beware of falling rocks on the
website though), complete with a new installer, and hopefully much more
functional on Win9X.

/help time, here's some example of putting it into variable:

/setenv time_variable=$[expr(ftime("%s",time()))]

You can echo it and do whatever you wish.

s - is not available on all unixlike platforms (it's number of seconds from
sooome date, heh), try "man ftime" under linux to get more options or /help
ftime under tf. You can put whatever among "".

Does it help at all? If not, precise what is it supposed to do exactly.
Besides as you're from Poland, here's my help page about tf in Polish
(suggestions and comments about it are welcome): http://killer.mud.pl

Mareks' solution :
/setenv time_variable=$[expr(ftime("%s",time()))]
doesn't work

Michael's solutions :
/set atime=$[time()]
doesn't work

/test atime:=time()
works.

Marek, please try:
 /eval /echo sub is %{sub}

Does it by any chance say "full" ?

Wojciech -- if you use them on the right-hand-side of a macro
definition, they will work.

If you put an /eval at the start, they will work.

You might also want to use one of Ken Keys' suggestions for .tfrc:
/def -b'^[^M' =3D /sub full%;/dokey newline%;/sub off

With that, if you use escape-enter, instead of enter, to finish a line
then substitution will be turned on for that line only.  Very useful for
testing things like the above.

	After a few hours of searching, I found your perl script - it works great,
thanks!

	The only way I can see using it in the current capacity is to set the
terminal emulation to RAW instead of ansi_attr, and then converting the
logfile to html.  I wish there was a way to specify when logging that you
want to log out as raw output instead of filtered output.  I looked through
the source code for a few hours and was unable to figure out how to do this.
Do any of you know if this is a trivial change?

Thanks,
-Jeff Billimek

How do I work with multiple lines?

Questor tells you 'As a reward, I am giving you 15 quest points and 1136
gold.'
** You gain a bonus practice ** 

I already have the first  part:
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'As a reward, I am giving you (.*) quest points and
(.*) gold' quest2=ft %P1 qp & %P2 gold

But how do i get it to read the 2nd line (** You gain a bonus practice
** ) and add that into the command?

My first guess would that i need 2 seperate triggers..one for WITH and
one for WITHOUT, but i dont even know how to get it to read the 2nd line
and put it in.

My second guess is to do it by doing a seperate trigger that will say it
afterwards..

/def -p1 -mregexp -t'** You gain (.*) **:'quest3=ft kewl, I got %P1!

Any ideas on reading multiple lines and converting it all into ONE
macro/trigger?


Thanks again to everyone that has and might answer :-)

One trigger which matches the first line.  On the right hand side,
define a one-shot trigger.  The one-shot matches the second line, no
matter what, but if it's the specific line you want, it deals with it
appropriately.

Make sure that the defined one-shot is a fall-through trigger;
otherwise, you'd not have the normal triggers match.  You probably want
it to be raised priority too.  See "/help def" and "-n" and "-p".

If you can't construct one regexp which matches anyway (I forget how
difficult this is -- not done it in tf in years), then on the
right-hand-side of the first trigger, define _two_ one-shot triggers.
Each trigger issues an /undef of the other one.  Both are fall-through,
raised priority.  The second one-shot trigger should match _any_ line,
and so should also have a lower priority than the first one.

Make sense?

Your second guess may do it if you escape the asteriks
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'\*\* You gain (.+) \*\*' quest3=ft kewl, I got %P1!

If the string you get is the same you could also use simple matching to
catch it.
/def -p1 -msimple -t'** You gain a bonus practice **' quest3=\
	ft kewl, I got a bonus practice!

I guess you get the bonus practice only sometimes ?

The idea phil proposed is not that easy to use :)
first you have to define another trigger within your trigger that matches
all lines, then within that trigger you have to check for the correct
string:

/def -p1 -mregexp \
 -t'As a reward, I am giving you ([0-9]+) quest points and ([0-9]+) gold'\
quest2=\
ft %P1 qp & %P2 gold%;\
/def -n1 -p100 -F -t'*' -mglob quest2_1 = \
/if ({*}=~"** You gain a bonus practice **") \
	ft kewl, I got a bonus practice!\%;\
/endif%;

the other thing would to define two triggers in your first one :)
one checking for the match, an the second undefining the check-trigger if
it didn't check :)

Have fun

Let's say someone has made a trigger in that way:

/trig *You are hungry* = eat apple

How to switch it off? He hasn't set any chance there - nothing - just in a
way it's there. One obvious way is to switch off all th triggers, he can of
course make it with a name, priority, matching, chance and everything, like
/def -..., but ... he has something like this - what to do with that? Maybe
I minunderstood /untrig command, but I dunno. Hmm, another thing is to set
some like:

/trigc 0 *....
/trigc 100 *...

but well - they're not undefined and have not priority then, so well, once
they work, once not when I trigc 100 them (as usual without priorities -
randomly :)). I can make some macro incrementing priorities each time I
switch it off or on, but oh well:)

Okies, the question is, because I have been using /defs for whole my life -
how to /untrig it or /trigpc so that I'd be able to switch them on and off
on my will? Probably am dumb, but who cares :) Hehe.

the \ at the end of any line can be used to structure your little programs
tf will connect all lines ending with a \ to a single structure but it is
important to watch out that NO character not even a space is after the \.
But just the newline.

OOPS i forgot them :-)

And no there was NO space or other characters there at all..it just
wouldn't work.

And yeah, oddly enuf, i can read the code much easier if it is all on
one line, rather than on several lines..i dunno why...maybe I am just
odd that way ;-)

The problem also appears wenn newlines and linefeeds appear in the file
be sure you have newlines only

otherwise convert the format to unix using any of the tools available

Hmm I don't even want to think of reading my tf files each macro on one
line, or what would you do with files of 5000 lines of codes shrunk to a
mere 100 :)

look at this:
/def -p1 -mregexp \
 -t'As a reward, I am giving you ([0-9]+) quest points and ([0-9]+) gold'\
quest2=\
ft %P1 qp & %P2 gold%;\
/def -n1 -p100 -F -t'*' -mglob quest2_1 = \
/if ({*}=~"** You gain a bonus practice **") \
        ft kewl, I got a bonus practice!\%;\
/endif%;

this is the code I gave you :)
not that what you did :)

you could change this to deal with the different bonuses:

/def -p1 -mregexp \
 -t'As a reward, I am giving you ([0-9]+) quest points and ([0-9]+) gold'\
quest2=\
ft %P1 qp & %P2 gold%;\
/def -n1 -p100 -F -t'*' -mglob quest2_1 = \
/if (regmatch("[*]+ You gain (.+) [*]+",{*})) \
        ft kewl, I got \%P1!\%;\
/endif%;

I won't try to explain the code you produced :)
But do never forget to escape (with \ ) any % and $ in the nested /def.

Michael Hunger has pointed me towards -E.

Thanks -- I thought that there was another hook, but couldn't find it
when I briefly looked earlier.  *doh*

Michael: This will work for a trigger.  A trigger is just a definition.
My example was not using a trigger, as I wanted to be able to test it.
But yes, -E is much nicer and cleaner.  I think that I may need to go
change some of my macros ...

You can use any expression with the -E option, but:

other expressions than single flags slow down your triggers as they are
testet each time a trigger is checked.

using expressions that contain =3D is also not possible a a flaw in the
def parser interprets this =3D to signal the beginning of the macro body :(

otherwise you can also store your triggers in a variable defining them by
evaluating the variable and undefining them with undef or purge.

For seldom needed mass triggers this should be the fastest way (according
to a statement Ken issued earlier)

lets say i want to have a repeat like this every time i move:
/repeat -0:0:5 1 say noodel

ok, how do i kill the repeat if i move fast and want it to 'say noodel'
only once when i get to the place i want to be at, given that i do not
stop after every move and wait for 5 seconds for my char to say noodel.

i know i can kill repeats by their process id and i know how to get
the id from /ps, but is there a way for the repeat that i define
at a given moment to return its pid when it is defined?

any other ways of doing this?

If I understood your problem correctly you want to do something like this:

/def noodel = \
	/repeat -5 1 say noodel%;\
	/set last_noodel_pid=%?%;

/def kill_noodel = \
	/if (last_noodel_pid!=0) \
	   /kill %last_noodel_pid%;\
	/endif%;\


see /help repeat, the section about return values

It's driving me pretty crazy. 

I want to use the terrific program 'filterm' to type 8 bit. But tiny fugue
keeps taking off the high bit. Even if I set meta_esc and istrip to off. It
simply doesn't listen, it keeps smartassly insisting on translating ? to f.


I'm using the latest debian. I think the locales are messed upped
constantly, so I don't want to depend on it, I simply want to tell tf that
I'm typing 8 bits.

What can I do?

Edit the source.  keyboard.c.  The bit of code which does this stripping
is this:
-----------------------------< cut here >-------------------------------
    for (i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        if (istrip) buf[i] &= 0x7F;
        if (!is_print(buf[i]) && buf[i] & 0x80) {
            if (meta_esc)
                Stringadd(current_input, '\033');
            buf[i] &= 0x7F;
        }
        Stringadd(current_input, mapchar(buf[i]));
    }
-----------------------------< cut here >-------------------------------

The "(!is_print(buf[i]) && buf[i] & 0x80)" means "if it's not printable
in the current locale and the top bit is set".  And the next bit escapes
the character if meta_esc is set, then strips the top bit.

Remove the "buf[i] &= 0x7F;" after the meta_esc check.  And on your head
rest the consequences.

Uhm, maybe try apt-get update && apt-get upgrade :)

Hello,

I play on a mud where the ticks are variable length.  They are always a
*minimum* of x amount of seconds, but may vary between 10-20 seconds beyond
that.

What I'd like to do is this -

Have a macro that would send a cr every second or so till it sees my hp, or
mana increase, and then reset the tick timer to 75 seconds again.  I've
figured out how to get the values out of my prompt and into a variable, but
my prompt has disappeared and i can't seem to get it back =)

Here's what my prompt looks like:
(HP:181 MV:199 MA:317)>
(Note: There is a space after the > )

Here's how I'm assigning the HP and MA values to a variable:
/def -f -mregexp -t"^\(HP:([^ ]*) MV:([^ ]*) MA:([^ ]*)\)> $" hp_mana_hook =
\
        /set hp=%P1%; \
        /set move=%P2%; \
        /set mana=%P3

How can I do this and still have it show up in my prompt?  The way it works
now, the variables get set correctly but my prompt disappears.

Thanks,

Charles

Hmm, I have no idea how to do that but maybe you could improvise; create a
trigger that reports your stats every second (only to yourself so
other players won't become flooded). Then use /gag command not to show
those reports even to yourself. Use the /gag-command same way as you
use /def and get the stats into variables and do with them what you
wanted to do. I'm not sure if you can get text from screen into variables
with /gag but maybe someone else knows ?

use the -g tag on your trig definition to get the triggered text gagged,

if i were you, which i think i'm not, i'd use the status_line to keep
track of hp and mana on the status_fields variable (set visual on and
check out /help status_lines) I do see certain situations where using
visual mode might be a disadvantage, but hey, you can always get over
those...

/help prompts

Basically, you do not want to trigger a line that looks like that -
you want to trigger a _prompt_ that looks like that. That is done by
using the PROMPT hook - or you might just want to have a linefeed in
your prompt, if possible, so the values end up on a different line
that can be triggered separately.

And what you would really want to do is to ask the mud admins to code
in a feature to the heartbeat that shows the hp/sp/etc. every time
there is a tick or they change, whichever.

   You asked this a while ago, but I didn't see any answer..

  Yes, you can do this.. You define it as a hook, probably
something like

/def -mglob -h'SEND start*' = /send Started..

  It's a little more tricky, but it's quite possible..

I found out what was stripping the spaces off seems a
trigger like /def -mregexp -t'^.*' getline = \
/test echo({*})

you loose all the spaces if any from the left side on. How can I get the
real line that was captured ?

Assign priorities to the triggers, and make sure that the trigger which
wants the space intact has a higher priority than the macro which strips
the space.

See:
 /help def -p
 /help priority

try this:

/def -mglob -t"*" t_catch = \
	/test fwrite("filename",{*})


remember this:

all substitutions remove the preceding spaces

if you use test it shouldn't happen

It's not a perminate trigger, just temporay to catch like a who list or
something similiar.
Then it's turned off. But I have to catch each line into a string variable so
I can modify it
before writing it to disk.

Would it be possible to create a trigger which catches something, then
from there, create a counter in the status_line? In DragonRealms
(though, that's not important, I suppose) on many actions, you're
returned a "roundtime" which informs you how long you must wait before
you can do your next action. It would be nice if I could get that
number, then have an RT counter which I can watch countdown. I realize
there would be some minor CPU hit for this, but it might be nice.

Create the trigger, put it in a variable.  Read "/help status_line"
which describes use of status_fields.  There is a lot of help available
there.

/help repeat

Define a macro which decrements the variable and, if not zero, schedules
itself to execute once, after a delay.  In the trigger, define the
variable and invoke the macro after a delay (again, using repeat).

Does this make sense?  Or have I misinterpreted your spec?

fwrite() does not strip spaces.  You must've lost the spaces in the
value before passing it to fwrite().  Without seeing your code, I can
only guess that positional parameters (like {1} and {*}) are the most
likely culprit.  Positional parameters do not preserve leading and
trailing spaces.

Eh, I feel fairly foolish, I suppose. I got it to work.

/def -F -p99 -ahCyellow -mregexp -t"^[>]*[\[]*Roundtime"
    
/def -F -p98 -mglob -t"\[Roundtime {*} sec.\]" blah = /set X=%2%;/doDec 
   
/def -E'$[X]' doDec = /repeat -w -00:00:01 $[X] /updateRT             
/def updateRT=/set X=$[--X]%;/set RT=RT: $[X] 

Took me as such. Does this seem reasonably clean to you? If so.. I
have another question. Why is that the -p99 def there for highlighting
doesn't actually work? It works when the trigger isn't there... Should
I somehow be combining the two together?

try this:
general countdown macro: use: /countdown varname
/def countdown = \
	/if (test(%1)>0) \
	   /test --%1%;\
	   /repeat -1 1 /countdown %1%; \
	/endif%;

/def -t"\[Roundtime ([0-9]+) sec\.\]" -mregexp \
	/set X=%P1%;\
; for one second delay of countdown :)
	/repeat -1 1 /countdown X%;

/set status_fields=X:3

Hope it helps

I've tried using all my mad C skills to modify the tf source to do this
but I'm lost.  I bow before you and humbly request that you help me out
with this!

It would be terrific if we could specify, when logging, that the log
output be in 'raw' format instead of black-and-white (when your
emulation is ansi_attr (which is preferable)).

There is a great need for raw log output for posting battles on the
internet after running them thru an ansi2html converter.

Thanks,
Jeff Billimek

have several things i want to do, but have not figured a way to
accomplish with tf.  anyone have any suggestions on these?

1) matching text over multiple lines

an example:

on the main mud i play, room contents are just appended to the room
desc, like so:

blah blah blah blah blah.  You also see ...

where everything after 'You also see' until a period will be contents.
however, because of the way it wraps text, this could end up being
broken in somewhere in the middle, so i might have 'You\nalso see' or
'You also\nsee'.  i would like to hilite everything in that sentence,
irregardless of line breaks.  is this possible?  i tried this:

/def -Fp0 -P0Cgreen -mregexp -t'You[ \10\13]also[ \10\13]see[ \10\13][^.]+\.'

but that does not seem to work

2) gagging text that matches pattern a but does not also match pattern
   b

i'd like to gag messages about people entering or leaving the mud
unless they happen to be people i watch for. the two relevant defs i
have are:

/def -Fp99 -P0Ccyan -mregexp -t'xxxx|yyyy|zzzz|aaaa' hilite_friends
/def -Fp0 -ag -mglob -t'enters the game' gag_enters

this doesn't work.  if i removed the fallthrough from hilite_friends,
it will work, but other triggers/hilites fail.  i have found setting
the priority of hilite_friends below everything but gags, and making
it not fall through works:

/def -p1 ... hilite_friends

is this the optimal way of doing this?

3) is there away to prevent gagging from sending a blank line to
   tfout?

while gagging is nice for getting rid of a lot of screen clutter, it
still does cause scroll.  is there a fix for this?

(quick explanation for those who don't play: DragonRealms is a rather
large commercial mu* (generally 500-1200 players on at any given time)
run by Simutronics, who, unfortunately, are very poor at supporting
any sort of *ix (their answer is to use WINE and run the windows
software))

after endless frustration at cutting and pasting login keys from
netscape and trying to get WINE to work, i finally decided to come up
with a better way of logging in to DR.  thanks to tcpdump, i was able
to see how their software gets the login keys, and replicate the
process.  i've thrown together a simple perl script that will return a
login key that can then be fed to the server (/quote is wonderful for
this).  if there are any DR players who use tf who'd be interested in
this, feel free to contact me.

Ob. tf question:  is there any way to gag just part of a line?  or do
any sort of replacement on incoming text?  the only way i can think of
doing something like this is along the lines of:

/def -p1000 -ag -mglob -t'*foo*' turn_foo_to_bar = \
  /echo %{P1}bar%{P2}%; \
  /trigger %{P1}bar%{P2}

which will, i think, work, and fire triggers, but i believe it fails
to activate hilites.  any thoughts?

I'm curious if there's any current method, or thought to a method, for
providing scrollback functionality without something as kludgy as
doing a /more on, /recall -w <somenumber>, then paging down through
the history. Perhaps a bit more like an editor window, or the paradigm
I was thinking of, ircII. I'd basically just like to hit page up, get
the last page, hit it again, get the page before that, then be able to
go back down... It may already be there, but if it is, it's not
obvious to me.

Depending on your operating system / terminal program, you might already
have this is in the form of shift-pageup/shift-pagedown to scroll back and
forward.  Another variation is if you happen to run tf through screen (a
great combination!) you can access screen's scrollback buffer using
ctrl-a+esc, which puts you into a vi-ish navigation/cut&paste scheme, use
'i' or 'esc' again to get out.

Well, shift-pgup and pgdn is a solution, but it's not quite as nice as
I'd like. Rxvt tends to have some somewhat questionable behavior with
respect to it's scrollTtyOutput resource's behavior. I hadn't bothered
to try to use the screen option... This option is probably the
most viable and I think does what I want. However, I still wonder if
this should be done at the application level, rather than at the
terminal level.
Thanks for the tips!

Tinyfugue does lot's of fun stuff with streams of ansi... lots of line
wrapping and breaking up the image(s). Any way around this?

Well you could always use a GUI frontend to tf ... such as Crescendo.
Needs work.. but is useable.. though could do with more users/developers.

Website.. not sure off top of head... but should be listed under gnome 
software

http://www.gnome.org/applist/listrecent.php3?category_query=Network%20Talk%20Clients%20(IRC/ICQ/etc)

Filtered atm by my ISP .. gah!!

Aye, this would be another option as well. However, one of the reasons
I use tf is that I desire and, to a certain extent, require a non-GUI
client. I have checked out Crescendo, though, and it certainly does
the job, but I'm  still somehwat convinced that tf could probably use
this functionality inline, since it has most of the pre-requisites in
there already; a history, the ability to page down.. It seems to be
just missing the crucial ability to scroll back up through the
history.
I'm beginning to think I'm kind of alone though.

You're not.  A couple of years back, before I unsubscribed, someone was
asking for this.  The guy who wrote the irc.tf stuff, I think.

He was saying something about VT100 (?) control codes for handling this.
I think that I was rude to him.  Oops.

Search waaaay back in archives.  :^)

Yah, I think alot of us are in that boat :-)

But understanding that Ken has both a real job, and a life, I suppose I can
be patient for him to get around to it :-)

Anyways, I poked through the code briefly looking at this a while back.
It's not impossible in the 4.0 code, but it's really not very friendly when
in /visual mode.

The old job thing. Tis quite a pain.
Well, it would be nice if this functionality were eventually
supported. I think it's pretty nifty and would probably end up helping
as many people as I originally imagined.
If it didn't require curses programming, which tends to lead me to
curses, I would consider developing some patches in my copious spare
time, but if the thought might be to re-write the visual engine, it
might not be worth it. There seem to be a number of other issues I've
run in to that aren't related to scrollback, but I'm not positive
whether they may be terminal related. 
I often get "bleeding" of ANSI bold characters on my display, which I
don't think are related to the server, but could very well be rxvt
mucking up. The server sends some ANSI to bold things, but after a
little too much of it, next to everything turns bold and I can then
get rid of it by setting emulation to be ansi_strip. I verified I get
this issue with a number of terminals, so... perhaps it isn't just
rxvt.

I was wondering if it would be possible to have it set up in kbbind.tf (I 
think thats the file), so when you call something up in your buffer, 
whatever you have typed out goes to the back (end) of the buffer.  So that 
way, I can scroll through stuff in the buffer... know what I mean? :}

I searched all the documention and webpages available.. and no luck.

I'm using FreeBSD 4.2, and for some reason tiny.fugue messes up repeat.
No matter what time interval you give it, it returns instantly. Even the 
examples in the documention return at once. Even if you..

/repeat -01:10:50 50 /echo hello!

It will repeat hello! 50 times instantly.

Anyone ran into this problem yet?

I just briefly installed tinyfugue on a machine running 4.3-RC.
I used the ports collection to do so.  (/usr/ports/net/tinyfugue/).

Worked correctly for me.

How did you build tinyfugue?  Manually?  If so, try deleting it then do
"make install && make clean" from the ports collection.

That's funny, several versions ago `-0' quit working, and the smallest
time I got that way was 1 second.  I have to say -0:00:00 to get 0 seconds.

My stupidity in the matter is now clear. I appreciate all the responces
on this active list, the reason repeat was returning instantly, was some
where in my 40k file full of macros in triggers, i had the line..

/set lpquote=on

I had forgotten this, and now I know thats the reason for the strange and 
odd behaviour of /repeat that I was not expecting. I needed lpquote on to
make certain things work, but now I'll just turn it on when I need it.

So, incase another idjit such as myself asks this question in the future,
we know the answer. :)

/def -p1000 -t"foo" -mregexp -F turn_foo_to_bar = \
	/substitute %{PL}bar%{PR}

should do it, it discards the original line and substitutes it with the
bar-line, lower prio triggers are called with this substituted line as the
trigger is fallthrough (-F)

Is there a list of what works and what doesn't under the Windows version? I
downloaded my config files from my shell account where I usually run it. When I
tried to start tf, it gave an invalid path error and didn't load anything my
.tfrc specified. Also, when I tried looking at some of the help files, I found
that the tab key doesn't work for more paging, and that many of the editting
keys don't seem to work either, giving me a % dokey or % DOKEY error, saying no
editing function <functionname>

I think I have the path error figured out, since the install doesn't put quotes
around the directory in the autoexec.bat file, which can be a problem if there's
a space in the directory name, ie Program Files. I will have to reboot to verify
this.

Has anyone found a way to hack multiple status lines into tiny.fugue? I would 
rather /set isize=1 than have 3 status lines to work with, than vise versa.

In my experience, almost everything works under the Windows version as lo=
ng=20
as you don't try doing any shelling, although it's a little flaky about=20
deciding when to wake up for incoming text. I've got plenty of complex co=

and trigger and bind settings in my .tfrc, and they all work identically =
on=20
linux (at work) and Win2K (at home) versions.

More likely it's directory names that are the problem, so all your /loads=
 and=20
such are failing.=20

My TF batchfile at home looks like this (obviously, I installed TF in=20
e:\win\tf):

  set HOME=3De:\win\tf\
  e:
  cd \win\tf
  tf-40g1

Then my .tfrc starts off like this:

  ; cheap way to tell if we're in Linux, change to your home.
  /if (HOME=3D~"/user/sizer" )
      /load ~/personal/worlds
      /set TFLIBDIR=3D/user/sizer/bin/tf-lib
  /else
      /load worlds
     /set TFLIBDIR=3D//e/win/tf/tf-lib
  /endif

  /load kbstack.tf

You have the problem identified :-)

On windows 9x, the installer on the druware.com website fails to modify the
TFLIBDIR= line in the autoexec.bat properly.

it should translate the path from the Windows format into the the CygWin
style path.  It doesn't on 9X.

There is a newer installer on www.wilburware.net that correctly addresses
this.

If you examine the druware.com website you should find this following
reference regarding this issues as well:

Before building TinyFugue on any version of Windows, you will need to
install the CygWin development tools. Once they are installed a standard
unix build will do the trick. You will probably want to manually adjust your
configuration to put it in paths that are more comfortable under Windows.
As a post build process, you will need to make sure the the environment
variables for TFLIBDIR and HOME are set so that TF can load properly. Bear
in mind that while the HOME path can be in the Windows native format,
TFLIBDIR MUST be in the CygWind Psuedo Unix path format. What in the heck
does that mean? instead of c:\tf-40s1\tf-lib it should be
//c/tf-40s1/tf-lib.

I am unable to get a /repeat to work at all.
/def sneak=/repeat -wn 30 sneak%;vis
Should set it so that /sneak will repeat sneak and vis 30 times...i know
this you know this, but the TF don't know this.  (/repeat -wn 30
sneak%;vis by itself with the the /def sneak wont work either.  Nor will
just /repeat -wn 30 sneak)
I use SecureCRT to goto an account that has TF on mudz.org
It USED to work, but that was with the version before he upgraded to 4.0
stable 1
I told him about this and he said that he uninstalled/reinstalled it 3
times but couldn't figure out WHY it was going wrong.
HELP :-(

Thanks,
Jason

I'm using the speedwalk.tf supplied with tinyfugue, and need to modify it
a little, but I can't understand the code.
I need to send the command "brief" to the server before starting to
speedwalk, and the same command again when finished. But I only
want to send it if moving through more than one room, and I want
to check the reply from the final invocation of the brief command, to insure
it says "disabled" and not "enabled" and invoke the brief command
again if it doesn't return the expected result.

  If the return from the "brief" command is anything other than
"enabled" or "disabled", like maybe "Brief enabled." that can set them
aside from anything else that might say enabled I would first implement
a variable that just holds the state of brief. Quite easily something
like

/def -F -i -mregexp -t'^Brief enabled\.' loc_trig_briefon = \
        /set output_brief=on

/def -F -i -mregexp -t'^Brief disabled\.' loc_trig_briefoff = \
        /set output_brief=off

  Then modify speedwalk.tf as follow (Pipe indicates original line,
greater than indicates inserted line, minus indicates modified line.)

|/def -i ~do_speedwalk = \
|    /let _args=%*%;\
|    /let _string=%;\
|    /let _count=%;\
|    /let _c=%;\
|    /let _i=-1%;\
>    /if ( %output_brief =~ 'off' ) brief %; \

  If you don't use speedwalk all the time, and mostly in
aliases etc., I would recommend taking a look at /do_path
in the map.tf package, which I prefer over speedwalk, partly
because of the greater freedom of movement commands.. 
(Or any commands for that matter..)

I was wondering how would i write a macro that would continuously pick
up and drop something from/to inventory (d 12, g 1 is what the commands
are).
When something emerges i would need the letter h to be sent continuously
until the monster is killed

d 12
g 1
* emerges from the shadows!
h
h
h
h
h
You destroy the *
d 12
g 1

Now, there are a few monsters that i DONT want to fight, because of
certain reason, and I already have a trigger to make me run to another
room and back (which resets the monster).  So the macro would need to be
able to see that the triggers take priority over the h's

anybody able to help me?

Thanks :-)

I have bound my numpad keys to commands such as north,west,south and east.
Example:    /def -b'^[Or]' = south .  I am now trying to bind ctrl-numpad2
to open south and alt-numpad2 to unlock south .

I just can't seem to figure out what the Character string or symbolic
keyname is for these key combinations.

Any and all help appreciated and Thank you in Advance.

ok... what's the command again to do:
pset %player red 200
and so on? the list i want is red purple blue green yellow and i can't stand
typing that in every time. how would i tell tinyfugue to :
pset player, insert th enext element out of ht elist and send it and another value (200)? all on one line?
like: 
pset rod red 200
pset rod green 200
that is annoying to type.

It might be helpful if you gave an example of a gag definition that is
causing problem.  Otherwise, it is difficult for people to know what
you are talking about.

sorry, here goes:

If you use /gag *spam* where spam is some annoying spammy message
and that message appears like:

-> Omar tells you 'blabla'
->
->
-> Oscar tells you 'xyz'
->
->
-> spam spma spam spam
->
->
-> You reply 'xyz'
->
->
-> xy tells you '..'
...

if you have gaged the line with spam you will get 4 empty lines in a row.
is there a way to cut away the two extra empty lines that come with the
unwanted message?

Along the lines for getting rid of the spaces for gags...
I usually mud on 2 or 3 different worlds at a time.
I have several triggers that activate in a row at times, how do i gag
the text:
% Trigger in world fantasymuse
% Trigger in world fantasymuse
% Trigger in world fantasymuse

Yeah, i know i put it in 3 times, but that is the way that it normally
looks because i have a trigger that activates another trigger which
activates anotehr trigger
A normal /gag don't work because it's not output form the mud but from
TF.
So in order not to spam anyone world with the msgs, i usually run 2 or 3
windows at a time.
Here are the examples of some of the triggers, in case they are needed.

/trig *Black Dragon has arrived*=f dragon
/trig *Decaying Zombie has arrived*=f zombie
/trig *Ouch! You just got murdered by*=home

Thanks,
Jason

Yeah, those are annoying...=20

/trig <pattern>=3D<body>   is the same as /def -t<pattern> =3D <body>

Sticking a -q in the /def should make it shaddup, so
  /def -q -t"*Black Dragon has arrived*"=3Df dragon

Is there anything you can think of that should be added?

I currently have this trigger:

/def -p1 -mregexp -t'You gain (.*) hit points, (.*) mana, (.*) moves,
and (.*) practices.' level=ft @M<-:->@RL@BE@CV@GE@YL@M<-:->@w - Stats
raised by: @W%P1/%P2/%P3/%P4@w%;/down

Which basically sends a msg to my friends list when i level along with
the stats that i got.
But when anyone in my clan does this:

Bizi (Wizard) tells the CLAN: 'You gain 27 hit points, 17 mana, 6 moves,
and 7 practices.'

It sets off the triggers, making my friends all say congrats to me then
i have to tell them that it wasnt ME leveling but someone in my clan who
either doesn't know how to code a proper trigger or is using plain old
telnet.

What I would like is a way to have the trigger know that it is mud
output and not someone else.  Or have it not work with text coming
before it, since when the msg appears there IS no text before it.
There are a few other triggers that i have that have this same problem.
Any help would be apprectiated.

Thanks,
Jason

Just use the ^ anchor at the beginning of the text indicating that there
is no text before the You
-t'^You gain ...'

Easy.  You're using regular expressions, so just 'anchor' the pattern
matching to the start of the line, by inserting a caret (^) at the start
of the pattern: -t'^You gain

Try:
 /help regexp
and read it all.  This anchoring is described in the fourth paragraph of
"REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX"; the caret matches the null (empty) string
at the start of the input string.

$98,730.00 MINIMUM PAYOUT TO YOU
Buy BBPs leads one time to promote your business and receive weekly
commission checks over and over. Thats what our members are doing. They
make a one-time purchase and we pay them weekly for the other orders we
make after them. We are in the leads and promotional business. We run all
promotions and pay all our members for supporting us by buying our leads
one time. Your job is to buy our leads one time. That is your only job.
Our job is to promote those leads to make new orders and pay you
commissions on those orders. This is all happening as you read this
e-mail. There is a good chance you are receiving this e-mail because you
have been promoting a program through the Internet. Why not get paid for
all the leads you and your downline use? If you and the people around you
want to join a real program that is successful, and paying its members,
read the information below and join us now. This program is working for
many people and it can work for you. This program works because our
product is leads. The program promotes itself within. The program is being
built by its own product, LEADS. Dont keep doing what youre doing. This
is your opportunity to join a really financially productive program and
achieve what you have always wanted, an extra income.

We are a large  MLM Leads list company.
We design & run MLM programs to promote the sale of our leads.
Simply MLM is our newest program.
For a one-time purchase of a years supply of mail, fax, phone, or e-mail
leads you will be paid:
$50 commissions on your 2nd level = $450.00

This program can help to promote the program that you are currently
working or promote the sale of our leads. And also MAKE YOU SOME GOOD
EXTRA MONEY.
If you join Simply MLM, BBP will mail you 100 leads of your choice for one

Your only requirement is to send your Simply MLM sales circular to those
leads until three orders are made. Or you can opt. to let BBP send your
leads for you each month for a small additional fee. ( check the
appropriate box @ the bottom of the page ) Once three orders are made with
your sales circular we will contact you and if you want to stop sending
your sales circular or drop BBPs promotional service you can. BBP will
then take over your downline and mail you a commission check  weekly for
the commission schedule stated above. We have been designing MLM programs
for some time now. We try and make them as simple & productive for our
members as we can. I dont know how we could make this one any simpler.

oops? I'm guessing this has something to do with fixing the problem with some of
the recent spam sent through the mailing list?

Hi. I am new at this list and dont know how many read it..

I used tf in the early 92-93 and found it nice, and now I started to
use it again when I started tu use Linux again...

To the problem....

I start tf in the visual mode with isize set to 1. I have the statusbar set 
to an emacs like one(reverse and empty). WHen I connect to a mud it looks 
like this:

I use TF in a rxvt widow and use Mandrake 8 and Xfree 4 (missed anything)

__________________TF WINDOW_____________

output area

[ STATUS BAR                                                     ]
[input area					  ]
__________________________________________

The problem is that the prompt sent from the mud pass the
input area for every thing sent to me. That means that When I do for example 
the command 'score' it can look like this:

INPUT:  [* HP:Fine > sco              ] (Starting to write 'score')
INPUT:  [                                     ] (Here the mud send me a line)
INPUT:  [ * HP:Fine > score           ] (I finish my input and press enter)
INPUT:  [                                     ] (small delay)
INPUT:  [ Ok.                               ] (The mud have seen the command 	
                                                    and send score to output)
INPUT:  [ * HP:Fine >                    ] (Ready for input again)

As you see it gets quite 'jumpy'... I myself who have an eye disorder feel
that this jumpiness is quite hard to look at. I rather have *ALL* output in 
the output window, including the prompt and the only thing seen in the input 
area should be my ... input.

I tried different settings like /lp=on , /clearfull and /cleardone, but the 
problem is not solved. Is there any way to solve this? A solution can be to 
have visual off and use another window as input and send the tf window via a 
fifo.. But thats the hard way I guess and should only take away some 
jumpiness and not the one echoing in the output...

Any help or advice is appreciated.

Thanks

hey,

  I believe there are atleast two solutions to ur problem.
I've had the same one myself, and the solution I'm using is
pretty easy, use the command on the mud to set your prompt
(if there is one), just use the default one but add a new
line on the end.=20

  if this results in unwanted empty lines on the screen
add this:
/def -ag -mregexp -t'^$'

  the other solution would be to make a trigger on your
prompt and gag it. nah seriously, use /substitute on it,
and echo it to the screen maybe would work. haven't tried
tho.

Hi orange. Thanks for your input.

I don't think I described the problem.. The prompt itself is a problem, but 
together with the cursor changing focus every time something happens it
jumps up and down. If I have a prompt saying

"* HP:Bad S W >"

and if I stand there doing nothing, every time someone enter room, narrate 
or do anything that echoes to me from the mud , the cursor change focus to 
output window, the prompt I had in input window "jumps" to output window and 
the line echoed is shown after that. then the cursor jumps back to input 
line, I
get a new prompt there and cursor back to notmal place (passing start of 
line), so its a lot of jumping made by the cursor changing focus together 
with the prompt coming and dissapearing as described below.

Well, after a few days of fruitless attempts at figuring this out on my
own... I've finally decided to break down and ask for help. :>

I'm an avid logger, when it comes to my online RPGs. However, I find
the task of going through my logs to remove comm chatter and whatnot
horribly tedious. A friend of mind passed me a shell script that will
clean up logs.. but what I'd _really_ like is for tf to do this for me.

Unfortunately... I can't seem to find a way to get it to work! /log
doesn't seem to have anything built-in. I thought to use a combination of
gag and /echo (since /log -w doesn't log tf output, just world output),
but /log doesn't seem to care when it's in -w mode if the text is gagged
or not. Even norecord won't -completely- gag something--it's still logged
even if it doesn't show up in the history.

Surely, I'm not the only one ever to face this difficulty. If you've
got any ideas/input/solutions, I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks in advance,

Lori

Hoi All!

I have several questions about TF (i'm sure i've already forgot half of
them):

(Ehm, sorry for the long post.)

1)  How can I gag TF's own messages like:
% Logging to file foo.log

% untrig: Trigger on "^Worn" was not defined.

% "More" paging enabled.  Use TAB to scroll.

2)  How can I make TF to think that I *typed* something?  For example I
bound the keypad keys to walk (8-north 5-south 4-west etc).  But when I
use it TF thinks that I havent read the output so pager comes and I have
to press the TAB key continously...  This is very disturbing, so I did a

/bind ^[Ot = /more off%; w%; /more on

(I turn off more before walking and turn back on after.)  This solves
the problem, but now I see "% "More" paging enabled.  Use TAB to
scroll." message all the time (see question #1 :-)).

But this solution isnt as good as i want it be, imagine the following
situation: I bound my . (keypad) key to "/send note" (this command
displays a note on my mud), so I can read notes fast and comfortably by
pressing the dot key.  But the pager comes at the wrong momment most of
the time.  When I dont use '.' but type note, the pager will stop
scrolling at the top of the message, so I can read it easily (if the
message is longer than 1 screen of course).  But when I use '.' the
pager stops scrolling at my previous typed-by-hand command or at the
last time I pressed tab etc.  So the question again: how can I make TF
to thing that I typed something (or how can i reset the scroll to the
actual line).  /more off%; /more on seems a good idea but i think there
may be a better solution.

3) Speedwalks: all of us know that TF's command separator is '%;', I'm
searching for a macro or something which can interpret commands
separated by ';' so i can use speedwalks from other ppl ;-) like:

/doit run 2su; open w; w; etc...

4) I want TF to echo *every* command sent to the mud.  For examle if I
execute my alias 'wregen'

/alias wregen = wake%; run 2su%; sleep leaf

I want to see the commands:
wake
run 2su
sleep leaf
(possibly with a color I choose)

Or when I press '8' I want to see:
north

I know I could /echo all commands with the attributes I like, but I dont
want to do this with all my aliases / binds / triggers etc.

Hmm, thats all for now, thanks for your answers / ideas / hints in
advance.

What happening here is that TF is turning more off then more on, then sending your
"w" to the mud.  TF doesn't send stuff to the mud until the macro is completed.
You need to use triggers.  You make a macro that turns off more, then that same
macro creates a trigger that gets called when it sees "w". then you send the "w",
the trigger then calls more off, so like this.

/bind ^[Ot = /more off% \
                    /w%;\
                      /def -mregexp -F -t'w' wtrigger = \
                      /undef wtrigger%%;\
                      /more off;\

I don't know why you just don't turn more off perminate when you're connect to the
mud, make less headaches for you.

use TF speedwalk.tf in the tinyfuge lib directory. then do a /load speedwalk.tf
look at the speedwalk.tf code for instructions on how to use.

Hi.
While making multiple line catcher i've met such problem.
For example i want to catch line that has word 'hits you'.
I create good trigger. The second part is that i want to get next line
after that containing 'hits you'. I tried it to do in that way, but it
doesnt work:

/def -mglob -t'*hits you*' trig1 = /eval /set var1 %{*}%;second_trig

/alias second_trig /def -t'*' trig2 = catch_it %{*}

/alias catch_it /undef trig2%;/eval /set var2 %{*}

It doesnt work cause var2 is an empty variable. That's because it's not
taken from trig2 def but it goes feom second_trig alias. Is that a way to
tell TF to take variable from just turned on def, not from alias?
I've tried to make it by recall but it complicates work a lot..

K.

Use %% instead of % to defer its meaning from the outer macro to the nested
macro.  Ie., use %%{*} in trig2.

Also, your code can be improved in several ways:
1. the /evals are unnecessary and dangerous.
2. the aliases should be macros.  (Aliases are useful for commands you call
   manually, but you shouldn't use them for commands you call from a macro.)
3. the bodies of second_trig and catch_it can be put directly in the body of
   their callers.
4. trig2 can undefine itself with the -n1 option instead of /undef.

/def -mglob -t'*hits you*' trig1 = \
    /set var1 %{*}%; \
    /def -n1 -t'*' trig2 = \
        /set var2 %%{*}

This can't be gagged, but you may be able to do what you want with fwrite() or
tfopen()/tfwrite()/tfclose() instead of /log.

This can be avoided by using
  /def untrig-q = /if /ismacro -msimple -t%{*}%; /then /untrig %{*}%; /endif
  /untrig-q ^Worn

This can be avoided by using "/set more on" instead of "/more on".

Turning more off and on resets the line counter.  But you wouldn't want
to turn more off if you were _already_ at a more prompt.  You can test
for that using %moresize.

  /def reset_more = /if (moresize == 0) /set more off%; /set more on%; /endif

...then use "/reset_more" to reset the more counter.

/def doit = /eval $[replace(';', '%;', {*})]
(There are more efficient ways to do it, but this is one of the simplest.)

This will echo any commands sent by typing or implicitly sent by macros
(including aliases), but not explicitly by /send or send():

/def -q -hsend -p0 echo_send = /echo sending: %*

(Aliases are implemented as send hooks with priority 1, so echo_send needs to
be priority 0.)

Is there a way to get two of more status lines on
tf, or one status line that can use newline chr? I've
been having problems fitting all the data I want
to have on the status line into just one line.

Hello,

I am lookinf for a way to color only certain words and not complete lines. 
For example I would like to highlight directions and if the mud sends me

There are three exits: north, east, west.

Only the 3 words "north", "east" and "west" should be highlighted.

Usually I use triggers with the -a switch but this highlights the whole 
line in the given color. Is there a way to color only the given words?

Thanks in advance,
        Harry

you can't, as far as I know, double or triple the status line in the current
version of tf. but depending on how much you need to add you might find
increasing it's width useful. I'm using a 90 width terminal now and can fit
in all my relevant information including dropping things like ":" from
labels, ie. "hp201" instead of "hp: 201", and using the terminal title to
display the brief name of the room I'm in (using an terminal that
understands xterm messages, check the /XTITLE macro).

   Use -P for partial..

Like 


/def -i -msimple -Pagreen -t'west' hi_west


  Well, you get the idea..

download--and I am trying to address some shortcomings of the Apple 
Terminal.  ANSI colors are supported, but it doesn't allow 
customization of these colors.  So, ANSI black on a black background 
is unreadable, as is ANSI white on a white background.  The terminal 
itself supports quite a number of colors, so I think I may be able to 
adjust tinyfugue's settings to manually display a color when the ANSI 
code is received.  Can any other OS X tinyfugue users provide some 
input?

I have XFree86 running as well, but it's a much less attractive alternative.

Thanks,
Chris

Hi, I'm new to this mailing list, so I think I'll introduce myself, also
because I haven't received any message, yet.
I'm an italian boy who likes playing MUDs, and I think that tf is the
better MUD client under UNIX =)

When I saw it for the first time, I thought I was watching something rough
like telnet, but /help changed my mind...
Then slowly I've learned how to script it (and how to love it :-P), and now
.tfrc + other *.tf made by me are about 40 kb :-)
Finally I joined this ML hoping to read something interesting.

Anyway is TinyFugue still under development?
I can see that the latest release is dated 1999...


Bye

(I have made a nogag-q version of this function, i've simply changed
/untrig to /nogag.)  This solution doesn't handle well arguments with
multiple words.  For example I can't get "/ungag-q ^Extra flags"
working. :-(

Thanks in advance for your answers.

While I'm sure that speed is not particularly an issue given cpu 
speeds, I was wondering which was the most efficient way to exactly 
match the following string:

A female griffon
(or)
A male griffon

A few I came up with:

/def -aCyellow -mregexp -t"^A (fe)?male griffon$"
/def -aCyellow -mregexp -t"^A (female|male) griffon$"
/def -aCyellow -mglob -t"A {female|male} griffon"

In general glob is supposed to be fastest(according to the helps); is 
there any easy way to test these vs. one another for speed? I have 
some 1500 trigs now, and though I have no real cpu problems, I have 
been thinking about efficiency issues.

Tired and bored,

Andrew

Well, a year ago as I believe we got a discussion on a list about it. I'm
wondering whether somebody made it (under linux if possible)- you know,
you're sending some password to a friend, declaring you're the rite person,
then all the messegaes to that person (let's say tells) are sending in code,
the other side is decoding it. *shrug*, I just hate when imms and actually
everyone can listen to what I'm talking about. Anyone has such a thing?

If you (and the one you are talking to) have openssl installed you could
use the following macros:

/def -Fp999999 -mregexp -t'C{{{([A-Za-z0-9+/=3D_]+)}}}C' rc4trig =3D \
  /echo -p - @{Cbgwhite}@{Cblack}$(/rc4decrypt %{P1})@{n}
/def rc4encrypt =3D \
  /quote -S /echo - !echo '%{*}' | openssl enc -e -base64 -rc4 -k  %{cryptk=
ey} | tr '\\n' '_'
/def rc4decrypt =3D \
  /quote -S /echo - !echo '%{*}' |tr '_' '\\n' | openssl enc -d -base64 -rc=
4 -k %{cryptkey}
/alias rc4tell tell %{1} C{{{$(/rc4encrypt %{-1})}}}C

Both you and the one you want to talk securely to must have those macros,
and a common %cryptkey. I'll let you figure out how you can agree securely
on which key to use.

Well speaking as an Arch on a MUD that has issues with this very thing, it
can get a little dicey.  We've gone to removing any imm that uses this kind
of methodology in game.  We know they are going to do it via the IM's but
private conversations that ware secured make it too easy to give out imm
info about mortals to players in the game. *shrug*


That said, Shouldn't this be fairly easy? the only difficulty would be
making sure that both users had it configured

If you don't trust the imms, don't go to that place, or at least don't
speak such things there. It's such a simple thing to do (or not do as
the case may be).

Ooh it's very stupid advice as for me. sometimes you've got to tell sth
secret to your driend on the MUD, and imms are normal people and they may
want to use information we spread as passwords, some numbers etc. So if we
care for ourselves we are more safe. I think that coding text that was
sent to the mud is very good idea, and answer 'don't speak such things' is
a way for lazy ppl.

A macro to do encrypt/decrypt using pgp (gpg?) would prove useful, but if
you have a problem with the people running the server... don't use the
server.  It is trivial to run your own chat server even on a Windows
machine, and http://nmc.limitless.org will _help_ you do so if it's the
NMC software.  As we tell the people who visit Redwall and Nameless MUCKs
when they complain about policy issues and our enforcement of said
policies: there are six thousand other mucks, go find one you like, or
start one.  We'll even help you get going.  But trying to 'hide' anything
from the guy who's _liable_ for what happens on his equipment is ALWAYS a
bad plan.

Imms that can snoop your descriptor, usually also have access to the mud shell 
so they also have access to the pfiles, they don't need your password because
they can simply remove the old one from your pfile and then load the pfile as a
player .. have their fun then just put the password line back in and you would
never know that they did that. Hell, implementing simple loading of the pfile
and then switching over 'into' it, would take about 30 minutes :)

IMHO instead thinking of way how to encrypt your communication on a mud and
taking the risk of annoying the snoopy imms or swamping the public channels
with nonsense, it would be better to avoid the mud all together and just write
script that would work like DCC chat on irc .. direct connection from player to
player .. then unless the snoopy person is sitting on one of the routers
between you and your friends, they have no way to intercept your chatter ..

	Hi,

I want when I am online to define macro like this:

	/def prac = /sp %; /repeat -10 1 /prac

It has to be defined when when proper condition is true, so I have
something like this:

/def -p1 -mglob -t'You don't enought mana.' = /undef prac %; /sleep
%; /repeat -100 1 /wake %; /def prac = /sp %; /repeat -10 1 /prac %; /prac  

But that do not work if I just type it while I play mud. I want to put my
character to sleep , wake after a while and start doing whatever is
defined under /sp until he spent all his mana. How can I tell to tf what
is new macro in macro?? If I make all this in some file it works fine but
I dont want it that way.
 
				Robert.

Heck, I'd suggest everyone use /set wrapspace 2 - it looks funny at first=

you're not used to it, but it's invaluable in sorting through reams and r=
eams=20
of crap flowing by.

I just dashed that off without considering all cases.  This version will
handle multiple words and quotes:

/def untrig-q = \
    /if /ismacro -msimple -t"$(/escape " %{*})"%; /then \
	/untrig %{*}%; \

I had a problem like yours, for practice without too effort, too... ;-P

I solved by adding a new variable, look there:

  /def -t"*Perdi la tua concentrazione!*" = /if ({pracca} =~ "on") /repeat -4 1 /pratica_casta %; /endif

I'm sorry: it triggers italian text, "Perdi la tua concentrazione" is
something like "You loose your concentration"...
Anyway the mud sends that text when I fail to cast the spell, and I retry
when I practice automatically, in fact when the variable pracca =~ on...

So you could do something like this:


  /set practice on

  /def prac = /if ({practice} =~ "on") /sp %; /repeat -10 1 /prac %; /endif

  /def -t"You don't enought mana." = /set practice off %; /sleep %;/repeat -100 1 /wake_prac

  /def wake_prac = /wake %; /set practice on %; /prac


So when you don't want to practice you don't have to undef, but you have
only to set practice off.
I've done a def for me who automatizes it a bit (I have all in pracca.tf
that is loaded at startup from .tfrc), look that def "translated":

  /def practice = \
        /if ({practice} =~ "off") \
                /set practice on %;\
                /set practice %;\
        /else \
                /set practice off %;\
                /set practice %;\
        /endif

So you just have to type /practice to toggle it.
The second /set practice without an argument is for showing its value.
I think it should be what you want... Or at least it's what I understood
you want :-P

The only real way to test would be to start a tf without any macros,
define one of those triggers above, and measure how long it takes to
/trigger hundreds of thousands of times.  (Trying loops with regmatch()
vs. the =/ operator would not be fair, since triggers save compiled
regexps, but macro bodies do not.)

Testing is easier in tf 5.0 because it provides access to better time
precision and macro bodies do save compiled regexps.  However, 5.0 also
uses a new and presumably faster regexp package, PCRE.  I ran a few
tests on the patterns above in 5.0, and found the two regexps are
roughly equal in performance (as I expected), and the glob is about 30%
faster than the regexps.  The latter result was a bit surprising, since
I expected PCRE to perform well.  But, given this, I would expect the
performance difference between globs and regexps to be even greater in
tf 4 and earlier.

How much longer you think it will be until we all get to see this 5.0, I
would say it's been 3 years in development now.?  Just curious ;)

I must applaud in your choice of PCRE for the regexp package. I
remember posting some long and elaborate mail on the choices of regexp
packages a few years back.

Thank you.

Hi guys,
I'm new to this MailingList.
And for the first mail i have only a - i hope so - simple question.
Has anyone of you a valid EMail-Address from Andreas Sahlbach,
the supporter of the OS/2-Version of TF?

TIA

I  have a world defined like this:

/addworld -T"telnet"        goofey gossamer XXXXX localhost 23

Which,  if I read the docs right, should log me in automatically
but it's not.  Is this possibly because my login screen:

---
mycroft.tertius.net.au

mycroft login: gossamer
Password:
---

Says "mycroft login:" instead of "login:"?

What must I fix to fix this?


Why am I defining a world to telnet to my own system?  It's a
long story mostly connected with the fact that TF doesn't do ssh.
I want TF to ssh to another system so I have to use TF to telnet
to mmy own system then ssh from the prompt.  Messy but it works.

(will 5.0 support ssh?)

Looks like it:

/list -i -T*telnet* -h'LOGIN'

% 63: /def -i -Fp2147483647 -mglob -T'{telnet|telnet.*}' -h'LOGIN ' 
~login_hook_telnet = /def -n1 -ip2147483647 -mglob -w -h'PROMPT login:*' 
~telnet_login_${world_name} = /send -- $${world_character}%; /def -n1 
-ip2147483647 -mglob -w -h'PROMPT password:*' ~telnet_pass_${world_name} = 
/send -- $${world_password}

Note the PROMPT hook.

> What must I fix to fix this?

Redefine ~login_hook_telnet to use a matching PROMPT hook.

sorry i keep asking this, but whats the cmd to do something like:
pset jay {red blue green yellow purple yellow} 200?
that is a list, every thing in the list has to go off, one by one, seperated by a newline; like:
pset jay yellow 200
pset jay red 200
etc.

I have a trigge that catches a number of incoming lines and modifies the
concatenated String. How can I make the resulting lines appearing like
_separate_ lines of text from the mud. That means I want a substitute that
produces more than a single line.

Does anyone have a solution for this?

Thanks, Michael

sure this has been either in pieces of summed on the list a few times. first
off I love tf and can finally run it local and its so sweet. been off the
list for a bit, switching isp's and pc's. but was wondering what features
MIGHT be in 5.0?

right now I run a mccp patched tf source because one mud I play actually
gives extra bonuses for using mccp. anyway over all want to repeat again, tf
is the best mud client going on any platform. (just wish windows treated it
nicer, but it was the one of the main reasons I installed Linux so ;)

Well, based upon what Ken has inferred, future versions of TF should behave
better in Windows, and I'm working on improving that as well :-)

Hoi All!

How can I do case insensitive things?

Like,

,----
| /def -mregexp -t"(.*) can be found in the vicinity of (.*) which" \
|      hilit_quest_target2 = /def -mregexp -t"%P1" -ahf quest_target %;\
|                            /def -mregexp -t"%P2" -ahf quest_target2
`----

and i want the highlight triggers to be case insensitive...

Any hints?

I don't have the original tf with only the MCCP patch applied, but i do have
one with MCCP and MSP both .. you can get the source from
http://home.texoma.net/~dingo

The patch there is only MSP patch for alread MCCP - enabled TF so you want the
source .. it's only about 360k.

I've noticed a trend lately.  (Well, lately being defined as the last several 
years.)  Mud servers are starting to support some more advanced client-server 
protocols.  Some examples of this are:

1) The MCCP compression protocol.

2) SSL encryption.  (I've just integrated an SSL support patch into the 
official TinyMUCK FB6 server source.  It's easy and I forsee other MU*s 
implementing it soon, via OpenSSL.)

3) The MCP client-server communications protocol.  (I implemented it in the 
TinyMUCK FB6 server.  MOO servers have supported it for years.)

This all leads me to a small suggestion:

  It'd be much easier for third-parties to add support to TinyFugue for various 
new protocols, if TinyFugue could support binary plugins/modules.  This would 
also let Ken not have to worry about supporting each new whiz-bang protocol-of-
the-month.

Just a thought to mull over.

I am trying to figure out what might be wrong with this:
The quick run down (or around, as the case may be) is that when Questor
gives me a quest, I activate a speedwalk to the area.

Questor tells you 'Seek the lizard out somewhere in the vicinity'
<--just tells me the mob to kill
% quest1: South_East_Corner_of_Arena_which_is_in_the_general_are: no
such command or macro
Questor tells you 'of South East Corner of Arena which is in the general
area' <--this is gagged. or is it?
Questor tells you 'of The Adventurers Guild.' <---this uses the
/$[replace below and activates the speedwalk

/def -p1 -mregexp -t"^Questor tells you 'of (.*).'" quest1 =/$[replace("
","_",{P1})]
/gag *Questor tells you 'of * which is in the general area'*

Even tho i have the above gag, it STILL tries to read the one that i get
the error for.
The weird thing is that the code says 'of (.*).' but it still tries to
activate on the wrong one and it dont have a .  AND i always see
it..even tho it is gagged...
I would assume that it is taking the Questor tells you 'of  part but
since the WHOLE trigger don't end in a . why the heck is it trying to
read it?...is there a work around?

Another question is how can i get this to work:
Questor issues me a quest and I complete it:
Questor tells you 'As a reward, I am giving you 21 quest points and 100
gold.'
** You gain 3 practices **
I currently do:
ft 21qp & 100g
ft 3 practices
(the ft's are a channel name)
How do i get it to do:
ft 21qp & 100g & 3 practices
NOTE: the ** You gain 3 practices ** is NOT everytime, and is various
different things...ALSO, there might be 2 bonuses given as well:
Questor tells you 'As a reward, I am giving you 21 quest points and 100
gold.'
** You gain 3 practices **
** You gain 1 train **
** You gain 1 Trivia Point **
ft 21qp & 100g
ft 3 practices
(note that the current code does not display the extra stuff that i
got..only the 1st bonus.
This is the code that I have currently:
/def -p1 -mregexp -t"^Questor tells you 'As a reward, I am giving you
(.*) quest points and (.*) gold.'" quest2=ft %P1qp & %P2g%;/def -n1
-p100 -F -t'*' -mglob quest2_1 = /if (regmatch("[*]+ You gain (.*)
[*]+",{*})) ft \%P1\%;/endif

Anyone can help?

TIA,
Jason

I think this regexp is quite wrong... dont you want something like:

"^Questor tells you '[^']* of (.+)\.'"

You need some sort of matchall before the 'of', because there's text
between the quote character and your of. I've said match anything except
another quote character, althrough if there are places with quotes in
them, you might need to do some trickery.

I've also backslashed the dot, so it actually matches a dot, and not just
any character.

Read /help regexp. 'An atom is a regular expression ... `.' (matching any
single character) ...'. So your . after (.*) matches any single 
character. If you want to match '.', escape it with a backslash:
/def -p1 -mregexp -t"^Questor tells you 'of (.*)\.'" quest1 = ...

Your gag is never used since it is defined with priority 0, and the line
it is supposed to catch is caught by your other trigger (quest1). You
have to either fix the trigger or define the gag with a priority greater
than that of the trigger's:
/def -p2 -ag -t"Questor tells you 'of * which is in ...

I use the windows version of tf.  Version 4.0 stable 1.
But the /repeat command don't work what so ever..
Does anyone have a version of the windows version that the /repeat
works?  Or where I can get one?

Thanks
Jason

This is a compression protocol based on the gzip libz library.  It allows users
of slower data links (say, modem users) to get higher effective bandwidth from
the server.  It also reduces the overall bandwidth used by the server, at the
expense of some CPU overhead.  But then, CPU is cheap nowadays.

This lets a client and server communicate out of band so that they can cooperate
to provide better interfaces for the user.  The simplest example of this is the
simple-edit package, which sends text to the client for the user to edit.  Once
the user is done, it sends the edited text back to the server.  This allows
niceties like letting the user use an actual visual editor on muds that normally
only allow line-by-line editing.

The protocol spec is at: http://www.belfry.com/fuzzball/trebuchet/mcp.html

Different version, the one on Druware is an older install, and an older
CugWin.  The WilburWare install is an installation that is still being
tested, so I haven't put it on DruWare yet.  I'm about 90% certain that
the installer works on all platforms now, and that the /repeat and /sys!
Bugs are fixed in it.  At least they don't effect me on my Win2k or XP
boxes.

I made sw aliases like this: i use the w as a prefix, then the first two
letters of the first two words of the area's name (of, the etc doesn't
count), like Wyvern Tower is wyto, so the speedwalking alias is wwyto,
Doom and Gloom is wdogl etc, this very comfortable for me, but i think
it'll be even more combined with your solution. :-)

I think I found a bug in this patch: you can only have one ansi log, even
if you try to log ansi output for more than one world.

I tried this:

  /log -h -wWorld1 world1.log
  /log -h -wWorld2 world2.log

But when I type "/log" I only get:

  % Logging ansi output to world2.log

In fact it logs the output of *every* world in that logfile, not only the
output of World2, but also the World1 one's.

I think that it "thinks" that ansi output is only one kind of output, not

I don't know if I'm right, because I don't know the C language very well

Is it really a bug or I did something wrong somewhere?

	Yeah I noticed that too.  I'll try to change it such that it
copies the world logging style instead of global logging style.

	Another problem I noticed which is really annoying is that it
seems to sometimes make the history buffer 'forget' what commands you
were entering.  I think it has something to do with it using that shared
'outbuf' buffer, but that was the only way I could make it work with
giving the full ansified string that is about to be written to the
screen.  A possibly solution is to duplicate all of the code from
hwrite() and everything it calls that uses the bufput functionality so
avoid stepping on the outbuf String.

	Very frustrating indeed!  I'll let you know when I make those
changes,

-Jeff

I think I found a bug in this patch: you can only have one ansi log,
even
if you try to log ansi output for more than one world.

I tried this:

  /log -h -wWorld1 world1.log
  /log -h -wWorld2 world2.log

But when I type "/log" I only get:

  % Logging ansi output to world2.log

In fact it logs the output of *every* world in that logfile, not only
the
output of World2, but also the World1 one's.

I think that it "thinks" that ansi output is only one kind of output,
not
"world-dependent"...
I don't know if I'm right, because I don't know the C language very well
and so I never whatched the source.

Is it really a bug or I did something wrong somewhere?

Hello Everyone,

I'm writing some macros to automatically set colour hilighting triggers for
all the players on the talker I use.

I have attached the tf file containing the macros at the end of this 
message...

My idea was to:

1) Set up a trigger macro to set colours when player's names appear at the
beginning of the line (with no spaces),

2) Run "who" to actually list all players connected at the moment

3) Then /undef the trigger so that next time I run "who" the colours aren't
redefined (or other words at the beginning of the line are considered to be
player's names!).


I have a couple of problems at the moment:

The first is that if I have the "/undef set_colour_trigger" in the macro
after "who", nothing happens (so I have put it in it's own macro for the
moment).

Anyone know why this is? Should I put some sort of sleep between the "who"
command and the /undef?

Also, I've defined another macro to set colour hilights for players as they
arrive.

On this talker, the connect pattern is the same as the disconnect pattern.
So, I'd like to be able do some sort of "is defined?" macro so players are
only coloured if they do not already have a colour.

Can anyone help me?? Also, these are the first macros I've written so I'd be
glad of any tips to make them better.

Many Thanks.
Ashley

p.s. The "defined" macro in my colour_names.tf file doesn't work.

I think this is a bad idea. I like the available source that tf has. And
pointless binary plugins like you describe will easily lead to crap like
'you must load our plugin into your tf to play our mud'. (And you never
know what that plugin may really do to your system.)

And, having source lets me make changes like my 256-color patch for tf,
and my multiple-hilight patch. (So if you have two hilights on the same
text, one overrides the other instead of the two being mixed by OR'ing the
numbers representing the colors.

BTW, I've offered both of these patches, the 256 color one, about 6 months
ago, and the multi-color one about 2.5 years ago... To no response.

What you want, more sophisticated IO, can be done on the IO side of tf; it
doesn't require binary plugins. IE, have proper support for streams in the
codebase, and do decryption, MCCP, MCP, etc with transducers that take one
stream and create and/or emit to other streams.

Furthermore, cross-platform binary plugins and modules just seems ugly to
me. I somehow get the feeling that plugins will not have the platform
availibility that tf has now. Also, having a consensus for what protocol
is used is a good thing. Its still unbelievable how much
reinventing-the-wheel goes on.

The MUD-Dev ftp site..... has to be seen to be believed.

Um, I think he meant dynamic libraries - ofcourse they technically can
be binary if really someone wants it - but it would be very silly to
have to provide binary plugins for a gazillion platforms. But actually
it depends on the licence if releasing binary-only plugins would be
even accepted.

But I think dynamic libraries would be a good idea - if they could
somehow offer nice things - (like UNIX socket communication etc.)

Well that wouldn't change.

Well true, but these couldn't be implemented in tinyfuguescript could
they? ;) I think it would be nice to have a _separately compiled_ SSL
plugin to use or not use - that it wouldn't be a compile time option
that SSL is linked in always if the support is enabled.

Binary-only distributions seem 100% useless to me. But dynamic library
support could have it's merits. Dynamic library support would not
decrease platform availability. (And if someone really would need a
proprietary plugin, it would be technically feasible).

FWIW, I have a patch to tf that provides SSL support via OpenSSL.  I can
probably distribute it too, now that US export regs are more lenient (for
a little while...).

SSL is different enough that I can't see this ever being supported as a
modular plugin to tf; SSL would act as a wrapper /around/ existing tf
protocol support, requiring more than just a protocol plugin.

In my SSL patch, although the changes are not numerous, they are deep.
Additional options to /connect; changes to the output format of
/listsockets; changes to internal connection structures... it's difficult
to achieve all of this using a plugin API, because most of what
needs/wants changing with the addition of SSL support is stuff that no
other protocol plugin would ever have a use for.

Yes, this is also a persuasive reason.

Also, I don't think SSL can be called a 'new whiz-bang protocol-of-the-month';
SSL/TLS has been in widespread use for years, and OpenSSL is practically a
standard system library on many Linux distributions now.

I'd just like to note that only the encryption algorithm would be
covered by the export regs. You don't need to export those since they're
part of OpenSSL.

Actually, US export regulations also speak to the question of software
that has 'hooks' for cryptography, and in the past, such software was also
subject to export restrictions.  You can argue whether the OpenSSL API
represents 'hooks for strong cryptography', given that it's possible to
negotiate weak SSL encryption using OpenSSL; but I would rather prefer
this debate not take place while I'm the one being harrassed by the US
government. :)

You're using an older version of rxvt, or a derivative thereof.

I recomend getting a more recent copy.

You could also fix the bug yourself.  I did to my copy, several years
ago, but I can't seem to find the patch I made, nor can I remember the
file/whatnot.

   This is because if you undef it right away, the mud won't had time to send
you any of the who data back..
   The best way to solve this is if there is some sort of end of list marker
after all the players have ben listed that you can trigger the /undef with..

   I've solved this here in another way.. If a player is already being colored
they will just redefine themselves, thus not creating duplicates.. The only
possible drawback is that they may change their colouring..

Modified macro follows..

------------- Cut here --------------
;;; A macro to run "who" and set colour hilight triggers for each name
;;; in the list.

;; Global variable for the current colour
/set current_colour=cyan

;; Variable to see if we're currently adding players..
/set colour_it=0

;; Colour cycling state machine...
/def next_colour = \
	/if ( current_colour =~ "red" ) \
		/set current_colour=green%; \
	/elseif ( current_colour =~ "green" ) \
		/set current_colour=yellow%; \
	/elseif ( current_colour =~ "yellow") \
		/set current_colour=blue%; \
	/elseif ( current_colour =~ "blue") \
		/set current_colour=magenta%; \
	/elseif ( current_colour =~ "magenta") \
		/set current_colour=cyan%; \
	/elseif ( current_colour =~ "cyan") \
		/set current_colour=red%; \
	/endif

;; Explicitly colour a player, usage: "/colour <player>" 
;; To list all coloured players use "/colour"
/def colour = \
	/if ( {#} < 1 ) \
        	/quote -S /~listcolour `/list -mglob coloured_* %; \
	/else \
		/next_colour %; \
		/def -mregexp -Fp0 -P1hC%current_colour -t'^%1' coloured_%1 %; \
	/endif

/def -i ~listcolour = /echo /colour $[substr({L}, 9)]

;; Stop colouring a player, usage: "/uncolour <player>"
/def uncolour = \
	/undef coloured_%1

;; Set colour triggers for names at the beginning of the line...
/def -i -F -mregexp -Ecolour_it -t"^(([a-z]|[A-Z])+)" colour_trigger = \
	/colour %P1

;; A macro to run colour names, then "who" (and then undefine
;; set_colour_trigger so that no more people's names all coloured)...
/def cn = \
	/set colour_it=1 %; \
	who

;; Stop adding listed names.. Change state variable so we don't trigger colour_trigger.
;; Can either be called manually with "/uncn" or be triggered by an apropriate 
;; list end marker (if available).
/def -msimple -Ecolour_it -t'------ End of who marker ------' uncn = \
	/set colour_it=0

;; Colour people as they arrive (and leave, can't distinguish the moment)
/def -mregexp -t"> (([a-z]|[A-Z])+) .* <" colour_on_arrival = \
	/colour %P1

------------- Cut here --------------

Also if there is a start of who list marker available you should change
the cn macro to

/def cn = \
	/def -1 -msimple -F -t'------ Start of who marker ------' =
		/set colour_it=1 %; \
	who

This will stop lines that may come before the who list to be misinterpeted..

  This code tunred a little tricky in places, but I hope you won't have
too much problems understanding it..
  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions..

Hey,

  I must say that to have the loadable plugin/module
function would be really cool. I like it alot in ircII/Epic
and would love it even more in tf. The thing about ppl
making crap, I think most ppl will put up the whole
source to the module as well.

  That's some stuff I'd love to see actually, they
work on the statusline too? Possible to get it over
em from somewhere?

On the MUD i am on, I would like to have this:

/alias fr friend%;friend wannabe

So that when i type fr it executes both friend and freind wannabe.  This
works great, BUT when I want to add a friend I have to unalias fr type
friend (name) and pretty much /load my file again.
I tried a macro to /unalias fr, add the friend, then realias fr. I
thought that this would work:

/def fr=/alias fr friend%;friend wannabe
/def fra=/unalias fr%;friend %*%;/fr

but all /def fr=/alias fr friend%;friend wannabe does is alias fr and
outputs friend wannabe

Is there a way to have this done?

So "fr" maps to "friend" and "friend wannabe", yet a "friend" command is
left alone, unmolested.

Either I'm being dense or there's some information missing here.  Why do
you need to unalias "fr" in order to issue the command "friend foo" ?

> /def fr=/alias fr friend%;friend wannabe
> /def fra=/unalias fr%;friend %*%;/fr

Why do you need fr unaliased here?  In what way is it interfering?

Cheat :-)

/def showfriend=friend%;friend wannabe
/def addfriend=friend %*
/def friend=/if (%{1} != "") /showfriend%;/else /addfriend %*%;/endif

Or something similar (I'm not in front of a tfmachine :-)

That's it, right there.  ICQ.

How about this for an upcoming feature of TinyFugue?  Have it as simple to
use and install as ICQ for Windows users?

--Romaq, who loves TinyFugue but wouldn't imagine recommending it to a

k, i aliased fr to do 2 commands.  Friend and friend wannabe.
if i type fr (name) I get ONLY the alias fr activated.
SO what I would like to do, because i am a lazy ass and dont want to
type friend (name) out, I would like to be able to type fra (as in
friend add) to add the person. 
oh crap..i just answered my own question...just do this:
/alias fra friend %*

not only am I a lazy ass, I am a dumb ass to boot. :-(

BTW, if the mailing list charter is changed, yes, you complain too!), so I
can give attachments, I'll throw in some screenshots of my xterm window,
and send the full patch for multiple-color, and 256-color.


But, no, what I did could not be done by any reasonable plugin API, unless
you call the whole attribute subsystem a pluginable and replacable module.

The changes necessary were to:
   1. Change the comination macro (in the most recent version that uses
F_EXCLUSIVE, hawkeye seperated this out, in previous versions, I had to
find the origional combination.) Note that the combination macro is being
changed from an (attr | new) to something far more sophisticated that
masks off the foreground and background bits, specially.

Thus, this really isn't exportable as a plugin API, unless you siphon off
the entire attribute'ed string API into a plugin component.


-- 

As for the 256-color support, that runs on XTERM's only, and xterms' that
have been compiled to support 256 colors. (the 8 basic ANSI colors, the 8
bright ANSI colors, a 24-greyramp, and a 6*6*6 colorcube)

Its not designed for general RGB.

Here, more extensive changes were needed, as attributes can no longer fit
in a short.. (and in several places in the source code, Hawkeye uses
'short' instead of 'attr_t', a source of several bugs.

I also need to adjust the attribute masks. (Also, because I have had
problems recently with overflowing the smallstr buffer and getting
annoying crashes, I've extended the buffer from 65 to 129 characters. If
your tf crashes with long macro or process names, make this change!!

I also had to replace the table:

with a longer one listing all 256 colors. (not shown).

Yes, these changes could be done through a plugin API where the attributed
strings module could be changed and replaced. But, as its unlikely that
there will be a dozen different attributed string models, does it make
sense to do all the effort to split this off as something thats easily
replacable like a plugin?


I'm not saying that plugins aren't a good thing. They make sense when you
have a relatively standardized datatype, which may have unforseeable
operations done on it. (Like images and photoshop plugins, or IRC and
plugins that do automated operations by getting a copy of the IRC stream.)

But, neithr of those operations applies in this case. We had a
standardized datatype which had only forseeable operations being done to
it. I doubt any reasonable plugin API would help me at all with making my
changes, or getting my changes into tf, especially as its unlikely anyone
would do the work required to make the attribute-string API pluginable.

In the case of TF, I'd guess that plugins would make sense for attaching
to streams of text, either all incoming text, MCP streams, or main text.
Here, a plugin could register itself as handling a particular MCP stream,
or handling the 'main' stream. This could make HOOKS, TRIGGERS, and
BINDings extractable components for a plugin.

Encryption would also be a stream transducer that takes a
encrypted-raw-stream and creates a raw-stream, (which then goes into MCCP
to form a input-line-stream and MCP to form various substreams, main-in
editable-in, etc.)

Note that by plugins, I mean things distributed as source-code modules,
which may be placed into the tf build directory, where the build system
will make and link them into the final executable binary.

I just want to say that I don't think that plugins are a mystical bullet,
nor does the benefit of a particular plugin API outweight the time
and effort to design, create, and debug it. Attribute handling is just
one example where plugins do not make much sense.

There are dozens of half-finished, half-unfinished MU** servers there, and
other nuttiness. Its amusing and sad to look through the amount of of
effort and time spent on the various code there.

While ease of use doesn't forc a program to be unpowerful, the two do tend
to be correlated in general.

ICQ may be simple and easy to use, but in terms of power, does it offer
even a fraction of the power of TF? Can it support sophisticated
pattern-matching macros, multi-color syntax hilighting of messages?
Arbitrary keymaps and dynamically remapping the keyboard? How complicated
and non-easy to use would ICQ become if it became enhanced with this
power?

While such a simple MU** client may be useful to many people, maybe even
most people, it is my hope that tf does not endeavor toward this, because
*I* am a sophisticated user who needs a flexible and powerful system.

If you want a simple program, tf is that way too. Use '/addworld' to add
in worlds automatically.. What more does a simple client need?

Given this, what changes would you suggest be made to 'tf' to make it
so that you would reccomend it? [*]

A simple program should not export signifigant complexity. A complex
powerful program does have to export sufficient complexity to allow people
to utilize that power. I'd claim that for simple tasks, tf is actually
pretty effective at hiding all of its complexity
  /world XXX
  /addworld XXX
  /log LOGFILE

And if you want to use the powerful features. (Which you don't have to at
all), well, you have to expect complexity, and learning some sort of
programming/macro language.[**]

Scott

[*] Yes, it could do with having a simple GUI, including a dialog box to
add worlds, and a pull-down menu to connect to a world.

[**] Unless you can come up with the ever-promised holy grail of a
programming language thats not complicated. Many languages have been
claimed to be this (BASIC, FORTH, TCL, COBOL) None have satisfied the
claims to date.

I'm not into all that and the rest of the message.  I'm just asking that
TinyFugue be rewritten to be truely cross-platform the way Open Source
claims to be, and run native Win32 console 'as is'.  If you are not sure
what I mean, let's meet on Redwall MUCK, and you can explain to the
typical newbie on a typical night the joys of TinyFugue.  You can help
them through installing Cygwin and compiling TF (or fetching the
precompiles, your call).  You can attempt holding their attention through
the process, and convince them why it is better and easier than fetching
any Windows client that's ready to rock & roll right now.

After you have actually gone through this process a few times, _THEN_ we
can talk about TinyFugue and what needs done before I'd bother
recommending it to anyone but a Linux/UNIX user.  We are not talking about
features, not talking about ease of use or power.  We are talking about
3k+ kids (less alts) that you can convince to use TinyFugue on their MS
Windows machine right now, just as TinyFugue exists as it is today.  If
YOU can.

And if you are not really interested in that audience and those of that
group still on MUDs, MUCK's, MUSH's and MOO's five years from now, that's
ok.  But that won't be the group using TinyFugue five years from now, and
all the wiz-bang toys and plug-ins for TinyFugue will be lost to that
group.  I don't know where tomorrow's TinyFugue users will come from, I
guess they'll just be there just because.

And that's OK.  Like you, I'm quite happy with TinyFugue just the way it
is, so long as I can connect to my UNIX machine from my Windows machine to
use it.

Sure.. Given that its GPL, this is easily doable. You can make the changes
yourself, or hire out a programmer to make the appropriate changes. Or,
find and convince someone else to donate the effort. I'm not interested in
windows, but I'm sure for the right carrot, you can find someone who is.

Is this an instance of:
	``They all suck''

Cause I would not want to help a few hundred newbies do *ANYTHING*, up to
and including pressing the on-button for their computer. :)

If your users want a powerless, simplistic client, one where they just
double-click and it connects, logs in, and the rest, then TF is overkill.

But if thats what you're faced with, may I suggest spending a couple of
days on a stupid TK script, and make a zipfile with it:
   unzip and double-click on the 'connect' icon.

And watch them complain about learning that arcane, strange, gobblygook
that MUD's call a command language. :)

Then again, maybe utter simplicity is what your users want. You're pretty
quick to claim tf sucks, then state that its not deficient in power, or
simplicity, and finally not offer a single specific way it can be
improved.

If you have any useful suggestion for improving tf. please enumerate it,
why, where, and possible solutions and workaround. (And a tip: Try to make
the suggestions reasonable, in that they would be relatively simple to
implement. Suggestions like 'rewrite as a Java cross-platform Swing-based
GUI interface with internal byte-compiled programming language' are
unlikely to be followed.)


Also, state what you want in a client, the best choice may not be any
conventional client at all, whether tf, peublo, or any other. Perhaps you
want a 2 page TCL/TK script that has no macros, no hilights, and
autoconnects on startup.[1]

Please don't forget, people are not utter idiots. They've learned how to
use a word processor, they've learned how to use an email program, or ICQ.
You're even expecting them to learn the gobblygook that calls itself the
MUD command language. Many have even learned where the power button for
the computer is. Not only that, they've learned the english language, with
all its thousands of words.  Sometimes simplicity is overrated.


Scott

PS: Please have enough respect for me this time that you bother to read
and respond to the suggestions I give. People do like to have their ideas
respected when they're trying to be polite and help someone else.

[1] Politeness and respect do have their rewards. I've done this.

Well, once again I will throw my opinion at a group which will probably not
care, but :) In TF 5.0, the status line needs to be expanded. The same way we
have the isize variable to controll the number of input lines, we need also 
need an ssize variable to controll the amount of lines in the status line.
So far two seperate people have asked on this mailing list for that very thing.

Once you do that, you have better controll of the user interface, you can than
create tiny.fugue scripst for your MUD. To help people get started, and have 
a nice two or three line full ANSI status bar to help them... I mean, could you
really do this with zmud? <g>

Have you seen/tried Crescendo? A GUI for tf. It uses gnome libraries and can 
be found on the gnome website (www.gnome.org) under the software category of 
'chat'. Can't get a url for it off top of my head.

It's an ok front-end .. but needs some lovin' if anyone thinks they can help 
get in touch with the maintainer..

No, but ZMud _does_ have a painless binary install for Windows users.  The
kids flip because ZMud wants 30 bucks, which to them seems like $100 and
is about as likely to be spent.  Nah... if I could take a newbie from "Say
and :pose (I just got here by telnet, ho does this work?) to connecting
using TinyFugue in native Win32 console in two minutes plus the time it
takes to download, TF would be an instant hit with Redwall.  Kids don't
have $30 to spend on a MU* client any more than they have $100.  Pueblo,
dead as it is, has a loyal following.  It's still a free client.  The
rest of the clients are somewhere between free and useless or powerful and
extreemly expensive, to a kid.

So you are looking at a gap that TinyFugue could fill _EXTREMLY_ well
among the patrons of Redwall MUCK except for a few minor details.  
Like... 1) there's no way in hell you are going to get them to download
and install Cygnus, nevermind 2) compile TinyFugue under the Cygnus
extensions.  I know most the people on this list were compiling their own
Linux kernal while wearing diapers, and this should be as plain and
obvious as using the rising sun to know what time to go to bed.  The
typical kid isn't there, doesn't know, doesn't care.  And if you don't get
them using TinyFugue within two minutes of downloading, forget it.

That's what ICQ is doing that TinyFugue doesn't.

You're right.  That's how open source works, or doesn't, as the case may
be.  While it would be nice to simply have the software written by design
to compile equally well under GNU's compiler as Microsoft Visual C++, it
isn't there, and it's highly unlikely it will ever be made to work that
way.

<laughs> All that I ask before you play the MUCK is a crash course in
installing a pseudo OS on top of what you already use, and compiling your
own code.  After all, if you can't compile your own programs, YOU SUCK!

Well, I have an unending stream of people who are connecting to the server
for their first time.  They are just learning say and pose, and they are
finding telnet quite does not quite do the job for them.  You have stated
for me quite clearly why TinyFugue is not and will never be the client to
recommend to them as a Windows User.  You have no respect or concerns for
their needs, and your only suggestion to them is to learn how to install
Cygnus and compile their source code, 'cause that's just how it has to be
done... all before they can even play on Redwall or see what Redwall is
all about.  Or they can just use something else.  Which they will, and
which I will continue to suggest they do.  You suggest I write a script
using a GNU tool.  How do you propose they run it?  Hm?  Last I checked,
neither Win98 nor Win2k came with TCL or TLK installed.  Must have been a
bad shipment.

Thanks, but no thanks.

I know.  That's why it really gripes me to see to see far more interest in
making TF 'cool' with tools most MU* players will never be aware of or
care for, while the basics of getting casual users able to USE TinyFugue
isn't all that important.  I'd like to see the idea of 'newbie users' able
to use TinyFugue without a crash course in UNIX and compiling.  I'd like
to see my idea respected and taken seriously.  But I recognize that simply
isn't going to happen.  So... go back to your toys and arcane, dark arts
that you really don't want available to the general public.  That kid
connecting to a MU* for the first time who wants to jump in right now
really isn't your target audience anyway.

> [1] Politeness and respect do have their rewards. I've done this.

I'll keep that in mind next time I explain, yet again, that I don't use
Windows to connect to the MUCK, and what I'm using won't be helpful for
them.  And I'll continue directing them to software that will get the kids
going as quickly as possible.

Oh come now.  That only took me 56 lines to code up in TCL/Tk, including
blank lines between functions.  Nowhere near two pages.  :-)

Sorry for that silly injection.  I happened to have just written that
exact test script, to test the viability of adding SSL support to my
TCL/Tk mud client.  Actually, my mud client started out as a proof of
concept test script itself, three or so years ago.  Now I'm writing
other proof of concept test scripts for it.  I've come full circle, I
guess.  :-)

PS: Regarding ease of use vs. power...  Well, IMHO, I no longer believe
such a dichotomy intrinsicly exists, after having seen (and coded on)
programs that are both.  You just have to spend more time on design and
coding.  Companies are limited on time-to-market, so they sacrifice
either power or ease of use to reduce time.  Open Source projects don't
have to.

Not to interject into such an eloquent argument on the virtues of Unix,
and Unix derived software with it's carefully crafted architecture of
library dependancies and architectual differences in it's dozens of
forms, but a Windows binary installation exists, and has for a couple of
years now.

It's not an 'official' release, but in general it works, and I've tried
to even keep it up to date with the Cygnus and TinyFugue source trees.
I've even offered CD installations of it, with no interest.

At present it exists in 2 places, http://www.druware.com/tf (an older
installation) and http://www.wilburware.net (a newer install, but
largely untested on Win9x machines).  I might also mention that I'm
working on binary installers for MacOS X, I have one for BeOS (if they
ever release BONE) and I've tinkered with one for Red Hat Linux (6.2 and
now 7.1) but I've concluded that 90% of the Linux community would rather
build it themselves, so there is no need for a binary installer.  I did
however get a request for an OS/2 installer, so I am planning on
reloading an OS/2 machine here at the office so I can build a current
OS/2 binary.  

Now, does any of this require an ounce of effort on Ken's part?  No.  TF
5.0 requires 0 changes to make this happen.


*IF* Ken wanted to change 1 thing to make it easier, I'd ask that he
remove the Select() against file descriptors assumption and move to a
more platform independent solution. That is the sole item preventing a
native Windows and BeOS non-BONE implementation.  I've hacked around it
in both cases, but it introduces some instabilities that I've been
unwilling to release.  (You know little things like random lockups of
the console while processing the 900b login/splash screens of your
average LPMUD! :-).

Beyond that, if you want to write for an add-on architecture, I've
already done some of the groundwork for windows, implementing a
'/loadlibrary()' function for my own usage. Then using good old TF
script, and a Delphi Windows DLL, I implement all sorts of callouts to
system utils that I simply don't have in TF. This could easily be
expanded to include other features, and when used in conjunction with
the existing HOOK mechanism, can accomplish almost everything Zmud does
(without the 32 meg running memory footprint, or the lovely little ANSI
parsing immediate crash and exit bugs).  I've never bothered publishing
or polishing anything beyond the base because the vast majority of the
TF users don'at seem to want anything to do with the Windows version.
Me, I like TF, I like Windows despite it's quirks.  I'm comfortable in
UNIX(AIX, Solaris, RH Linux, Debian Linux, Digital Unix), OS/2, BeOS,
MacOS, MacOS X, and Windows, and while I use each of the mentioned Oses
during the course of most weeks, my laptop runs Linux and Windows 2000,
and spends 90% of the time in Windows 2000.  

In otherwords gentlemen, I have no idea why you are arguing.  It is my
feeling that what you want already exists (even though it's still not
ICQ easy once you get it installed to create a world and begin playing!)

Hi!

I know that there is not a way on TinyFugue to scroll back the output from
the mud without any script, but some time ago I found a link on its site
where I found history.tf, that should do this...

The problem is that history.tf doesn't work ;-))

Yes, it "runs", but it's bugged, I think that it's for an older version of
TinyFugue and so it doesn't work perfectly under v. 4.0s1.

Can someone tell me something about this?

I enabled more scrolling and I think it's a great thing, but sometimes
it'd be useful...

Since when?

Open Source is "you get the source code, you can modify it, and do what
you like with the results, as long as you pass on these rights" or some
modification thereof.

I've not yet seen any definition of Open Source which includes
"cross-platform".  A degree of Unix platform compatibility was listed as
an aim for the early days of the GNU project, to get the tools adopted
and improved, until such time as there would be a GPL'd Operating
System.  This has lingered on, as something which _many_ authors aim
for, rather than coercing people into using one particular OS.  It is
not something which Open Source claims to be.

If it happens that with some extra libraries, POSIX code can be made to
run on Windows, congratulations.  If someone's willing, as Andy Sartori
(? I think) is, to package up a working version of this,
congratulations.  But demanding that authors rewrite their code to
better fit the use of the OS which you use is both highly arrogant and
unrealistic.  Why should Ken Keys spend money on Windows and development
tools for Windows in order to make TinyFugue run better on Windows, if
he's only ever going to use it on some Unix variant?

If you want better Windows compatibility, write it yourself and offer
the patches back to Ken.  Don't demand that other people go out of their
way, spending their money, to hand you everything which you ask for.

Hello here :)

I decided to join the discussion of the upcoming features. How about
improving existing features? Like... logging.

Correct me if I am wrong, but I haven't found a way in TF to produce log
that would be a 100% copy of what I have in my terminal. No, I am not
talking about colors. I am playing a diku based mud
(carrionfields.com:9999) that sends unterminated prompt (I think it's
called LP in TF terminology). I tried to play with options for /log command
and the best solution I came up with is this:

/set LC_TIME=C
/eval /set logfile=~/private/mud/CF/logs/automatic/\
  $[world_info()].$[ftime("%d-%B-%Y-%H:%M:%S", time())]
/eval /log -w %logfile
/eval /log -i %logfile
/eval /log -l %logfile

It logs _almost_ everything that I see in my terminal. Only things that I
don't see in the logs is the prompt of the mud on the lines that had
commands, e.g.

<100%hp 100%m 100%mv> look

is converted into

look

I've written a message into this mail list about it, and got no answer so
far. Still looking for a better solution. Using TF TinyFugue version 4.0
stable 1 on sparc solaris 8 and mandrake linux 7.2.

Heh... :)

I didn't want to count up the exact number of lines in my stuff, and also,
I was assuming that one would make a *slightly* more sophisticated dialog.
where the top-part is read-only, selectable, and all text goes to the edit
window, regardless of where the focus is. (Much like tf under xterm)

Figuring out how to redirect events like that is another page or two worth
of code I didn't want to count up. :)

I dunno.... I know of no programming language to date that I'd suggest my
mother or sister use. So, any MUD client that includes a programming
language must, by default, have a part of itself that would be hard for
either to use.

I think that thats a wall that anyone will come up against.

A program can hide its complex parts very well, so for simplistic uses, it
appears utterly easy to use, and for sophisticated uses, it has underlying
power to do stuff. I'd say with /addworld and /world, that tf has probably
got that part covered. :)

I build my own, it resolves any question of dependencies rather nicely.  
If there was an 'official' RPM, I may perhaps use it, but I think TF was
the first compiles I've ever done, and it's what I get MUCKers started on
first when they finish installing their first Linux box and want to know
what to do next.  On the whole, compiling everything appears the UNIX way
to go, and binaries with GUI installer appears the Windows way to go, and
that's how we offer NMC.  The expectation goes with the platform as a
generality, and if HedRat doesn't pull their Hed out of their Rat, I'm
going to make my own private distribution compiling from scratch from boot
sector go.  RedHat smells strongly of Microsoft quality control practicies
on their distro release.  But I digress.

The software company I worked for makes heavy use of VMWare, and it's a
pity OS/2 can't run under it.  But otherwise, if you don't have or have
not heard of VMWare, you might want to take a look.  Oh drat, I just
trashed my test environment and my computer won't reboot.  I guess I'll
have to delete that Virtual Machine and copy a virgin test environment
over.  We use VMWare to spank NMC across any development environment we
find useful without having to tie up machines and 'virgin install' times.

We did similar for converting FBMuck 5.x to run native Win32 console.  
It's good to work in a professional software development firm and have
those tools available for hobby type things. :)  I recall the
Select() issue coming up before, a very long time ago, and I believe it
was decided platform independence would require a major rework of
TinyFugue.  Was that not correct?

And that, to answer your 'why argue?' question, is why I poked the list.  
I don't expect to change minds or opinions.  But I find it useful and
entertaining while I consider issues with NMC and future client interfaces
to the server.

I _very_ much like Windows2000, and I'm debating between $300 for a VMWare
license plus more memory or building another box.  I want Linux for
running Pine and TinyFugue, as well as for NMC development.  The
particular quirks of NMC development require that we send 'scripts' over
the network from a script quoting client (tf's /quote on steriods) to the
MUCK.  We have a hook that lets us remove the choke, limiting how fast we
can ram the scripts into the server just for this purpose.

Even sending the data 'localhost' from the client to the server, this
process is an order of magnatude in difference between the Linux machine
and the Win2k machine.  It's the difference between doing NMC builds in 30
minutes on Linux or 3 minutes on Win2k.  So, for right now, we are using
Win2k as our development environment for NMC.  _NOT_ Linux or BSD from
which it was derived.  We are VERY glad we 'went native' with Win32
console development of the MUCK server.

It is a curious question, but what exactly would the work BE to have TF
run native Win32 console?  I must confess, I'm an admin, I'm not a
programmer.  I had NOTHING to do with having NMC run in Win32 console, I'm
attached to the project in other areas.  The guy who did the work is
currently teaching it for a living, and he has no interest in TF
development though he's a TF user.  But...

...peculiar to TinyFugue, what changes in the code would it take, and
would Ken permit those changes into the 'official' release if they had no
negative impact upon the software?  I think those two questions would have
to be detailed, and the second question is more important than anything
else.

I'll give it a shot this week with a few vict... uhm, volunteers.  For all
that, my point of contention about 'upcoming features' is that if Windows
users remain 'unworthy' within the TinyFugue community, then whatever
extentions are made to TF for on the fly compression, SSH and such will
STILL have to find servers willing to put that in on their side... servers
mostly serving Windows users.  Windows users may not be 'worthy', they are
STILL the major market share, and I can't think of a single newbie user to
the MUCK who's claimed to be running Linux or UNIX.

Hi, in relation to the useful logging scripts I saw yesterday or the
day before, anyone know how to automatically generate a filename based
on the system's date&time? or some unique identifier generated from
it?

Thanks

I extreemly very much like TF's way of letting me pick my own language
through the shell, and otherwise letting me do what I want.  Someone else
worked out a 'sing' program for me that works on TF using Perl.  I think
the best programming language for a client is this open-endedness of
letting users have what's available on their system.  It's one of the
reasons I don't consider a Windows GUI for personal use.

This is a quicky set of def's I threw together to help me with my logging.
It's not real robust, and isn't bullet proof, but it does the job for me.

Obviously mozilla wraps the text a little, but you get the idea...
Also, I am aware that under certain circumstances this macro could end 
up triggering itself repeatedly and I'll fix that myself...

This is my first non-ripped-off set of macros longer than 1 short line, 
and just want some style pointers I guess...

The everything is colored, and the *'s are #'s which will be different
nearly everytime

2) When I complete a quest I will say:
You tell your friends: '*qp+2, *g, * train, * trivia point, * practices'
yet again everything is colored and the *'s are #'s.  But here, the
trivia, train and practices and NOT always there...so i might NOT get
any of them, or i might get a combination
(trivia....train....practice...trivia, train...trivia, practice...train
practice).  the qp's and g's are always there, tho the #'s will be
diff.  So the best option there is to have the trigger work on the: You
tell your friends: '*qp+2, *g

What I would like to do is take JUST those lines, and make 2 different
logs.  One named levels.log and another called questpoints.log.  (heck,
if they can be in excel <levels.xls, questpoints.xls> that would be even
better)
I dont need:
You tell your friends: '<-:->LEVEL<-:-> - Stats raised by: ......'
or
You tell your friends: '......'
logged, just the internal stuff:
*hps/*mana/*moves/*pracs
and
*qp+2, *g, * train, * trivia point, * practices
             ^if applicable
logged in a running fashion:
20hps/23mana/24moves/8pracs
21hps/24mana/24moves/7pracs
19hps/21mana/19moves/9pracs
22hps/20mana/20moves/7pracs

Same type of thing for the quests.
I don't have any experience logging, and I read the help file, but still
can't figure out how to do that....any help?

Thanks,
Jason

I want to set up a bunch of aliases to homogenize a set of commands across
different mushes.

I know I can set them up like so:

/alias +bbread \
	/if (%{fg_world} =~ "Firan") %; \
		@bb/read %{*} %; \
	/else %; \
		+bbread %{*} %; \
	/endif

/alias +bbscan \
	/if (%{fg_world} =~ "Firan") %; \
		@bb/scan %{*} %; \
	/else %; \
		+bbscan %{*} %; \
	/endif

(etc...)


Rather than have a dozen or so of these aliases (alii? aliasum?) it would be
nice if I could do something like:

/alias +bb* \
	/if (%{fg_world} =~ "Firan") %; \
		@bb/%{1} %; \
	/else %; \
		+bb%{1} %; \
	/endif

Obviously I'd need to split any args out of the globbed '*' in the alias
definition, but you get the idea.  If I could do something like this, I could
cut it down to a single alias instead of a whole mess of them.

Possible?

Not tested, but something like:
/set M_A=@
/set M_B=/
/alias +bbread %{M_A}bb%{M_B}read %{*}

If you use multiple worlds, then perhaps define a hook on WORLD to
change %M_A and %M_B according to the type of the world which you're
foregrounding.  Use subtypes to help with the pattern-matching, eg:
/addworld -T'lpp.foo' Firan whatever
/addworld -T'lpp.bar' Otherone whatever
[etc]

/def -T'lpp.foo' -h'WORLD ' set_bb_vars_foo = /set M_A=@%;/set M_B=/
/def -T'lpp.bar' -h'WORLD ' set_bb_vars_bar = /set M_A=+%;/set M_B=

Does that work/help?

   Remember that aliases are send hooks..

/def -i -ag -p2 -mregexp -wFiran -h"SEND \+bb(.*)" alias_+bb1 = \
	@bb/%P1 %*

/def -i -ag -p1 -mregexp -h"SEND \+bb(.*)" alias_+bb2 = \
	+bb%P1 %*


   Not at all sure that these work, but my point is that you can
define send hooks for each world..

Hey!
I'm playing LP muds, and I've got such things like healtch and
fatigue displayed on /visual bar.
I want them to change their colors when they change their value
(for example, green when i'm in a good health and red when i'm barely
alive)
do you know how to do it?

and second thing...
I'd like to download arrays script for tf, could you send me some link?
(or script itself if ya got it)

  Have done it myself, here's my scripts..

---------------
;  Coloring code made by jaw@cd.chalmers.se
;

/set my_hp=?
/set my_hp_max=?
/set my_gp=?
/set my_gp_max=?
/set my_xp=?

; White until we know what it should be..
/set my_hp_color=white
/set my_gp_color=white


; Trigger of the displaying of the values and remember to call /do_status_colors after you
; have saved the values to the variables..
/def -F -i -mregexp -t"^Hp: ([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)  Gp: ([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)  Xp: ([0-9]+)" loc_trig_sb = \
        /set my_hp=%P1 %; \
        /set my_hp_max=%P2 %; \
        /set my_gp=%P3 %; \
        /set my_gp_max=%P4 %; \
        /set my_xp=%P5 %; \
        /do_status_colors

/def -F -i -mregexp -t"^Hp: ([0-9]+) \(([0-9]+)\) Gp: ([0-9]+) \(([0-9]+)\)" loc_trig_hpinfight = \
        /set my_hp=%P1 %; \
        /set my_hp_max=%P2 %; \
        /set my_gp=%P3 %; \
        /set my_gp_max=%P4 %; \
        /do_status_colors

/def -F -i -mregexp -t"^You have ([0-9]+) \(([0-9]+)\) guild points\." loc_trig_gp = \
      /set my_gp=%P1 %; \
      /set my_gp_max=%P2 %; \
      /do_status_colors

; Calculate the colors..
/def -i do_status_colors = \
        /if ( my_hp > (my_hp_max / 2) ) \
                /set my_hp_color=green %; \
        /elseif ( my_hp < (my_hp_max / 4) ) \
                /set my_hp_color=red %; \
        /else %; \
                /set my_hp_color=yellow %; \
        /endif %; \
        /if ( my_gp > (my_gp_max / 2) ) \
                /set my_gp_color=green %; \
        /elseif ( my_gp < (my_gp_max / 4) ) \
                /set my_gp_color=red %; \
        /else %; \
                /set my_gp_color=yellow %; \
        /endif %; \
        /set_status_bar

; This is how we set the bar..
/def -i set_status_bar = \
        /set status_fields="MyName" :2 "Hp:" my_hp:4:C%{my_hp_color} "(" my_hp_max:4 \
        ")" :2 "Gp:" my_gp:3:C%{my_gp_color} "(" my_gp_max:3 ")" :2 "Xp:" my_xp:6 \
        @log:5 :1 insert :1 @clock:5

; Set it the first time also..
/set_status_bar

--------------------

   It's a little raw since it's made for my own use and wasn't really thought of
to distribute.. Anyway it looks at and changes the color of my hps and gps (mana)
and colors them accordingly..
   The code should be fairly straight forward..

   Don't quite know what you mean with array scripts..

   As always, feel free to ask questions..

There are 2 things that I would like to be able to log.

1) When i gain a lvl i will say on a channel:
You tell your friends: '<-:->LEVEL<-:-> - Stats raised by:
*hps/*mana/*moves/*pracs'
The everything is colored, and the *'s are #'s which will be different
nearly everytime

2) When I complete a quest I will say:
You tell your friends: '*qp+2, *g, * train, * trivia point, * practices'
Yet again everything is colored and the *'s are #'s.  But here, the
trivia, train and practices and NOT always there...so i might NOT get
any of them, or i might get a combination
(trivia....train....practice...trivia, train...trivia, practice...train
practice).  the qp's and g's are always there, tho the #'s will be
diff.  So the best option (as far as *I* can think of) there is to have
the trigger work on the:
You tell your friends: '*qp+2, *g

What I would like to do is take JUST those lines, and make 2 different
logs.  One named levels.log and another called questpoints.log.  (heck,
if they can be in excel <levels.xls, questpoints.xls> that would be even
better)
I dont need:
You tell your friends: '<-:->LEVEL<-:-> - Stats raised by: ......'
or
You tell your friends: '......'
logged, just the internal stuff:
*hps/*mana/*moves/*pracs
and
*qp+2, *g, * train, * trivia point, * practices
             ^if applicable
logged in a running fashion:
20hps/23mana/24moves/8pracs
21hps/24mana/24moves/7pracs
19hps/21mana/19moves/9pracs
22hps/20mana/20moves/7pracs

Same type of thing for the quests.
I don't have any experience logging, and I read the help file as well as
the tfio help file, but still
can't figure out how to do it.
I think it has something to do with:
tfopen(levels.log,a)  &
tfopen(questpoints.log,a)

but that is as much as I can figure :-(

Thanks,
Jason

I still don't see -how-.  I'm not great with TF code.  Could I just
do:

~login_hook_telnet = /def -n1 -ip2147483647 \
   -mglob -w -h'PROMPT (mycroft )?login:*'

?  No, that doesn't work.

Why doesn't that work?

Because you're using glob as the matching type, but '(mycroft )?' is a
regular expression.  As a glob, '(mycroft )?' will match the exact string
'(mycroft )' followed by any one character.

You could try to fix this a few ways... I'm not entirely sure these will
all work, or which is the recommended (IMO 3 is best, but that may depend
on your situation):

- change to -mregexp, and use something like 'PROMPT ^(mycroft )?login:' as
  the hook text.
- just use 'PROMPT *login:*' as the hook text with -mglob.
- define a new login hook for just this world, using -T to match, that
  explicitly uses 'PROMPT mycroft login:*'

Hi all.

I have 2 questions I hope to get some help with...

1. Speed issues
I use regexp alot and wonder if that slow down more than glob patterns.
Is there a way to ensure the client is as fast as possible? Is it that 
inefficient to use (.*) in regexp and what can I use instead?


2.
I play on MUME where the prompt can look like following

	* >		(Day)
	o >		(night)

When the mud send me something I can get the following line

	*an Elf* is standing here.

But sometimes people tell me what thay see and I see this

	Someone tells you '*an Elf* is standng here' or
	* >Someone tells you '*an Elf* is standng here'

And other times the text is shown just after the prompt instead of 
on a line of its own like this:

	* >*an Elf* is standing here or
	o >*an Elf* is standing here 


I can trigger "*an Elf* is standing here" on a line of its own, gag it and
/echo the line colored so I can see it better. I like to be able to trigger 
all lines and color it and still be able to gag line and type it out but the
"* >" in standard color and the rest of the line, in this case, green. I used
(.*) but that is inefficient according to the helpfiles.

So.. How do I trigger all of the following lines

	*an Elf* is standing here.
	* >*an Elf* is standing here.
	o >*an Elf* is standing here 
	Some tells you '*an Elf* is standing here*

gag the line and /echo it colored with only "*an Elf* is standing here." in 
colors.

// Thanks. ke

ehm, well, otherwise fine but doesn't really make it
simpler... the point was that i wanted to make it so
that i'd have to have %stuph on the if only once while
comparing it to several integers... but i guess it's
impossible? .)

hey =E5ke,

  try /help substitue, I think you could try something like this;

/def -mglob -t'*\*an Elf\* is standing here.' elf =3D \
  /subsitute -aBCgreen *an Elf* is standing here.

  dunno if I understood ye right, but that will make all the
patterns above to return '*an Elf* is standing here.' in bold
green.

Thanks for your help. I am sorry if I didnt make my question clear.. The substitute removes any text
before or after the matching text.

I have a finished line like this:

/def -mregexp -ag -t'^(.*)\*(.*)\*(.*)is here(.*)' enemy_ishere =\
	/echo -p -aCgreen @{Cwhite}%{P1}@{Cyellow}*@{Cred}%P2@{Cyellow}*@{n}%{P3}is here%{P4}. 

This def will trigger any line containing for example "*an Elf* is here, riding a horse" and its output
is yellow stars, red name, and normal text for the "is here". I use (.*) in the beginning to catch lines
from for example players who emote and perhaps like to fool me and the text(if any) before the one 
I like to redo is written in white. I have read in the helpfiles (.*) is inefficient but can't figure out how 
to use regexp or glob patterns to trigger it. Because of me gagging and rewriting the line I do need 
to be able to have that text in a variable to.

Can I use a glob pattern and make it faster? 

---------
And... Another question about keys.

I'd like to be able to use keyup and keydown(arrows) like this.

When I press keyup I like to see the last line I saw on the input line and therefore only have to press 
enter to issue the command to the mud again. Now, when I press keyup tf find the last command sent
to the mud or something and every now and then this happens. (I use /telnet to my server to test)

[connected]

I type ls in tf and press enter	(And get a file listing from the host)
I type ls -la and press enter	(and get a long file listing from the host)

THEN...

When I press arrow up to get the "ls -al" back I get only the
"ls" and cant find "ls -al" at all in history???

This can be annoying in a mud, fighting, when I cast a spell and press up arrow
and it finds another command instead of the cast spell again so I can issue the command fast... 

I dont know if its something about my settings or if any of the bind_bash.tf or anything does something
I just can't figre out why it does that.

// Thanks. ke

hey ke,

  try /help substitue, I think you could try something like this;

/def -mglob -t'*\*an Elf\* is standing here.' elf = \
  /subsitute -aBCgreen *an Elf* is standing here.

  dunno if I understood ye right, but that will make all the
patterns above to return '*an Elf* is standing here.' in bold
green.

A faster version would be:

/def -mregexp -ag -t'\*([^*]*)\*(.*)is here' enemy_ishere =\
    /echo -p -aCgreen @{Cwhite}%{PL}@{Cyellow}*@{Cred}%P1@{Cyellow}*@{n}%{P2}is here%{PR}. 

Using [^*]* instead of .* between the two fixed \*s it'll be faster.  This
of course only works if your lines won't have a * in them.

By excluding the front anchor (ie ^.*) in this case and using
%PL to extract that information, you will probably speed up for lines
which don't match this pattern, and probably all lines.  With the leading
^.*, it will suck in the entire line and then have to backtrack a bunch to
find the right pattern, since regexp *s are greedy operations.  By just
starting with \*, it'll scan forward much faster to the portion of the
line you care about.

Glob matching only does matching, not extraction, so you would have to
be able to use the %1...%N word extraction, which I think is going to
not work very well for what you want.

I wouldn't worry.. I've got about a hundred or so (fallthrough) regexp
triggers that I constantly have enabled. They're all fallthrough too. so
it tries to match each one of them on each and every line.

I have a macro that makes triggers, and I use it to make triggers for
about 60 friends. Then I have another 20 or so for hilighting whispers,
pages, and stuff in () "" <> '' [].  So about a hundred overall, all
regexp.

Actually, I've thought of making a macro that makes macros that makes
macros for hilighting the names of friends. I've got different sets of
friends that should be in different colors. :) Why write each of those
macros when I can write a macro that makes 'em. :)

It takes a tenth of a second to read and hilight 8 kilobytes, which means
about 80kb/sec (about 40 screenfulls/second). Even if you have a thousand
friends and other hilight macros, thats still four screenfuls/second.

So, I wouldn't worry about speed.


Note that my macros are basically all autogenerated. Thus, I don't build
macros for a MU** until or unless I log in. If you have 100 macros each
for 10 worlds of your worlds in one file, you may pay the cost of 1000
macros not 100. As I've never run tf that way, I wouldn't know.

So I have things like:
/eval /def -w${world_name} -p1009 -P1Crgb_522 -t'[.( ,](\\"[^\\"]*\\")' -F
INquotes1_${world_name}
/eval /def -w${world_name} -p1009 -P1Crgb_522 -t'[.( ,](\\"[^\\"]*)' -F
INquotes2_${world_name}
/eval /def -w${world_name} -p1009 -P1Crgb_522 -t'(\"[^\"]*\")\$' -F
INquotes3_${world_name}
;

Where the eval fills in the world_name for only that world.

First, you want hilights, like above where I have P1Crgb_522 which means
to hilight the text that matches the first set of parenthesis in the
chosen color.

If you have several ways in which the text may be represented, use several
macros for each one. You can also play games with non-fallthrough macros
and priority. (Make the '* >' macro a higher priority and not fallthrough,
so if it matches, tf doesn't look for more macros.


Note that this is stuff is made a lot nicer with my 256 color patch for tf
and with the multi-color patch which makes tf behave nicely when you try
to assign more than one color to some text.

Set up hilights to match each case and color the parts of the line you
want. And, don't gag&echo the line, use hilights '/help hilight' or
definitions '/help def'

For example:

% 302: /def -Fp700 -P0Crgb_235 -t'XXX'
  XXX_them
% 303: /def -Fp1530 -aCbggray4 -mregexp -t'XXX'
  XXX_line

The second macro hilights any line with XXX in it, the entire line, who
may have its color set to anything. The first macro onli hilights the
specific word XXX

Note that your tf does not support these colors, so you'll have to set
them differently.

My advice is to experiment with the above lines, changing the priorities
and fall-thru (-F) flag.

Oh yeah.  I use regexp for everything so often I forget!

Is there a way to preserve ansi escape sequences sent by the game through
triggers?

I have several triggers that look for certain text, intercept it, modify it,
then send it to me.  The only problem is that any color codes sent by the game
are not preserved.

e.g.:
/def -Fp10 -ag -w'MyMUSH' -mregexp \
     -t'\\(=\\)----<\\+>----%-\\((.*)\\)-%----<\\+>----\\(=\\)' \
     -q mymushfinger2 =
        /echo -w %PL\----------------(%P1)----------------%PR

doable?

First, I'd like to ask if there's a list archive I can search through for previously 
mentioned questions I may have and don't want to repeat.

Beforehand: I'm using client 4.0s1 on linux kernel 2.4.3 (Slackware 7.1)..

Now the next 2 things:
1. I play on a diku mud and it has a prompt:
Do you wish to create a new character? Y/N

I can get all other login prompts to work, but that one just does not seem to 
want to hook. I tried:
/def -h"PROMPT Do you wish to create a new character? Y/N " log_new = N

I tried backslashing the ? and /, and tried all 3 types of matching. Is this 
something with the mud or the client, or something I'm doing wrong?

2. Numpad keys. I know people probably bring this up all the time. I want to 
bind 2, 4, 6, 8 in the numpad section ONLY to north, south, east, west. I also 
want 5 as look, 0 as save, 9 & 3 as up and down. Can these be done?
I can set quite a few term types, do I need to set a certain one? And also 
what are the actual key characters I use for binding?

Thanks, Jesse

(1) Are you absolutely sure that there's a space at the end?
(2) Try "-msimple" to not have any special character interpretation

/help bind

See the example which binds <control-X>tw

Make sure Num_Lock is _off_.

Type "/sh /bin/sh" to get a raw shell, almost certainly with the
relevant environmental details set to the same as tinyfugue sees.  Then,
for each key, press <control-V> followed by that key.

<control-V> means "literal next character".  The next character will be
an ESC, shown as "^[", and shown literally, together with the rest of
the string generated by pressing that key.

When finished, "exit" to return to tf.

A while ago I got help with a trigger, that works great, but now I need
another trigger that is quite like it.
The original trigger was this:

/def -mregexp -t'^Questor tells you \'As a reward, I am giving you
([0-9]+) quest points and ([0-9]+) gold' reward1 = \
  /set rewardstr=%{P1}qp, %{P2}g %; \
  /repeat -2 1 /ftreward
/def -mregexp -t'^\*\* You gain (.+) \*\*' reward2 = \
  /set rewardstr=%{rewardstr}, %{P1}
/def ftreward = \
  ft %{rewardstr}

I would go on a quest and when completed I would get for example:
Questor tells you 'As a reward, I am giving you 23 quest points and 100
gold'
** You gain 1 train **
And I would announce it via a command:
ft 20qp, 1280g, 1 train

Now there is a change on the MUD i reside on, they are changing the way
levels are gained.
It USED to be:
You gain 8 hit points, 9 mana, 6 moves, 2 practices.

NOW this is the way that it will look for example:
You gain 8 hit points, 9 mana, 6 moves, 2 practices and 3 trains.
Lucky! You gain an extra 1 training session!
You gain a bonus Strength point!
You gain a bonus Dexterity point!

(note: the Lucky and points are all random, I'll get them at times, and
i dont know how many i may get..i might get just one point or maybe
4...etc..)

I have a trigger that works for the OLD one:
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'You gain (.*) hit points, (.*) mana, (.*) moves,
and (.*) practices.' level= \
ft @RLEVEL@w - Stats raised by: @W%P1hps/%P2mana/%P3moves/%P4pracs@w

I tried reworking the Quest macro to fit into the new lvling scheme and
came up with:
/def -mregexp -t'^You gain ([0-9]+) hit points, ([0-9]+) mana, ([0-9]+)
moves, ([0-9]+) practices and ([0-9]+) trains.' level1 =\
   /set levelstr=LEVEL - Stats raised by:
%{P1}hps/%{P2}mana/%{P3}moves/%{P4}pracs/%{P5}trains %;\
   /repeat -2 1 /ftlevel
/def -mregexp -t'^You gain a bonus (.+)!' level2 =\
   /set levelstr=%{levelstr}, %{P1}
/def -mregexp -t'^Lucky! You gain an extra (.+)!' level3 =\
   /set levelstr=%{levelstr}, %{P1}
/def ftlevel =\
   ft %{levelstr}

so that it says
ft LEVEL - Stats raised by: 10hps/9mana/8moves/3pracs/2trains, Strength
point, Dexterity point

But I dont want the word "point" there. And if I put the word "point"
in:
/def -mregexp -t'^You gain a bonus (.+)!' level2 =\
it wont work at all.

For some reason the Lucky part will not work nor be picked up.

Can someone help?

Thanks,
Jason

Hi,

I'm using TF for our lp-mud "uni.mud.de". Within this mud, an editor exists
that uses several control sequences of the terminal. If I work with a "pure"
telnet, all works fine. But with TF, almost any keypress (especially the 
cursor keys and the CTRL key bindings) is ignored and the display of the
editor doesn't work correctly. 

I have tried to add
  /more off
  /set visual off
  /set emulation raw
while I'm using this internal editor, but this is not enough. How can I
switch to a "real" telnet mode within TF? With all its key bindings and
control sequences?

Regards,
Oliver

There are two basic types of telnet connection.  Character-mode and
line-mode.  Character-mode involves sending a packet for each keypress
(or every few keypresses if typing fast enough, thanks to some TCP
optimisation tricks).  Line-mode sends a packet for each line, and you
can perform local editting on the line before sending it, with some
clients.

Tinyfugue supports line-mode telnet.  You need character-mode telnet.
You're not going to get this with TinyFugue.  It's conceivable that you
could set something up with tfio streams and /sys and a telnet client
which talks to an established connection, but even then you'd face
problems if the connection weren't reset correctly.

You have a "real" telnet line-mode.  Just not a character-mode.  To be
honest, I've never before heard of a MUD supporting character-mode
telnet and it seems particularly antisocial, in terms of bandwidth
consumption on a popular mud with so many packets flying around for the
keypresses.

Does the MUD support one of the protocols for sending files to be
editted locally?  If so, you may wish to investigate setting that up.
Then you can use your favourite text-editor, with low latency, not
sending a few thousand packets across the wire.

I like to run micq in a tf world.

At current, I telnet to localhost to do it. I'd prefer not to have the
extra step.

Is there a way to execute a command in a world, as opposed to shelling
out of tf?

That would demand that the MUD implements the ICQ service. I would
guess that that is rarely done.

I guess that's not what he meant. Sure you can execute a program within
TF, but I have no idea how nice an ICQ client would be in a tf world, and
I guess you need to have some type of FIFO file and build a script or
something. 

The command is somewhat like this:
  /quote -S -decho '<program>

Try /help quote

Tho, don't think /quote was featured for those kind of stuff ;)

I think that he means "without connecting to a MUD".

Ie, have TinyFugue be able to run an arbitrary line-based interactive
command, and treat that as a world, so that you can switch between them
and be notified of activity.

I had a look and couldn't figure out a way to do it.  Tinyfugue is great
for tfio streams, /sys is available, etc etc, but I couldn't find a way
to make a new World as a wrapper.  So I just looked at this again, this
time going to the source.

tinyfugue is pretty much built around the idea of opening TCP sockets.
Someone had a SSH patch -- the original poster might want to start from
there.

I've been trying to convert a few TUsh users to tinyfugue and one of the
things they've mentioned is having a fixed prompt - not a magic one sent by the
talker.

The best I've come up with is /trig * = /prompt blah blah but now that I'm
using this too one of my /gags has stopped gagging.

This is my /listdef:
% 256: /def -p0 -mglob -t'*dled out*' = .-
% 259: /def -p0 -mglob -t'* :*jug*' = /beep
% 260: /def -p0 -mglob -t'* >*' = /beep
% 262: /def -p0 -ag -mglob -t'*+++ ---------*'
% 330: /def -p0 -mglob -t'*' = /prompt Juggler     :

Is the ordering important for triggers and would that mean that having the
gag line (262) after the prompt line (330) mean that it would appear to
work?

Also, is there a better way of doing fixed prompts?  Like a /prompt command
which doesn't forget the prompt after receiving more lines from the talker?

I tried playing with the prompt hook but my talker is not sending
non-newline terminated lines (or the magic prompt format ones) meaning that
the hook doesn't get called.

Thanks.

Hmm, don't you have some script or something dedicating aliases for a
particular world? Sometimes you want let's say alias hungry working as "eat
apple" on world x and "eat mushroom" on world y, where the worlds are open
at the same time in the same tf window. Sure it's possible to savealias as a
send hook and add -wx and -wy like below:

/def -i -wx alias_body_hungry = eat apple
/def -i -p1 -ag -mglob -wx -h'SEND {hungry}*' alias_call_hungry = /shift
$[alias !~ "old"]%; /alias_body_hungry %*

/def -i -wx alias_body_hungry = eat mushroom
/def -i -p1 -ag -mglob -wy -h'SEND {hungry}*' alias_call_hungry = /shift
$[alias !~ "old"]%; /alias_body_hungry %*

but ... well, it's quite an ugly way. I think some optione like:

/alias -wy hungry eat mushroom should be added. Besides it would be nice if
all the aliases from the file dedicated to the world (from addworld line)
should be executed in the way described in a file only in that world.

just my 2 cents

Not in 4.x.  But version 5.0 will automatically preserve attributes in %Pn
and most other string operations.

The order is irrelevant.  The decision is based on priority.  The
highest priority trigger is called; if it's not fall-through, the
search stops there.  If it is fall-through, the search continues to
lower priorities.  If multiple non-fall-through triggers have the same
matching priority, one is chosen at random.  (See /help priority.)  So,
make the prompting trigger higher priority and fall-through.

BTW, if you want a space at the end of your prompt, you'll need to use
the function form prompt() instead of the command form /prompt, as in
the example below.

/def -p999999 -F -mglob -t'*' = /test prompt("Juggler: ")

TF does not see the actual keys you type; the terminal translates the keys
into characters, and TF sees the characters.  I don't know what kind of
terminal you are using, but most terminals I've seen generate the same
characters for F-keys regardless of whether or not Ctrl or Shift is
held down, so TF can not tell them apart.

I keep seeing you mention 5.0 for like 3 years.  I know you do other things, but
when do you plan to release it :) ?

hello,

is there any way you can update the
prompt/status_field when you're in
"Empty Socket"-mode, (/fg -n).

before the script used to create a
world to localhost:9 (wich is discard),
but everyone doesn't have that port
open, and shouldn't have either ;)

so the /fg -n was the only thing I
found out I could use, maybe there's
a better way?

hope ye understand my problem.
  orange.

Under tf it's possible to list some things and display information. I want
to produce a trigger basing on this, it's like in the example below.

Let's say after "/listdef -t" I can see a list like this:

% 934: /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^ablah' bold_blah1 = say 1
% 937: /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^bblah blah blah2' bold_blah2 = say 2
% 990: /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^cblah blah blah3' bold_blah3 = say 3

Now I prepared a trigger like this:
/def -mregexp -t"^\\% [0-9]+: /def (.*)-t\\'\\^([A-za-z]*[ A-za-z]+)\\'
bold_[A-za-z]" trig_checker = /setenv whatever=%P2
/alias sss /trig_checker $(/listdef -t)

Well, what I wanted to do was to run a trigger on a list of triggers, find
this with a proper name (bold_[A-az-z]) and set words from in " ' " as some
variable (whatever).

The problem is that when I run trig_checker checked is whole the list of
triggers (actually command:

"trig_checker % 934: /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^ablah' bold_blah1 = say 1 % 937:
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'^bblah blah blah2' bold_blah2 = say 2 % 990:
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'^cblah blah blah3' bold_blah3 = say 3"

 is executed, not:

"trig_checker % 934: /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^ablah' bold_blah1 = say 1"
 then
"trig_checker % 937: /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^bblah blah blah2' bold_blah2 =
say 2"
 then
"trig_checker % 990: /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^cblah blah blah3' bold_blah3 =
say 3"
 as I would like to

It's like with /kill command for instance: /alias sss1 /kill $(/ps -s) will
kill perfectly all the processes for me, but when I have processes' numbers
let's say 1 2 3 4 it will execute a commands "kill 1 2 3 4" killing them,
when the after list after /ps -s is of course:
1
2
3
3

I want to grab the text from the screen line by line and check them with my
trigger. Only some time consuming methods come to my mind, could you advice
me something?

I guess you want to do something like this:

I'm trying to use an expression like:

/expr fwrite("foo", "bar")

in a trigger.  It works, but every time the trigger fires I
get a 1 on a line by itself.  After trying a few things I'm 
guessing it's a return code from fwrite?  Is there a good 
way to get rid of this?  I tried to take the cheap way out
and just gag it but that didn't work so well.

You want /test, not /expr.

	When using prompt hooks on muds that use telnet GA sequences, it seems
tiny.fugue freaks out and thinks it is seeing two prompts.

	I have tested this on two muds. They both sent the prompt in one packet,
and than the GA sequence in the next packet. I'm not sure how this would behave
if they came in he same packet, but it should not make a difference.

/def -h'PROMPT *' prompthook=/test prompt({*})

	Try that on a mud like.. achaea.com 23, and you will always have a 
blank prompt, because it gets the normal prompt, than when the GA sequence
comes in, it than processess a totally blank prompt.

Work around:

On Achaea, all prompts end with a dash.

/def -p10 -h'PROMPT *' nullprompthook=/test prompt(oldprompt)

/def -p20 -h'PROMPT *-' prompthook=/set oldprompt=%*-%;/test prompt(oldprompt)

	Also, it seems on prompt hooks at least, it seems to consider the ANSI
codes as part of what the result returned. So a colored prompt is hard to 
decypher. Is there a built in tiny.fugue way to strip ANSI codes from strings?
Or at least ignore them when matching triggers?

Hi.
While writing a script i've met such problem:
I have var_1 and it's value is 5. I have also var_2 and it's value is
string - "var_1". Now, i want to make var_3's value equal 5 only using
var_2. In code it should be sth like this:

/def z = /set var_1 5%;\
	/set var_2 var_1%;\
	/set var_3 $[{var_2}]

Unfortunatelly var_3's value is string "var_1" - value of var_2. The
question is how to make the script to take value of var_2 not as it value
but name of another variable. Any ideas?

Kalreg.

/def z = /set var_1 5%;\

        /eval /set var_3 $$[{%var_2}]


Kind of ugly, but it seems to work.

try this
/test var_3:=\{%var_2\}

it also works in general
e.g.

/let i=2%;\
/test var_3:=\{var_%i\}


first the %xx substitution is performed with the result:
/test var_3:={var_1}
and then the macro is executed
/test var_3:={var_1}
with assigning var_3 the value of var_1

/eval is one way to to it, although %{} variable sub would be simpler than
a $[] expression sub:

	... /eval /set var_3 %%{%var_2}

/test also works, because the macro body does one expansion, and then test
evaluates its arguments as an expression.  However, the brackets are not
needed (and even if they were, they wouldn't need to be backslashed):

	... /test var_3 := %var_2

(After macro expansion, this becomes "/test var_3 := var_1", and /test
evaluates the expression.)

/set pattern=blah blah
/set attributes=-aCBred -aCbgred
(cannot really be used:	/set attributes="-aCBred -aCbgred"
			looks clearer and nicer that way..?)

/def %{attributes} -t"%{pattern}" = /echo wow
(then I loop this with variables changing)

There's no need to get it adapt to new situation when variables change
(ie. pattern changing from "blah blah" --> "woo woo" will happen, but
triggers don't need to change. So I want to change the variables into
strings before executing def). I will set these variables in the
beginning of the file. The point is that I'm reading those variables from
file but don't know how to use them with def. I found an example:

/def -F -mregexp -p7 -t"^%{tmp_target} leaves ([a-z]+)\\\\.$$" do_follow=
%%{P1}

...but it doesn't work for me (if it should work as I want it to). Could
someone show how to do what I want to do or even point to helpfiles
containing required information?

quick question, is there a list archive for previous posts, remember
seen this asked before and didnt see/missed a reply.

ok, working on the clock in the status prompt, currently the clock
displays the time for the system, I'm looking to add hours to the
value to display the game time and the time in a couple of other
timezones.

the times stored in @world but it doesnt seem to respond like a normal
variable, am i doing something wrong or is there a special way to do
it?

Thanks,
Neeps

/help status

@world is a variable which can be monitored; to make use of it, you
need to define a matching format variable, status_int_world.  The help
for "status" gives the defaults to look at.

@world is a worldname, ${world_name}; it doesn't itself contain a time
value.  Perhaps something like storing the timezone offset in var
tzoff_worldfoo and then having a WORLD hook which does something like:
 /set status_int_clock strcat(ftime("%H:%M", time()), "_", ftime("%H:%M", t=
ime()+tzoff_worldfoo))
but constructed to make tzoff_worldfoo dynamically.  Make sure to change
the field-width, @clock:11.

I wish to start the playing of sounds from triggers. The /sh or /sys
looks like they could be used -- but I am not interested in the return
values, I just want to fire off the commands and then get control back
to TF immediatly. How can that be done?

I use the same mechanism for my URL autolauncher, which works just like y=
ou=20
want. Just stick a '&' at the end of the command:
   /sh cat scream.wav > /dev/audio &

Your actual command for playing audio may vary.

Realistically, you probably don't want the extra messages that /sh spits =
out,=20
so use /sys... but /sys doesn't like the &, so you need to add one level =
of =20
script indirection (unless someone knows how to make it work directly), l=
ike=20
so:

  /sys playsound scream.wav

then have a 'playsound' script that looks like:

i wrote MSP patch for TF with Martin Thompson's MCCP enabled TF, you can get
the modified TF source from http://pdragon.org then click on the down button
to scroll the toolbar down, then on 'PD sounds' and on the tf download button.

I have once created a .tf-file which can play sounds on triggers in a
certain MOO, which can be found at:
http://www.blauwscherm.nl/tf-scripts.phtml

For playing wave-files, I have done the following:
/def subshell = /sys (%* > /dev/null 2>&1 &)
/set waveplayer=/usr/bin/play
/def play = /if ({1} !~ "") /eval /subshell %{waveplayer} %* %; /endif

Kind Regards,

Hi.
I have such problem: When i make defs that run another defs i often want
to have many commands in second def. Unfortunatelly it doesnt work as i
wanted to work.
Example:
/def -t'*Kalreg*' kalreg=/def -t'*John*' john=/set john 0%;/echo John is
Here! 

Idea of this trigger is that when i see 'Kalreg' it runs a trigger that is
listening to the mud for 'John' word. And when John is met it sets value
and echoes message to the screen. That's idea. In practice it works that
when Kalreg income from mud it turns on looking for John. When john is met
it sets its value to 0, but message is echoed to screen everytime /kalreg
is executed, not - as it was intended - when /john is executed. How to
make echo executed by john, not kalreg without any special changes of
structure of defs?

Kalreg

Just a note to everyone, I have sold the Druware.com domain name and
have/am moving all of my TinyFugue work back to the website of my day
job and company, Satori & Associates, Inc.  This is unlikely to ever go
away, so this is more or less a permanent home for my TinyFugue work.

http://www.satori-assoc.com?product=tf 

I'd also like to mention that the version to be found there has been
updated and now supports /sys and /quote properly, as well as having an
updated installer.  In the next couple of weeks I will be bringing the
the BeOS/BONE and an updated OS/2 version of TF online as well.

Allright, as Andy Satori has adviced me - i've done my defs. It looks sth
like this:

/def 1 = /def 2 = /eval /set var $[++var]%%;\
        /echo Ok - %var %;\
        /echo Def is on.

How should be: When i type /1 i have message "Def is on" and def /2 that
makes increasing variable is done. 

How is: When i type /1 variable increases instead of evaluation of def /2.
Messages correctly comes to screen, but maths that are the most important
thing here doesnt work? How to make them working?

I don't quite understand it by Control-U (kill line) doesn't appear to work.

Control-V Control-U will work but that's not really the same. :)

I've been doing Control-A Control-K for the same effect but when I use
screen I start killing screens instead of clearing lines.

Anybody have an idea what's wrong here?  ^U is certainly bound:

% 2: /def -i -b'^U' = /DOKEY DLINE

Thanks.

I couldn't tell you for sure, as it works for me, but if you give your system
information, I'm sure someone could answer you.

When you use the program 'screen', it intercepts the ^A for it's own use, ie
^An will take you to the 'next' screen.

In order to use ^A, you will either have to send it as the meta character
(^Aa^K) or change the control character in screen.

As far as I am aware, TF just passes through characters, so if you cannot use
^U anywhere, then I would suspect either the shell or screen.

You can get more information about using the meta character and key bindings
in screen by typing 'man screen' in your shell session.

This is a self extracting installer, and has been added to the Web
pages.  Please use, abuse and and document any issues.  

TinyFugue is a Terminal application, so please don't even bother trying
to run it from the GUI, it won't work.  I apolgize to the Netscape
users, the website was originally developed by a braindead programmer
that failed to see the world beyond IE.  I will be working to resolve
that issue in the coming weeks :-)

Someone recently asked me if a new version of tinyfugue has been released?
I responded "why? 4.0 works? Why does there need to be a new version? :)"
This got me thinking about wen 4.0 actually came out... it was mid 1998!
Over three years ago!

This has to be the longest-running version of a signifigant program I've
ever come across. (Programs that /need/ to be updated, but haven't, don't
count. Silly things like Minesweeper don't count, either :) Ie, 'stable 1'
is a severe understatement.

A big congratulations to Ken, and anyone else involved with development
and testing, for such a cool, useful, and above all, stable program!

Point of clarification - ^Aa is enough to pass through ^A.

I've enjoyed the stability of tinyfugue a lot.  While other mudders out there
would be complaining their client crashed and stuff, I must say TF has never
crashed on me since I been using it since early 97/98.

I don't like screen using ^A so I changed it to ` which is a lot easier -- I
find -- even though I do lots of shell programming.

Unfortunately, it does work in shells spawned from the same screen.

Which I've read a bit of. :)

Oddly I appear to have fixed ^U by removing and creating the particular
screens I had running tf.

Need to investigate more to find out how I managed to disable ^U though.

Thanks all.

Something that I've noticed, and I'm not sure if it is a bug or not.
The MUD I play has output of:

line 1

line 2

line 3

With /log, the text file has
line 1
line 2
line 3

Is this intentional?

Hi,
two questions:

is there a way to get the prompt the user has currently set
there is no variable prompt that holds the prompt and prompt without
parameters sets the prompt to the empty string

second:

is there a way to call builtin functions after overwriting them as
functions
/test @name() doesn't work

Michael

Hi,
after trying to figure out why /result 1?1:0 doesnt' work,

another mudder told me to try /result 1?1 :0
(see the space before :)

testing this further I encountered that the notation 1:0 is interpreted as
an time value (in this case 1 hour 0 minutes)

Just try /result 1:0
it will display 3600 -> 3600 sec

I didn't find this in the documenation (/help expressions) but I think
it's quite useful.

Perhaps it should be noted in the doc of
expr?expr1:expr2.

Have fun

I'm completely confused on macros. I come from a non-programming 
background, so, that contributes to it :).

I'm looking for information on a macro that sends a count my game every "x" 
amount of time, for a set number of calls. The count increases by 1 each 
send. There is a max count that ends the count sequence. It begins from 1 
the next time I run the macro.

So, something like this:

set <count> to 1.
set <end-count> to 10.

Send say <count which is 1>
increment <count> by 1.
Wait 10 seconds
Send say <count which is 2>
increment <count> by 1
wait 10 seconds

end loop after saying 10.

If I call the macro again, it will start at 1.

Gwen

Hmm perhaps you are looking for something like this:

/def count = \
	/set counter=0%;\
        /repeat -10 %1 /test ++counter,send(strcat("say ",counter))%;

a more simple approach would look like this

/def count = \
; if a parameter was given
	/if ({#} > 0) \
; set variables
	  /set counter=0%;\
	  /set end_counter=%1%;\
	/endif%;\
; if end not reached call itself in 10 seconds without params
	/if (++counter<=end_counter) \
           say %counter%;\
	   /repeat -10 1 /count%;\
	/endif%;

Below is a pair of macros that takes lines from a
seperate file and randomly selects one to send to the
world.

;;;
/def -i random_file_line = \
    /let selection= %; \
    /let lines=0 %; \
    /quote -S /random_line_ '%* %; \
    /_echo %{selection} 
/def -i -q random_line_ = \
    /test rand(++lines) | (selection := {*})
;;;

What I'd like to do is update the macro so that
instead of reading a seperate file, it reads a list
that is configured by world. I would enter the list as
part of the following sample macro (so that I can have
different randomizers based on different worlds):

;;;
/def -p3 -F -1 -w"gis" -h"CONNECT" random_file_gis = \
    /quote -w `/random_file_line gis_tee.tf
;;;

What modifications need to be done to change it from
reading a file (in this case, 'gis_tee.tf' and instead
read a list of possible options such as:

&teeshirt me=foo1
&teeshirt me=foo2
&teeshirt me=foo3

Nice Randomizer, quite a cute thing, but I don't know if your random is
really random and if rand never returns 0 (may be the case) there will be
no selection line?

How would you like to configure the list from the mud? Storing it there
and echoing from the mud in any form?
Then you would have to use triggers to catch the list:

something like this:
/def catch_random_list = \
	/set lines=0%;\
	/set selection=%;\
	/set catch_random_list=1%;\

/def -E(catch_random_list) -t"&teeshirt*" -mglob t_catch_random_list = \
	/random_line_ %*%;\
	/if (selection!~"") \
	  /set catch_random_list=0%;\
	  %{selection}%; \
        /endif%;

This would have a slightly other behaviour that your version as it stops
after finding the first selection but it would work.
The problem is that waiting for the list to be fully catched you must
either use a timeout that disables the trigger and does the action
afterwards or a special line denouncing the end of the list must be sent
from the mud.

What I'm surprised about is that changing the local variable selection and
lines within random_line propagates to the calling macro. Should this be a
result of using quote?

I run TF on two different systems. One is a NT box,
the other is linux.

I have individual .tfrc files on each machine, with
settings/macros unique to each machine, and then I
have one 'world.tf' file that has all the joint
settings in it. This works very well. However, I am
trying to merge everything into one file as much as
possible, since it is difficult to upload to the linux
box.

I saw a message come through once about how to
configure macros based on what the 'home' dir for tf
was set on that machine. (Someone else out there has
'dual machine' configurations.) I can't find that
message, now.

*SOOOOOO*, does anyone know how to set up a check to
test 'what' the home dir is, and do one thing if the
home is set to one specific path, and another thing if
it's set to *any other* home path?

Here is a sample macro I would need to see edited:

/def -Fp5 -h'connect' connect_doing = /repeat
-w${world_name} -1 1 /dorand

I would want to see it edited to look like:

On connection test home dir. 
If home dir is <foo1>, then, send "@doing At work.
@set me=Idle_Prone". 
If home dir is *not* <foo1>, then "/repeat
-w${world_name} -1 1 /dorand"

If I have the initial test, I can then edit all my
dependant macros on my own based on their own specific
conditions :).

Tf strips white space out of the configuration files
as part of the process of reading them. 

So, if you have files with alot of white space, and
alo tof macros, it quickly becomes difficult to find
the exact line, if you're trying to search based on
the error message line number.

How do other people out there deal with this? Is there
an editor that also strips white space? Is there some
other feature that helps get around this?

The "new watch" replacement by D. Moore
(http://oj.egbt.org/dmoore/tf.html) requires that you
load replace.tf

However, this is not in my tf-lib, and I do not see it
anywhere on the site.

Is this an "old" library that's been removed? Is this
a library I have to hunt down from another tf user?
Has it been renamed to something that *is* in the
standard distribution?

Any information on this would be appreciated, as I
would like to get /new_watch up and running. :).

Gwen

replace is now part of tf-lib in 4.0, and doesn't need separate file
included.

with serious, motivated people who are ready to make changes in
their life NOW! And because of the time we spend with each of
you as we help you get your business off the ground, we have
limited number of openings available. Here is what you need to
do...

This business fell into my lap in September of 1997. I got
started as a customer and woke up when my wife made an extra
$500 in the first week. At the time I was an Active Duty Marine
living paycheck to paycheck making less that $19,000 a year. I
was attending college at a local University and had two
children. $500 at that time would have been a dream come true. I
got started and in our first month I earned $2700 profit, and in
the first four months my wife and I made $19,000 profit.  I had
made more in 4 months than I made in an entire year as an active
duty Marine just part time working 10 - 12 hrs a week.

The average person can start earning any where from $25.00 -
$75.00 an hour from their home or office computers without
dedicating allot of time and effort. Most of us have been
thinking it's about time we took advantage of this Internet
Craze.  Through out the Holidays and especially the last year,
every thing that we have seen on Television and heard on the
Radio has either started or ended with www. -----------. Com and
the reason why is because the Internet has truly simplified
shopping, convenience which frees up more time for all of us to
turn that time into quality time. Security and convenience has
been technologically advanced to give us all the piece of mind.
E-Commerce is so rampant right now that most of the states in
the U.S. are buying their groceries over the Internet

This is your opportunity to take advantage of the E-commerce
that is literally changing the way the world does business.
Internet Marketing Group will show you how you can work at home
using your very own e-commerce storefront.  Our opportunity is
the only business of its kind right now.  It's growing by leaps
and bounds and you can be a part of it while you work at home.
The Work at Home Network with our company was reviewed and
published Wall Street Journal, Business Week, Home PC, Forbes,
Success, and Money, just to name a few.  You can work at home
and use the Internet to run your business.  You can market our
high demand consumable products that are geared and driven by
the needs of over eighty- percent of the world's population.
Our products sell them selves, so there is no selling or need
for out right sales techniques.  Also because they are high
demand consumable products, return business, on going business,
and referral business is generated.  By working at home, you
reduce overhead, set your own schedule, be your own boss, and
achieve your own goals.  Be an entrepreneur, WORK AT HOME!

The Market Opportunity is colossal. Over 1/2 of American homes
have a computer, and E-Commerce sales are increasing month on
month.  America is looking for a better way to buy our products
and now with this opportunity you can.  The Work at Home Network
a brand of e-commerce that is enabled and energized.  The five
top industries in the world are Medical - Health  - Nutrition,
Computer, Personal Care, Communication and the Burial Businesses
due to the Baby Boomers.  The Work at Home Network put them all
into a package except for the Burial Business.  Our industries
are guaranteed to be the fastest growing industries for the next
18 years and each year sales have doubled almost tripled.

If your country is listed here, you are eligible to start doing
business immediately.  (Argentina, India, Cyprus, Greece,
Poland, Australia, Hong Kong, Russia, Austria, Indonesia,
Portugal, Belgium, Israel, South Africa, Botswana, Italy, Spain,
Brazil, Jamaica, Swaziland, Canada, Japan, Sweden, Chile, Korea,
Switzerland, Czech Republic, Lesotho, Taiwan, Denmark, Mexico,
Thailand, Dominican Republic, Namibia, Turkey, Finland, The
Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, New Zealand, United States,
Germany, Norway, Venezuela, Philippines, Ireland, Panama,
Morocco, and China)

However, if your country is not listed here, it does not mean we
won't be there very soon. Because our company is expanding into
several countries a year, yours could be the next one to become
available. This is an optimal position to be in, one that you
will definitely want to take advantage of. Due to the fact that
countries can "open" only once in our industry, if you are one
of the first to receive this valuable information and one of the
first to start softening your market, you will belong to an
exclusive group of wealthy leaders. Our experience in 50
countries confirms this fact.

One of the strongest aspects of our business is the on going
training that is offered. We have International Training's on an
ongoing basis in most major cities. Weekly conference calls are
also available, as well as satellite television training
programs, monthly magazine's and quarterly journals. Our company
does over 1.5 billion US Dollars in business annually and you
too can be a part of this growth.  Maybe some of you have tried
other businesses and failed. We welcome you with open arms. Here
you will find success because we give you the blueprint to
follow and support you need to develop your own profitable
home-based business. All we ask of you is to be coachable and be
willing to learn. We have no need for tire-kickers or window
shoppers.  Please do not request our "decision package" if you
are not serious about changing the course in your life right
now. By ordering your "decision package", you will receive all
you need to get yourself moving towards financial independence.

So, if you are tired of worrying about money and tired of
choosing what you can live without, come join the thousands of
us working from home, setting our own schedules, making a
fortune and living out our dreams. We invite you to explore how
the "Work From Home" Internet Program capitalizes on today's
advancements in technology to help you build a successful
home-based business.

Have you noticed the surge of people looking to start home-based
businesses?  Did you know that 32 million households now have
home-based businesses and that number grows every day? Have you
asked yourself, "Why?" Why are so many people, including
yourself, interested in working from home? Our parents never
searched for a business to operate from home nor did their
friends. So, why now and why is it suddenly so popular?

Americans are "cocooning". We want to spend less time on the
busy freeways commuting, and in over-crowded shopping malls and
replace that with spending more time at home with our families
where it is warm and safe. Apparently, we trust society less and
want to protect ourselves and our families from the "cruel"
outside world. This is the wave of the future and we are
beginning to realize with the advancement in technology, we do
not need to be in an office environment in order to access the
marketplace and make money.  In today's world, the quickest way
to build a home-based business is to take advantage of the
Internet craze that has hit the United States and is quickly
spreading around the world. Like how the Gutenberg Press
radically changed the communication world in 16th Century
Europe, the Internet is revolutionizing how we communicate,
distribute information and the manner in how and where we spend
our money. It has been said that those who pursue electronic
commerce (business over the Internet) have the opportunity to
build an explosive business.  While a conventional business can
cost thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up and
run successfully, an Internet business costs dramatically less
and has the potential to attract international business for just
a fraction of what the traditional company would spend. On
average, 30% of all U.S. web traffic is already international
and 5% to 20% of all web sales originate from outside the United
States. Everyday, these percentages are radically increasing.
Consumers worldwide are spending 6.6 billion U.S. dollars a year
in transactions over the Internet.  The awareness level and need
for users, buyers, advertisers and merchants to get onto the
Web, and to set-up shop, has dramatically changed even from one
year ago.  This medium of doing business is skyrocketing, and we
are reaping the benefits, daily.  If you combine the Internet
craze with people's desire to work from home and set their own
schedule, you have a powerful team, and here is why. Many people
have heard of SOHO, and no, we don't mean that hip section of
New York City, rather the S.O.H.O. which refers to "Small
Office/Home Office." One of today's biggest explosions in the
economy. The home-based business has been born out of necessity.
In an era where large corporations can only think of downsizing,
what are your options? There is no security in Corporate America
any more!  Not only are tens of thousands of workers and
managers being downsized out of their companies, but also
thousands of men and women are tired of the corporate "rat race"
and want to retreat to a home-based business.

If you decide to "stick it out" in Corporate America or the
Corporate World, your choices could boil down to finding a
lucrative niche in the small business world, standing in line at
the unemployment office, or accepting a cut in pay and benefits.
We were all raised to give 9 hours work for 8 hours pay, and we
are not backing away from that. Today's large companies have no
loyalty to the employees. Their only loyalty is to the bottom
line. And the bottom line is exactly where most of us are when
it's time to cut back. Your life is suddenly turned upside down
because you have no control over your future. Someone who has no
idea of the quality of your work makes these decisions behind
closed doors or the extra time you gave the company without
requesting overtime. They don't know about your family's life:
they don't understand that you just put braces on your child's
teeth and now have to pay for them. These "decision makers" job
is to be impersonal and unbiased in all areas except for the
company's "best interests." In other words: TO THEM, YOU REALLY
DON'T MATTER.

The Great American Dream is gone. Official U.S. government
reports indicate that more than 3.5 million jobs have been
eliminated in the past 10 years - including over 2000 jobs per
day last year alone - and an estimated 55% of all jobs created
in the next 10 years will be near minimum wage in stores,
restaurants, and bars. 90% of all the people in North America
earn less than $40,000 a year and today's two-income family are
not living as well as their parents did.  So what is the
alternative to the to the Great American Job? Richard Poe,
former senior editor for "Success Magazine," describes in his
recent book that a shift in thinking has resulted in over 14
million people working from home full-time, and another 13
million part-time. This number is increasing by almost 600,000
per year.  And the average work from home income is $50,250 per
year, about twice the average income of wage earners working for
someone else. By the end of the decade over 44% of us will be
working from home.

Home based business wage earner's success rate is over 85%
compared with small businesses like retail shops and
restaurants, at about 95% failure rate after 5 years. Couple
that with the flexibility we have to change our schedules and
set our hours and then those of us who are parents are now
available when our children need us, plus we no longer have the
need for the "foster homes" we call day cares, where the
care-givers get to see all the "firsts" your child performs.
There's no wonder the number of people looking to work from home
has skyrocketed.  This "New Era" of financial growth is largely
due to the latest technologies that are now available to those
who desire to work from home. Imagine what it would be like to
run an international operation if you so choose, right from the
comfort of your own home. Well, this is exactly what we offer!
We offer a "freedom" that is available through a constant flow
of income that does not depend on the whims of a boss, bonuses
or the economy.

Take a look at some of these statistics:  At age 50, 75% of the
population has less than $5,000 in the bank for retirement.  At
age 65, 45% of Americans depend on relatives, 30% depend on
charities, 23% are still working (most can't afford to quit and
work until they are no longer physically capable) and Only 2%
are self-sustaining.  At the present time, it is impossible to
support a family of two working full time at minimum wage!  For
the first time in history, the current generation is averaging a
lower standard of living then their parents!  Automation is
taking layoffs to record highs!

The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Out of 100 people that
start working at the age of 25, by the age of 65... - 1 is
wealthy - 4 have enough money to retire - 63 depend on social
security or charity - 29 are deceased 95% of people, age 65 and
over cannot afford to retire and work until they die!!  What
Happened to Safety & Security?  Why we no longer put our trust &
faith in "Big Business".  In J. Paul Getty's book "How To Get
Rich", his first rule for success is, "You must be in business
for yourself. You will never get rich working for someone else."
This partly explains why someone starts a new home-based
business in the United States every 10 seconds. In the past 14
years alone, the numbers of home-based businesses have grown
from 6 million to 32 million with no slow - down in sight. In
fact, an estimated 8,493 new home businesses open every day.
The United States is now driven by an information and service
economy. Over the past decade, Fortune 500 companies have laid
off 4.4 million workers while smaller companies steadily
continue to reduce their work forces.  As companies continue to
downsize and re-organize, many professionals will seek out and
search for new ways to take control of their careers. Many of
these individuals have forsworn traditional "nine to five"
office jobs and are making their homes pay off in more ways than
one.

For the entrepreneur, home-based businesses have become the
bridge between work- crazed big cities and easy- paced
family-oriented small towns. Link Resources Corp. reports that
market research shows more than 29 million people run either
full-time or part-time businesses from their homes. People used
to believe that their livelihood depended on living in big
cities near big corporations. That is no longer true, thanks to
personal computers, increased phone services, fax machines, and
the Internet, it is no longer necessary to live in close
proximity to "Big Business". You can now operate that "Big
Business" right from your home office.  Within the last five to
seven years, technology has been brought to an affordable level
so that almost everyone has an equal playing field in the
work-from-home industry.  Check out these Statistics:  11% of
the US market is now on the Internet 1,092,000 new people get
Internet access each week, while approximately 38% of the US
adult population, or 68 million US citizens' currently use the
Internet, according to the fall 1999 Cyber Status reports from
Mediamark Research Inc. This is an increase of 49% from the
prior quarter, and this study only counts people who have used
the Internet in the last 30 days.

Ziff-Davis's Technology User Profile reported that there are 60
million PC's connected to the Internet in the US, but home PC's
still represent the lion's share of the market, with 68 million
consumers hooked up to the Internet.  They predict that up to
$54 billion US dollars will change hands from business
transactions online by year 2001.

people need, and most of all, something people want. If you add

**********************************************

If you are unsure and need more information, we have put
together a "How to do business over the Internet" decision
package that will help you determine whether our business is for
you or not.  This step is only for individuals who have the
desire to control their own future and who want to work from
their homes and earn the kind of income that will give you the
life you deserve. This decision package contains approximately
three hours of information about our explosive Internet business
and it also begins your training. You will receive a manual that
explains how, why and what we are doing, a video where you'll
meet us and see exactly how our business works and an audiotape
to further help you with your decision. Your package also
contains the name and telephone number of your personal coach
who will be working with you on a daily basis, helping you make
money in your first week. In other words, you will receive all
of the information you will need to make a decision to determine
if this is for you.

After you request your "International Decision Package", and go
through all the materials, we will call you and your personal
training program will begin. At that point, we will also be
happy to locate the nearest training to you, which are available
in numerous translations. We have training being conducted in
over 27 different languages worldwide!  This package acts only
as a way for you to review information about our business and
begins your training without risk.  This step eliminates the
people who are not serious and allows us to work with those of
you who are. Please recognize the importance of this step. We
simply do not have the time to spend with people who are merely
curious, which is why we designed this package to provide you
with all of the information you will need to make a decision and
determine if this is for you. If we spent our time answering
e-mail requests for additional information, we'd not only be
duplicating the effort we put into developing the decision
package, but we'd also be taking valuable time away from running
our business and training new people. Once you start working
with us, we're sure you will appreciate our spending time
training you instead of responding to curious e-mails all day
long.

Since we don't spend countless hours answering the tireless
questions of the curiosity-seekers, you benefit, because it
frees us up in order to dedicate ourselves to your success. When
we spend time with you, we know we are working with someone who,
like us, is committed to a better lifestyle.  What is Your
Future Worth?  Decide for yourself and for your family what it
is you want and by when you want to achieve it.  Only you can
determine how dedicated you are to achieving your dreams.
Hopefully, you won't find yourself relying on your friends and
family for direction and salvation. They cannot provide that for
you - only you can do that. You need to make a decision to
either give this a shot or to continue down the path you're on.
Most likely, if you have read this far, you have already made
the decision to make some healthy changes in your life. When we
were looking at this "Work From Home" Opportunity for the first
time, just like you, we were nervous and thought that maybe this
wouldn't work. Like you, we doubted we could really achieve our
dreams. We went for it any way and now we are making incredible
incomes, working from home, and for most of us- it's a dream
come true. We don't have a boss to answer to or a clock to
punch.

All you need to do now is take action. Take action by ordering
your "Decision Package" and we'll be there to help you through
your questions and then to work with you to build your own "Work
From Home" Internet Business. But please don't request more
information unless you are committed to improving your life. If
you are ready to learn and you are serious about achieving a
brighter future and a better life, then we are committed to you.
We are ready to give you the same step-by-step plan we used to
build our fortune. There will be no surprises. We know exactly
what to do and how to coach others be successful within the same
system. Our Program works. It's already happening for hundreds
of people. Why not you? Right now, take the next step, and get
started on your way to a brighter lifestyle.

STEP 2: To get started or request your decision package only
after you have completed STEP 1 please call our international 24
hour order hotline at 1-206-222-2829.  International callers and
 for United States, Canada, and Mexico callers please also dial
1-206-222-2829.

We are willing to train you and work with you, as others have
done with us, to help secure your financial future. But,
remember, we only work with those that truly have the desire and
ambitions to work-we don't have time to work with couch
potatoes! Successful people do what unsuccessful people won't.

So develop a sense of urgency and give your desires value!
Procrastination is the biggest killer of success and you can now
break that cycle! REMEMBER, for things to change, you have to
change and for things to get better, you have to get better. Order
your materials today, and when they arrive, review everything
thoroughly BEFORE calling your personal coach.

Remember the importance of following directions- we are looking
for people who are teachable and willing to work. We're very
excited about our future and we know you will be, too!! Until we
speak personally, thank you and have a great day!

Again please follow STEP 2: To get started or request your
decision package only after you have completed STEP 1
please call our international 24 hour order hotline at
1-206-222-2829.  International callers and  for United
States, Canada, and Mexico callers please also dial
1-206-222-2829.

I can't speak about the propagation, but the mathematical logic behind th=
e=20
random selection is quite sound. It's a great way to shuffle a card deck,=
=20
too.  rand(x) returns 0 to x-1, so on the first line, when ++lines is 1, =
you=20
always get back 0.  Anyhow, if you have 'n' lines in the file, the cumula=
tive=20
chance of any line being chosen is 1/n, even when you don't know how many=
=20
lines there are in advance - try it with 3 lines:

Chance of the first line being chosen (and remains chosen) is 1 * 1/2 * 2=
/3 =3D=20
1/3.  Chance of the second line being chosen (and remains chosen) is 1/2 =
*=20
2/3 =3D 1/3.  Chance of the third line being chosen is 1/3 =3D 1/3. This =
works no=20
matter how many lines you work it out for. The only down side is that you=
=20
have to read through the entire file every time, instead of keeping an in=
dex=20
list, but it's good enough for this.

ARE YOU GETTING A BIT CURIOUS?

GREAT! That's fine... as long as you're serious! Because our
business is bursting at the seams, we ONLY have time to work
with serious, motivated people who are ready to make changes in
their life NOW! And because of the time we spend with each of
you as we help you get your business off the ground, we have
limited number of openings available. Here is what you need to
do...

This business fell into my lap in September of 1997. I got
started as a customer and woke up when my wife made an extra
$500 in the first week. At the time I was an Active Duty Marine
living paycheck to paycheck making less that $19,000 a year. I
was attending college at a local University and had two
children. $500 at that time would have been a dream come true. I
got started and in our first month I earned $2700 profit, and in
the first four months my wife and I made $19,000 profit.  I had
made more in 4 months than I made in an entire year as an active
duty Marine just part time working 10 - 12 hrs a week.

The average person can start earning any where from $25.00 -
$75.00 an hour from their home or office computers without
dedicating allot of time and effort. Most of us have been
thinking it's about time we took advantage of this Internet
Craze.  Through out the Holidays and especially the last year,
every thing that we have seen on Television and heard on the
Radio has either started or ended with www. -----------. Com and
the reason why is because the Internet has truly simplified
shopping, convenience which frees up more time for all of us to
turn that time into quality time. Security and convenience has
been technologically advanced to give us all the piece of mind.
E-Commerce is so rampant right now that most of the states in
the U.S. are buying their groceries over the Internet

This is your opportunity to take advantage of the E-commerce
that is literally changing the way the world does business.
Internet Marketing Group will show you how you can work at home
using your very own e-commerce storefront.  Our opportunity is
the only business of its kind right now.  It's growing by leaps
and bounds and you can be a part of it while you work at home.
The Work at Home Network with our company was reviewed and
published Wall Street Journal, Business Week, Home PC, Forbes,
Success, and Money, just to name a few.  You can work at home
and use the Internet to run your business.  You can market our
high demand consumable products that are geared and driven by
the needs of over eighty- percent of the world's population.
Our products sell them selves, so there is no selling or need
for out right sales techniques.  Also because they are high
demand consumable products, return business, on going business,
and referral business is generated.  By working at home, you
reduce overhead, set your own schedule, be your own boss, and
achieve your own goals.  Be an entrepreneur, WORK AT HOME!

The Market Opportunity is colossal. Over 1/2 of American homes
have a computer, and E-Commerce sales are increasing month on
month.  America is looking for a better way to buy our products
and now with this opportunity you can.  The Work at Home Network
a brand of e-commerce that is enabled and energized.  The five
top industries in the world are Medical - Health  - Nutrition,
Computer, Personal Care, Communication and the Burial Businesses
due to the Baby Boomers.  The Work at Home Network put them all
into a package except for the Burial Business.  Our industries
are guaranteed to be the fastest growing industries for the next
18 years and each year sales have doubled almost tripled.

If your country is listed here, you are eligible to start doing
business immediately.  (Argentina, India, Cyprus, Greece,

However, if your country is not listed here, it does not mean we
won't be there very soon. Because our company is expanding into
several countries a year, yours could be the next one to become
available. This is an optimal position to be in, one that you
will definitely want to take advantage of. Due to the fact that
countries can "open" only once in our industry, if you are one
of the first to receive this valuable information and one of the
first to start softening your market, you will belong to an
exclusive group of wealthy leaders. Our experience in 50
countries confirms this fact.

One of the strongest aspects of our business is the on going
training that is offered. We have International Training's on an
ongoing basis in most major cities. Weekly conference calls are
also available, as well as satellite television training
programs, monthly magazine's and quarterly journals. Our company
does over 1.5 billion US Dollars in business annually and you
too can be a part of this growth.  Maybe some of you have tried
other businesses and failed. We welcome you with open arms. Here
you will find success because we give you the blueprint to
follow and support you need to develop your own profitable
home-based business. All we ask of you is to be coachable and be
willing to learn. We have no need for tire-kickers or window
shoppers.  Please do not request our "decision package" if you
are not serious about changing the course in your life right
now. By ordering your "decision package", you will receive all
you need to get yourself moving towards financial independence.

So, if you are tired of worrying about money and tired of
choosing what you can live without, come join the thousands of
us working from home, setting our own schedules, making a
fortune and living out our dreams. We invite you to explore how
the "Work From Home" Internet Program capitalizes on today's
advancements in technology to help you build a successful
home-based business.

Have you noticed the surge of people looking to start home-based
businesses?  Did you know that 32 million households now have
home-based businesses and that number grows every day? Have you
asked yourself, "Why?" Why are so many people, including
yourself, interested in working from home? Our parents never
searched for a business to operate from home nor did their
friends. So, why now and why is it suddenly so popular?

Americans are "cocooning". We want to spend less time on the
busy freeways commuting, and in over-crowded shopping malls and
replace that with spending more time at home with our families
where it is warm and safe. Apparently, we trust society less and
want to protect ourselves and our families from the "cruel"
outside world. This is the wave of the future and we are
beginning to realize with the advancement in technology, we do
not need to be in an office environment in order to access the
marketplace and make money.  In today's world, the quickest way
to build a home-based business is to take advantage of the
Internet craze that has hit the United States and is quickly
spreading around the world. Like how the Gutenberg Press
radically changed the communication world in 16th Century
Europe, the Internet is revolutionizing how we communicate,
distribute information and the manner in how and where we spend
our money. It has been said that those who pursue electronic
commerce (business over the Internet) have the opportunity to
build an explosive business.  While a conventional business can
cost thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars to set up and
run successfully, an Internet business costs dramatically less
and has the potential to attract international business for just
a fraction of what the traditional company would spend. On
average, 30% of all U.S. web traffic is already international
and 5% to 20% of all web sales originate from outside the United
States. Everyday, these percentages are radically increasing.
Consumers worldwide are spending 6.6 billion U.S. dollars a year
in transactions over the Internet.  The awareness level and need
for users, buyers, advertisers and merchants to get onto the
Web, and to set-up shop, has dramatically changed even from one
year ago.  This medium of doing business is skyrocketing, and we
are reaping the benefits, daily.  If you combine the Internet
craze with people's desire to work from home and set their own
schedule, you have a powerful team, and here is why. Many people
have heard of SOHO, and no, we don't mean that hip section of
New York City, rather the S.O.H.O. which refers to "Small
Office/Home Office." One of today's biggest explosions in the
economy. The home-based business has been born out of necessity.
In an era where large corporations can only think of downsizing,
what are your options? There is no security in Corporate America
any more!  Not only are tens of thousands of workers and
managers being downsized out of their companies, but also
thousands of men and women are tired of the corporate "rat race"
and want to retreat to a home-based business.

If you decide to "stick it out" in Corporate America or the
Corporate World, your choices could boil down to finding a
lucrative niche in the small business world, standing in line at
the unemployment office, or accepting a cut in pay and benefits.
We were all raised to give 9 hours work for 8 hours pay, and we
are not backing away from that. Today's large companies have no
loyalty to the employees. Their only loyalty is to the bottom
line. And the bottom line is exactly where most of us are when
it's time to cut back. Your life is suddenly turned upside down
because you have no control over your future. Someone who has no
idea of the quality of your work makes these decisions behind
closed doors or the extra time you gave the company without
requesting overtime. They don't know about your family's life:
they don't understand that you just put braces on your child's
teeth and now have to pay for them. These "decision makers" job
is to be impersonal and unbiased in all areas except for the
company's "best interests." In other words: TO THEM, YOU REALLY
DON'T MATTER.

The Great American Dream is gone. Official U.S. government
reports indicate that more than 3.5 million jobs have been
eliminated in the past 10 years - including over 2000 jobs per
day last year alone - and an estimated 55% of all jobs created
in the next 10 years will be near minimum wage in stores,
restaurants, and bars. 90% of all the people in North America
earn less than $40,000 a year and today's two-income family are
not living as well as their parents did.  So what is the
alternative to the to the Great American Job? Richard Poe,
former senior editor for "Success Magazine," describes in his
recent book that a shift in thinking has resulted in over 14
million people working from home full-time, and another 13
million part-time. This number is increasing by almost 600,000
per year.  And the average work from home income is $50,250 per
year, about twice the average income of wage earners working for
someone else. By the end of the decade over 44% of us will be
working from home.

Home based business wage earner's success rate is over 85%
compared with small businesses like retail shops and
restaurants, at about 95% failure rate after 5 years. Couple
that with the flexibility we have to change our schedules and
set our hours and then those of us who are parents are now
available when our children need us, plus we no longer have the
need for the "foster homes" we call day cares, where the
care-givers get to see all the "firsts" your child performs.
There's no wonder the number of people looking to work from home
has skyrocketed.  This "New Era" of financial growth is largely
due to the latest technologies that are now available to those
who desire to work from home. Imagine what it would be like to
run an international operation if you so choose, right from the
comfort of your own home. Well, this is exactly what we offer!
We offer a "freedom" that is available through a constant flow
of income that does not depend on the whims of a boss, bonuses
or the economy.

Take a look at some of these statistics:  At age 50, 75% of the
population has less than $5,000 in the bank for retirement.  At
age 65, 45% of Americans depend on relatives, 30% depend on
charities, 23% are still working (most can't afford to quit and
work until they are no longer physically capable) and Only 2%
are self-sustaining.  At the present time, it is impossible to
support a family of two working full time at minimum wage!  For
the first time in history, the current generation is averaging a
lower standard of living then their parents!  Automation is
taking layoffs to record highs!

The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Out of 100 people that
start working at the age of 25, by the age of 65... - 1 is
wealthy - 4 have enough money to retire - 63 depend on social
security or charity - 29 are deceased 95% of people, age 65 and
over cannot afford to retire and work until they die!!  What
Happened to Safety & Security?  Why we no longer put our trust &
faith in "Big Business".  In J. Paul Getty's book "How To Get
Rich", his first rule for success is, "You must be in business
for yourself. You will never get rich working for someone else."
This partly explains why someone starts a new home-based
business in the United States every 10 seconds. In the past 14
years alone, the numbers of home-based businesses have grown
from 6 million to 32 million with no slow - down in sight. In
fact, an estimated 8,493 new home businesses open every day.
The United States is now driven by an information and service
economy. Over the past decade, Fortune 500 companies have laid
off 4.4 million workers while smaller companies steadily
continue to reduce their work forces.  As companies continue to
downsize and re-organize, many professionals will seek out and
search for new ways to take control of their careers. Many of
these individuals have forsworn traditional "nine to five"
office jobs and are making their homes pay off in more ways than
one.

For the entrepreneur, home-based businesses have become the
bridge between work- crazed big cities and easy- paced
family-oriented small towns. Link Resources Corp. reports that
market research shows more than 29 million people run either
full-time or part-time businesses from their homes. People used
to believe that their livelihood depended on living in big
cities near big corporations. That is no longer true, thanks to
personal computers, increased phone services, fax machines, and
the Internet, it is no longer necessary to live in close
proximity to "Big Business". You can now operate that "Big
Business" right from your home office.  Within the last five to
seven years, technology has been brought to an affordable level
so that almost everyone has an equal playing field in the
work-from-home industry.  Check out these Statistics:  11% of
the US market is now on the Internet 1,092,000 new people get
Internet access each week, while approximately 38% of the US
adult population, or 68 million US citizens' currently use the
Internet, according to the fall 1999 Cyber Status reports from
Mediamark Research Inc. This is an increase of 49% from the
prior quarter, and this study only counts people who have used
the Internet in the last 30 days.

Ziff-Davis's Technology User Profile reported that there are 60
million PC's connected to the Internet in the US, but home PC's
still represent the lion's share of the market, with 68 million
consumers hooked up to the Internet.  They predict that up to
$54 billion US dollars will change hands from business
transactions online by year 2001.

business owners are happier running their own business versus
working for someone else.  92% recommend working from home to
others.  94% plan to still be running their own business in five
years.  20% of home entrepreneurs reported that their businesses
grossed between $100,000 and $500,000 last year.  23% paid
themselves annual salaries of $65,000 to $350,000.  41% work at
home with other family members.  71% think their businesses are
doing as well or better than they expected.  79% expect their

If you are unsure and need more information, we have put
together a "How to do business over the Internet" decision
package that will help you determine whether our business is for
you or not.  This step is only for individuals who have the
desire to control their own future and who want to work from
their homes and earn the kind of income that will give you the
life you deserve. This decision package contains approximately
three hours of information about our explosive Internet business
and it also begins your training. You will receive a manual that
explains how, why and what we are doing, a video where you'll
meet us and see exactly how our business works and an audiotape
to further help you with your decision. Your package also
contains the name and telephone number of your personal coach
who will be working with you on a daily basis, helping you make
money in your first week. In other words, you will receive all
of the information you will need to make a decision to determine
if this is for you.

After you request your "International Decision Package", and go
through all the materials, we will call you and your personal
training program will begin. At that point, we will also be
happy to locate the nearest training to you, which are available
in numerous translations. We have training being conducted in
over 27 different languages worldwide!  This package acts only
as a way for you to review information about our business and
begins your training without risk.  This step eliminates the
people who are not serious and allows us to work with those of
you who are. Please recognize the importance of this step. We
simply do not have the time to spend with people who are merely
curious, which is why we designed this package to provide you
with all of the information you will need to make a decision and
determine if this is for you. If we spent our time answering
e-mail requests for additional information, we'd not only be
duplicating the effort we put into developing the decision
package, but we'd also be taking valuable time away from running
our business and training new people. Once you start working
with us, we're sure you will appreciate our spending time
training you instead of responding to curious e-mails all day
long.

Since we don't spend countless hours answering the tireless
questions of the curiosity-seekers, you benefit, because it
frees us up in order to dedicate ourselves to your success. When
we spend time with you, we know we are working with someone who,
like us, is committed to a better lifestyle.  What is Your
Future Worth?  Decide for yourself and for your family what it
is you want and by when you want to achieve it.  Only you can
determine how dedicated you are to achieving your dreams.
Hopefully, you won't find yourself relying on your friends and
family for direction and salvation. They cannot provide that for
you - only you can do that. You need to make a decision to
either give this a shot or to continue down the path you're on.
Most likely, if you have read this far, you have already made
the decision to make some healthy changes in your life. When we
were looking at this "Work From Home" Opportunity for the first
time, just like you, we were nervous and thought that maybe this
wouldn't work. Like you, we doubted we could really achieve our
dreams. We went for it any way and now we are making incredible
incomes, working from home, and for most of us- it's a dream
come true. We don't have a boss to answer to or a clock to
punch.

All you need to do now is take action. Take action by ordering
your "Decision Package" and we'll be there to help you through
your questions and then to work with you to build your own "Work
From Home" Internet Business. But please don't request more
information unless you are committed to improving your life. If
you are ready to learn and you are serious about achieving a
brighter future and a better life, then we are committed to you.
We are ready to give you the same step-by-step plan we used to
build our fortune. There will be no surprises. We know exactly
what to do and how to coach others be successful within the same
system. Our Program works. It's already happening for hundreds
of people. Why not you? Right now, take the next step, and get
started on your way to a brighter lifestyle.

STEP 2: To get started or request your decision package only
after you have completed STEP 1 please call our international 24
hour order hotline at 1-206-222-2829.  International callers and
 for United States, Canada, and Mexico callers please also dial
1-206-222-2829.

We are willing to train you and work with you, as others have
done with us, to help secure your financial future. But,
remember, we only work with those that truly have the desire and
ambitions to work-we don't have time to work with couch
potatoes! Successful people do what unsuccessful people won't.

So develop a sense of urgency and give your desires value!
Procrastination is the biggest killer of success and you can now
break that cycle! REMEMBER, for things to change, you have to
change and for things to get better, you have to get better. Order
your materials today, and when they arrive, review everything
thoroughly BEFORE calling your personal coach.

Remember the importance of following directions- we are looking
for people who are teachable and willing to work. We're very
excited about our future and we know you will be, too!! Until we
speak personally, thank you and have a great day!

Again please follow STEP 2: To get started or request your
decision package only after you have completed STEP 1

1-206-222-2829.  International callers and  for United

/sh, even with -q, redraws the screen, which is annoying.
Any solution involving a subshell has extra overhead.

Best solution:  /quote -0 -decho !your_shell_command

The shell command may contain redirection, but should NOT use & to put it
in the background.

Hi,
did anyone of you use require in the .tfrc
When I tried it it loaded the given file twice, I suppose this is a bug,
is it fixable?
Testet on linux and windows (98)

I use /require to get the path the file is loaded from to set an internal
path variable for it. /load doesn't set any parameter values when loading
a file

e.g.
/require ~/tf-macros/file.tf

...
content of file.tf

/set filepath=$[substr({1},0,strrchr({1},"/"))]

Michael

I solved the problem :)
It seems as if tf executes the last command of a loaded file twice if the
file doesn't end with a newline :)
and as /require was the only command in the .tfrc file ...

Ave!

i've downloaded irc script for tf, byt i can't force it to work.
it connects to irc server, but every command causes an error:
: irc.server.addres 451 * :You have not registred
and after some time:
ERROR :Closing link: [my@host.ip] (ping timeout)

i dont know if it's because my script is old and not finished (1998 y)
or because of my server (it hasn't any irc cliend installed).

Could enyone tell me how to run the script, or send mi a working irc
script?

When i'm writing scripts on any unix/linux editor i have no problem with
whitespaces, but DOS/Windows editors are setting whitespaces at the end of
every line, so on win i use Notespad editor, which has DOS->Unix
convert bulit in.
Notespad editor is freeware, and ya can download it somewhere on the net

Hi,
when trying to expand the abilities of the status line I encountered
something that looks like a bug with nested tests

Try this:
/set a=test(b)
/set b=echo(21)
/def x=/echo $[test(a)]

the expected result appears only with a error message: (a tf-win of
another tester crashed)
21
% x: expression syntax error: expected operator, found ')'.
1

if b is set to:
/set b=echo(1)
it works without any error,

everytime the length of b exceeds 7 tf throws an error message

try:
/set b=echo("test")

Any Ideas where to look for a solution?

Thanx,

Michael

/set a=test(b)
/set b=echo(1)
/def x=/test $[test(a)]
Strange, it seems that if the string length of b exceeds the string length
of a tf throws the error, if the length of b is equal or less than the
length of a it suceeds

/set a=test(0),test(b)
/set b=echo("test)
works as well but
/set b=echo("testtest")

doesn't work as variable b is one character longer than variable a

perhaps it is a stack problem or something like that?

You don't need eval for this:

/def get_array = /return %1%2
/def put_array = /if ({#}>2) /set %1%2=%-3%; /else /unset %1%2%; /endif
/def purge_array = /quote -S /unset `/listvar -s %1*
/def list_array = /listvar %1*

I recommend marking the array variables as special like this: otherwise
you could confuse it with other variables named similiar.

/def get_array = /return _%1_array_%2
/def put_array = /if ({#}>2) /set _%1_array_%2=%-3%; \
	/else /unset _%1_array_%2%; /endif
/def purge_array = /quote -S /unset `/listvar -s _%1_array_*
/def list_array = /listvar _%1_array_*

If you use text not containing other characters than letters,numbers and _
you may also use this as an simple key-value hash list
e.g. /set_array weapon s1 sword_with_a_very_long_id

/def wield = /get_array weapon %1%;wield %?

usage:
instead of: wield sword_with_a_very_long_id
just use: /wield s1

You may store anything to be abbreviated in these lists, e.g. weapons,
friends, npcs, scores etc

Hope it helps

Thanks I changed the 3 functions, the one with /quote should speed it up quite
a bit

   Seems like there are no special editors for tf out there. I've always
used vim for building triggers, but begun to wonder if there are other
choices. However, I couldn't find one via search machines. I'm running
linux but software for Windows goes also. Well, guess one doesn't need
anything special for code building, but if anyone knows some useful editor
I'd appreciate at least getting the name of it.
   Or then I'll have to code one, huh.

Tuukka,

I have found vim to be the most useful editor on linux.

For code editing there are several different syntax colorizers distributed
with vim, including one for tinyfugue.

Ken also has a vim syntax file linked from his homepages which he has
improved.

The other editor which people have said is good is 'jed'. I have never used
this, so cannot give any report on it's usefulness.

I ask questions here from time to time to improve my
understanding of macros.

I'm trying to write a macro that will react to
wildcard matching and then plug the variable result of
the of the first wildcard match into the rest of the
macro.

Here's what I mean: 
I want to match on the phrase: The crystal is * in
size and is *.

The first "*" (which can be up to two words), I want
to grab as a variable to send to my game. In this
case, "get <variable>" and then "@wait 0=give
carton=<variable>".

It would look something roughly like this:
/def -w'ss' -t'The crystal is * in size and is *.'
pack2 = \
/send -w'ss' get <variable1> %;\
/send -w'ss' @wait 0=give carton=<variable 1>

I hope this question makes sense?

Gwen

Take a look at /help %1.

/def -w'ss' -t'The crystal is {*} {*} in size and is *.' pack2 = \
  get %3 %4 %;\
  @wait 0=give carton=%3 %4

You could also do it with regexps thusly:

/def -w'ss' -mregexp -t'^The crystal is ([^ ]+ [^ ]+) in size \
  and is .*\\.$' pack2 = \
  get %P1 %;\
  @wait 0=give carton=%P1

Better to suffer the fate of Sisyphus and use multiple `echo 'c' >> file`,
than to blaspheme the good name of editors and use emacs. :)

I'm still a ViM person.  I just don't like having to issue
Ctrl-Alt-Esc-backslash-Shift-chicken sacrifice-S to save a file. :)

Bah, that's why they call it hairy chested programming.  

Seriously though.

On Windows:
  Object Edit supports a tf syntax right out of the zip file 
    and can save properly terminated lines.
  MED can be quickly modified by the user to support TinyFugue Syntax
highlighting.

On Linux:
  Emacs can support tf syntax, but I've not seen it done yet.
  VIM support tf syntax with

On BeOS:
  Pe Saves properly, no Syntax Styling
  Eddie saves properly, no Syntax Styling

On MacOS X:
  VIM is your friend


If you are looking for something a little more in depth, say something
more like the zMud or Rapscallion editors, then you'd need to work with
someone to build it.  I think Will Lashell's Crescendo had the
fundamentals of one.  

On the flipside, I've been tinkering with one in Delphi/Kylix, but I'm
now thinking that I'm going to stop that and start over in C/C++ so that
I can do something a little more portable to Windows, Linux and MacOSX.

Just a note: ViM is available for all the platforms you mentioned, as well
as 80 or so more, supporting syntax highlighting on them all. :)

I read an earlier post in here.
said to do a /def -ag hACTIVITY
and /def -ag hBACKGROUND
so I do that then /fg
Then I see % trigger in world.

Is there a way to make it 100% quiet no screen scroll at all when doing
/BG ?

Also does anyone know if it's possible to temporarly turn off logging
then turn it back on or is that impossible ?

ViM allows pasting between multiple editors as well.  I'm lazy as well.

Actually, saving is ctrl-x, ctrl-s in emacs, versus <esc> colon W
<enter> in vi. Emacs uses fewer keystrokes than vi for most common
things.

That said, it takes longer to learn emacs, and many of the more
advanced commands are downright cryptic if you don't dig into the
elisp. Nobody learns to use emacs well in under a year, but once you
master it, you can do 1,000 things in emacs for every one thing you
can do in vi.

The difference between vi and emacs users seems to be that vi users
are concerned with the idea of editing text, whereas emacs users are
obsessed with the idea of the editor itself.

There is nothing you can do in Emacs that you cannot do in ViM.  Vi was
weak.  ViM is strong.

If you can name one thing that Emacs can do that cannot be done in ViM, I
will never comment on this again. :)

Saving can also be done with ZZ (in command mode), as a shortcut for :w -
save-and-quit is ZQ (rather than :wq).

vim rocks.

*coughs*  <esc> gets you out of insert-mode.  It's a noop in
command-mode.  But in colon-mode, it's equivalent to Enter, so if the
bottom line shows ``:! rm -rf ~/'' it's inadvisable to blindly just
press Esc.

My experience has been the reverse.  And I used to write elisp functions
to do some funky local tasks -- I may have to think hard to remember how
to use Emacs these days, but I do have experience from both sides of the
camp.

vi and derivatives have a hideously steep initial learning curve.  If
you are someone who will be doing a lot of text-editting, investing the
time to get over the curve can be well worthwhile, simply because of the
efficiency you get when you're strongly familiar with vi.  That takes a
lot of time, it's simply not sensible for many light users.  Such people
benefit from pico/nano/whatever.  Personally, I like vim.  Which reminds
me, there's some Ugandan children waiting on my getting around to
actually donating ...

Uhm, whaaaa?

'ZZ' in command-mode is equivalent to 'wq' or 'x' in colon-mode.  'ZQ'
is equivalent to 'q!' in colon-mode.

Okay, I was going to told my tongue (fingers?), but this is starting to
drive me batty.  :)

It's not "ViM".  Vim, VIM, or vim is acceptable, but ViM is incorrect.

I'm a very avid Vim user.  I did try to learn to use Emacs at one point
and gave up after a while.  I do know that there are plenty of things
that Emacs can do "out of the box" that Vim can't.

In any case, I've seen these editor wars all over the place, even on the
Vim mailing list.  I'd rather not see it happen again here.  You'd think
people of both "camps" fear they'll be the only one using their editor
if they don't convince everybody to use /their/ preferred editor.

Choose your editor(s) based on your needs, and ignore people who try
"convert" you by simply saying their editor can do things yours can't,
or worse, by attacking you.  That's the nature of software; tools vary
in functionality, even if they're similar.  Choice is a good thing.

As to Tinyfugue, I've been a longtime user of TinyFugue and a longtime
reader of this list.  I've never been a big TF coder (there isn't really a
lot I need to do, aside from connect to multiple windows and such), and my
init files are very sparse.  The things I /do/ use *all* the time - and,
in fact, sometimes even try to use in my [OS] shells - are:

kbstack - wow.  I have no words to describe how useful this package is.
worldqueue - same thing, minus one point five words missing. A macro to
translate rot13 A macro to ping and then traceroute the world I'm
connected to

And...wow!  The most useful set of /default keybindings/ I've ever had the
pleasure to use.

A big huzzah! to Ken Keys and all past and future maintainers of
TinyFugue.


As to the below, I have one comment and one comment only:

All Hardware Sucks.  All Software Sucks.  Vaccum cleaners also suck.  The
trick is knowing what task requires what sort of sucking.

Glad someone finally corrected me on that.  I never paid TOO much
attention to it and now it bites me in the butt.

No-one has ever been able to tell me one thing that Emacs can do that Vim
can't.  Everyone always tells me that there exist things, but no-one has
specifics.  Like you said, it's more important that you like your editor.

Anyway, I have nothing against other's editors.  Use your favorite tool.  
I'll use mine.

I see we have little war here :)))
I've been writing macros and scripts to TF since 1999 and found a couple
of good editors. For now, i use EditPlus2 for windows. It has many good
functions - customizable syntax highlight, column select, saving CR/LF in
Mac, Unix and Windows style (what is very good to avoid sucking ^M signs
at the end of line). It also has options to trim whitespaces
automatically. You can download it from www.editplus.com.
While writing scripts on linux console i just use joe editor. Maybe it's
not the best, but for fast edit is enough.

I don't understand this.  I done this a long time ago with cygwin and it
all compiled no problems at all.

Anyone know what the problem is ?

and I do have a c:\home, c:\bin and a c:\bin\sh.exe
for some reason the shell command is not taking unix syntax ie //c/home
which should be the same a c:\home

This is one of the major reasons I've not been as update happy with the
Cygwin binary release on Druware, now Satori-assoc.com.

I have been slowly reworking tfselect.c/h to support Windows native IO.
If I can get that complete and working, I'll be able to eliminate the
Cygwin dependancy altogether.

At the moment, I've got it compiling but crashing after the first read
from the socket.

newer versions of cygwin use /cygdrive prfix by default

How do they expect people to run linux or unix type apps if the //c/ stuff
doesn't work anymore ?
I tried that mount stuff, but I need the exact command to make it so //c/
works.

well... you can easy access any files under the cygwin directory.. but
you could try this:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Cygnus Solutions\Cygwin\mounts v2\/c/home]
"native"="C:/home"
"flags"=dword:0000000a

after adding this into the registry //c/home should work

how correlates possibilty to compile/run unix/linux apps with some
non-standart path ? personally i don't remember anything about //c/path
in Linux Filesystem Standart.

however you may try somthing like `mount -b c:\ /c` to have drive c:
mounted on /c, but it will works only with soft compiled with/for cygwin
because it implemented in cygwin1.dll, any windows soft will have to
use windows paths obviuosly.

if you need exact command to make smth work, i think you should provide us
with exact information about what you trying to do :)

general command/instructions:
download setup.exe from www.cygwin.com, 
install cygwin,
have fun :)

HTH,
Dmitry

PS. maybe cygwin-ml is better place for this discussion ?

I'm not a linux expert but //c is the equivilant of windows or dos c:\
I used linux off and on and that has always been the way paths worked.

I guess cygwin is not all that compatable with linux software anymore if you
have to hack the registry to
get software such as tinyfugue to compile under it.

Install tinyfugue is simple if it works.
You download it from http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/#UNIX
then you do:
1.gzip -dc tf-version.tar.gz | tar -xof -
   2.cd tf-version
   3.more README

after that you do:
sh unixmake install
If cygwin was truely linux/unix compatable this would of ran without a hitch.  I
even tried it under cygwin command prompt.
That didn't work either.  So just made c:\home and c:\bin and c:\bin\sh.exe
shell cmd in it.
Set my paths to them and the home paths as well to c:\home.

What I found later is that for somereason it doesn't like //c/home which is
suprising.

Then why is "sh unixmake install" trying to do //c/home instead of /c/home ?

Hi,
To use the site I want I have to use the following

same thing??

telnet -s identidy.com  (site_i_want_to_conect_to)

I'm looking for a way to match information on multiple lines.

A game I play on has characters recovering a commodity called "crystal" for 
sale. The crystal can be recovered in different sizes, shapes, and colors. 
There is a "market report" that changes every few days.

Here is a sample report:
==============================================================================
       Crystal Market values ( shown in order of most valuable to least )
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
color:
   amethyst, black, white, yellow, blue, rose, and green

shape:
   cone, rectangle, dodecahedron, prism, cylinder, octagon, pentagon, and 
pyramid

  size:
   very large, medium large, large, medium, tiny, medium small, very small, 
and small

                  Data last updated:  Tue Oct 16 09:44:05 2001
==============================================================================

I would like to set attributes on my character as the market changes (I 
presently track this by hand on paper), on the values of the colors, 
shapes, and sizes.

My first question is, how do I to grab information that's on the line 
"following" the appropriate category. For example, I know I can match for a 
line beginning with "color:", but, the value by color is on the "next" 
physical game line. How do I grab that?

My second question is, I only want to grab the information when it changes 
(which is *not* daily). The line on the bottom of the market report 
indicates when it was last updated. I "know" how to grab the present date 
and compare them, but, how do I hold the market information in "memory" 
until I know for sure I want to place it on my character?

Any help on this is appreciated :).

the list these days)

Hello world,

> I'm looking for a way to match information on multiple lines.

Afaik it cannot be done in a simple way. I solve this problem
(in fact, I've to solve it so many times I actually began to
believe in inprovement and TF5 ;)) the following way:
  
- Build a trigger matching line 1 with priority X
  |    
  +--- which defines the trigger matching line 2 with priority X+2 and
  |    is doing the important stuff e.g. assigning new values to global
  |    variables.
  |
  `--- wich also defines a trigger matching *any* line with priority X+1
       having only one goal: Kill the trigger above in case the 2nd line
       did not appear.

It would look like (not tested example, but you will catch the idea)
- and YES, I don't like any triggers not being fall-thru ;-) :
    
/def -iqFp100 -msimple -t"color:" market1 = \
  /def -iqFp102 -mregexp -t"^   ([a-z][a-z]*), ([a-z][a-z]*), \
      ([a-z][a-z]*), ([a-z][a-z]*), ([a-z][a-z]*), ([a-z][a-z]*), \
      and ([a-z][a-z]*)$$" market1_sub1 = \
    /set MARKET_VAL1=%%P1%%;\
    /set MARKET_VAL1=%%P2%%;\
    /set MARKET_VAL1=%%P3%%;\
    /set MARKET_VAL1=%%P4%%;\
    /set MARKET_VAL1=%%P5%%;\
    /set MARKET_VAL1=%%P6%%;\
    /set MARKET_VAL1=%%P7%%;\
    /def -iqF1p103 -mregexp -t"^                  Data last updated:  " \
        market1_update = \
      /let tmp=%%%PR%%%;\
      /if ( tmp !~ LAST_DATE ) \
        /set LASTDATE=%%%tmp%%%;\
        /do_the_very_important_update_stuff%%%;\
      /endif%;\
  /def -iqF1p101 -mglob -t"*" market1_undef = \
    /purge -i market1_sub1

If you *know* that there will be the needed line 2, you may simplify
this to just defining a one-shot.

       `--- which defines another trigger matching the 'Data'-line, 
            causing output/action.

(append it above, please ;))

At least I hope it's helpful. ;)

There's no need making the third trigger ('witch also defines a ....')
Instead of doing it ya should just define the second trigger as a one-shot
trigger (/def -n1 ...) this trig undefines itself after first use.

Sir, with respect, Sir, negative, Sir.
I don't just diskike non-fallthru triggers. I even less like any
triggers active I surely do not need. Here the 2nd trigger (triggering 
the 2nd line) would not only stay active until the damned line would 
appear (eh-bah, a regexp-trigger...): He would snap on the next line 
looking like the one he's waiting for...  even if the line appears 
*without* the first one. It is neccessary to remove or deactivate the 
trigger - to make it a oneshot doesn't solve the problem.

Regards,
    Adrian

Hi,

why does neither -mglob -t"" nor -msimple -t"" match empty Lines sent from
the mud. Instead it matches EVERY line.

Only -mregexp -t"^$" seems to match empty lines.

This seems like a bug in tf.

Michael

Why?

You've asked tinyfugue to match against a string of zero length.  Every
line is a string.  By definition, every string contains one or more
substrings of zero length.

You want to have tinyfugue match lines where _only_ a string of zero
length matches.  That's exactly what the anchored regexp above gives
you.

Tinyfugue is behaving correctly.

I doubt this.
A simple match should only match if the entire line is described by the
matching pattern. Therefore a empty string pattern should only be matched
with a empty line.

The same for globs.

You wrote about contained strings of zero length, but unlike regexp glob
and simple matching don't care about contained strings.

I reproduced this myself in tf-40s1.  I'm afraid I don't have a fix for
4.x, but I can tell you that it is fixed in 5.0 (not yet released).
(Unfortunately, the fixed code can not be simply dropped into 4.x,
since the interpreter was largely redesigned for 5.0.)

You are missing the "-" before the "h" option.  Also, I recommend naming the
macros.  Thus:
    /def -ag -hACTIVITY gag_activity
    /def -ag -hBACKGROUND gag_background

There is are no simple commands that mean "suspend logging" and "resume
logging"; you just have to use "/log [options] off" and "/log [options]
[filename]".

The "G" (norecord) attribute may do what you want.  If a line matches a
trigger with "-aG", that line will not be recorded to any logfile.
For example, to prevent logging a block of text that begins with the line
"begin spam" and ends with the line "end spam", define a macro like this:

    /def -aG -t"begin spam" begin_spam = \
	/def -aG -p1000000 -t"*" nolog_spam%; \
	/def -n1 -aG -p1000001 -t"end spam" end_spam = /undef nolog_spam

I mean't to the history buffer.  Not log file. Sorry.
Any way to send stuff to the screen without being sent to the history buffer ?

-mglob -t"" and -msimple -t"" SHOULD match only empty lines.  The fact that
they match all lines is a bug, and will be fixed in 5.0.

-mglob -t"{}" and -mregexp -t"^$" both match only empty lines, as expected.

On a related note:  TF 5.0 will have a "substr" matching option.
-msubstr -t"foo" will match any line CONTAINING "foo" (whereas -msimple -t"foo"
would match only lines that are exactly "foo").  -msimple -t"" would match
all lines, since all lines contain "".

Actually, I meant history buffer too.  -aG prevents lines from being recorded
in the history buffer (so they won't show up in /recall); it does NOT prevent
them from being logged.  Using -aG on a trigger prevents matching mud lines
from being recorded, and using -aG on /echo lets you display a line without
it being recorded.

Any predictions, dead-chicken magic chants or guesses as to when 5.0
will be ready for alpha release?

I've been playing with MCL, and really like the windowing capability and
the perl extensibility.  Anything like that showing up in 5? :)

Sorry, setting the client's address is not possible in the current version
of TF (40s1).  It will be in version 5.0.

Yes, this was a bug (although it's easy enough to avoid by making sure your
files always end in a newline).  This will be fixed in 5.0.

improved my scrollback util a lot.  Much smoother scroll line by line
now.  But the stupid % activity in world messages mess it up and the the

After a question like this appeared quite often, thought it would be nice
to have a macro (file) that is able to cope with several solutions like
this.
Generally a concept like the one Adrian proposed can be used to accomplish
such a thing. I tried to combine several macros I wrote to catch lines of
text from the mud into one powerful macro that is able to cope with many
situtations (and is extensible).

For your problem the solution using this macro file should be as simple as
this:
/def -t"*Crystal Market values*" trig_market_values = \
	/trig_grab -b"*color:*" -vcrystal_color -e"{}" -aCblue -M/echo%;\
	/trig_grab -b"*shape:*" -vcrystal_shape -e"{}" -aCblue -M/echo%;\
	/trig_grab -b"*size:*" -vcrystal_size -e"{}" -aCblue -M/echo

/def -t"*Data last updated:  *" -mglob trig_marked_date = \
	/let update_date=%-3%;\
	/if (update_date!~market_last_update_date) \
; to save marked_last_update_date over sessions you may write it to an
; file and load it after tf starts or also set is as a property in you
; char
	   /set marked_last_update_date=%update_date%;\
; do anything with the variables crystal_color, crystal_shape,
; crystal_size here
	/endif%;

;HELP: info Grabs lines from the mud output, beginning with a starting line (-b) catching the next lines (body -y) up to an end line (-e). The whole thing is controlled by 3 triggers
;How can the catched text be used: Either a macro name is given by the -M option. This macro is called with the grabbed text as parameter line. The text is also stored in a variable (can be set by -v default is fulldetail (historically)). The separate lines are concatenated by @{N} by default or the delimiter given with (-d) (@{N} is used by an extension of echo that converts those to newlines). When using quote mode (-q) the given macro is called for each line of grabbed text (much like quote)
;The triggering and grabbing is stopped after:
; a number ob body text lines (-n)
; a certain time (-t)
; after a second command send to the mud produced an output (see variables mud_custom_prompt, mud_custom_prompt_response)
; it is also possible to specifiy the number of commands send to the mud whose output shall be catched (e.g. the quality of different spells each listed by a separate command)
; Which lines are catched is defined by -c (b beginning line, y BodYlines, e endline, eg. -cy (default) for only body lines, -cbye for all, and -cby for only the starting line and the body lines)
; if the trigger texts (-b, -y, -e) are prefixed the matching mode can be determined by the prefix (r# regexp, g# glob, s# simple).
;by using -C a command can be given whose output shall be catched, alternatively this command can be send before calling /trig_grab

;HELP: examples
;/trig_grab -b"g#*--------" -e"r#^-+$" -M/echo  -q -ag -cbye -Cinfo

;/trig_grab -b"g#*--------" -e"r#^-+$" -M/echo -d# -ag -cy -Cinfo
;only catches the body lines (see -c) and no start/end line and outputs these per echoing them after catching the whole thing (lines concatenated by #, see -d)

;/trig_grab -e"r#exits?:" -Clook -M/scan_room -aCred -d" "
; grabs the room description of the actual room, colors it red (-aCred) and calls a macro named scan_room (see -M) with the whol description as parameter (lines separated by a single space

Hi!
While calculating some values, i was trying to divide by zero, and special
text appeared on screen:

% division by zero.

Is there a way tu avoid this message?

Kalreg.

Don't divide by zero?

Seriously.  Just check to see if the denominator is zero before doing
the division...

You have to be in raw mode for it to work.

if you use /recall -aG -g -q 1-100 for example.

the recalled text will go into the history buffer.  but if you ommit the
-q it won't.  -aG means don't put anything into the history buffer.
some how -q bugs this out.

I want to be able to write say /recall -g 100-200 to a disk file.
Are there ways to do this ?

I know one way is to /log and /recall but I rather not do it this way.

I've had some really good help from people on the list
lately, and, have one question that builds on previous
questions and ought to help me with several things at
once.

I've been trying to do some regexp matching on
different things. One issue that comes up regularly
for me is situations were I might have to match on one
word *or* two (it varies between those two) and then
grab those words for a later expression.

How do I configure the match and %P calls to reflect
this.

Sample phrases:

Joe walks in with a cool drink.
Joe walks in with a big cool drink.

I want to grab what kind of drink it is and send the
message 'steal <'cool' *or* 'big cool'> drink' to the
game, depending on which message pops up.

/def -w'jane' -F -p5 -mregexp -t"^Joe walks in with a
([a-z]*) drink." pack2 = \
/send -w'jane' steal %%P1 drink

This is untestet, but should work. Just a quick hack, no erreor
checking.

/def hist_to_disk = \
	/set handle=%; \
	/test handle:=tfopen('/path/to/hist_log', 'w')%; \
	/def write_line = \
		/test tfwrite(handle, {*})%; \
	/quote -S /write_line `"/recall %1"%; \
	/undef write_line%; \
	/test tfclose(handle)

Now call /hist_to_disk 200 and the last 200 lines of your history should
be written to /path/to/hist.

To force it to be either one or two words, no more,

 ([A-Za-z]+( [A-Za-z]+)?)

Also, note that inside a double-quoted string, that needs to be \\. at
the end.

The ' ' character will only match a single space; if the MUD sometimes
isn't exact in its whitespace handling, then you might want to change
that to ' +' or '[ 	]+' (space and tab).

Jens' and Michael's methods probably work (I didn't test them, but
they look ok), but there's a simpler method using more advanced
utilities provided in the library (you have to "/require textutil.tf"
before you can use it).  Unlike /quote, the pipe (%|) preserves leading
and trailing spaces, and is also more efficient.

  /eval /recall <recall_options> %| /writefile -a <filename>

If you want a simpler command line, you can define:

  /def recall_to_file = /recall %-1 %| /writefile -a %1 
        
and then use:

  /recall_to_file <filename> <recall_options>

I believe that the overhead involved in processing each trigger makes the
first option preferable to the second.

You may wish to optimize it further by using the regexp
\[(inform|suomi)\]:

The imrpovements made are much better smoother scroll back
when using up/down arrow keys.
Also % world messages don't arrive while in scroll back.

I hope one day TF comes with built in scrollback so one doesn't
have to do all this frigging coding :) Enjoy.
===========================================
;Scroll back history tool
;Version 2.10 Galvin
;
;PgUp brings you into the scroll back; places the world in the background;
;     also it pages up thru the scroll back one page at a time.
;PgDn Does the same as above except it doesn't activate scroll back.
;control - T to jump to the top
;control - B to jump to the bottom
;control - Q to exit the scroll back
;
;NOTES:
;Make sure scroll_history_size is set to the what ever /histsize is set
;to, if not the scroll_back will be flakey :)
;the /FG and /BG may cause problems for people using mulitple worlds.
;till I find a way to supress output but have it buffered this is the
;only way I know how.
;If anyone knows of a better way to turn off activity messages or trigger
;messages from other worlds let me know.
;thanks.  The code may be a little buggy but am using it regulary now.

;==============================================================================
;This function is to be used if you want to write stuff directly into 
the input
;buffer.  This will automatically break long lines up into multiple 
lines so they
;show up in the scroll back correctly.
;USAGE:
;InputHist_MultiLine("this is a string of text", ScreenWidth)
;The string will be broken into even segments of screenwidth
;NOTE: You need to write stuff you type into the keyboard into the 
history buffer
;      if you want to see it in the scrollback.
;to make such a macro that can catch every you type this is how:
;/def -ag -mregexp -F -h'SEND ^.*$' chat_send = \
;  /test InputHist_MultiLine(strcat("> ",{P0}), 80)%;\
;  /test send({P0})
;======================================================================

What I want to do is add to the setup I already have which creates an
extra feild when an active world appears __(Active: 1) xr_
I am using the variable %active_worlds which is created with the
worldqueue.tf lib. what I want it to say is the world+number of lines
unread in that world ____(Active: 1) xr22 fan5 myworld6________

I know that the nactive() thing can do it but I have been unable to get it
to work. any ideas how


Below is my setup:

I have a regexp match that pairs with certain phrases. I'd like to adjust 
it to match the keywords I specify, UNLESS there's a specific *other* word 
that follows.

Here is the present macro:

/def -i -F -T'tiny.cm' -p55 -abBCmagenta -mregexp 
-t"(glint|Flickers|flicker|glimmer) of (light|crystal)" cm_vein

I would like to adapt it to match: (glint|Flickers|flicker|glimmer) of 
(light|crystal) (*Not* one of the words in this delimited list 
word1|word2|word3)

I don't see any "not" pattern under regexp matching.

Gwen

Make a higher priority trigger that does nothing when it matches the
anti-pattern.

You may also find that -E is helpful, by doing something like:
-E'!regmatch("(word1|word2|word3)", {*})'
along with your -t for the positive matching

I just wanted to apologize for writing the mailing list twice. I didn't get 
*any* e-mail from the list on the 7th, including my original question or 
any responses, so, I sent it again assuming the first had gone 'missing'.

You can't do this with a single regexp.  You have to use a higher priority
non-fallthru trigger to block the lines you don't want matched:

/def -T'tiny.cm' -p56 -mregexp 
-t"(glint|Flickers|flicker|glimmer) of (light|crystal) (word1|word2|word3)" \
not_cm_vein

/def -F -T'tiny.cm' -p55 -abBCmagenta -mregexp 
-t"(glint|Flickers|flicker|glimmer) of (light|crystal)" cm_vein

Or use an /if inside the trigger body:

/def -F -T'tiny.cm' -p55 -abBCmagenta -mregexp 
-t"(glint|Flickers|flicker|glimmer) of (light|crystal)" cm_vein = \
    /let line=%P0%; \
    /if (!regmatch(line, "(glint|Flickers|flicker|glimmer) of \
    (light|crystal) (word1|word2|word3)") \
	/substitute -abBCmegenta %line%; \
    /endif


In 5.0, you'll be able to do this:

/def -F -T'tiny.cm' -p55 -abBCmagenta -mregexp 
-t"(glint|Flickers|flicker|glimmer) of (light|crystal) (?!word1|word2|word3)" \
cm_vein

That first line should be:
/def -F -T'tiny.cm' -p55 -mregexp \

drop us a features list of what to expect, what to drool for etc :)

hello all.
I have a macro (listed below) that is attached to a trigger so that when
I gain a lvl in the MUD it automatically writes it to a file so that I
can keep track of my levels (it also has the option of deleting input if
i want it to):
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'^You gain (.*) hit points, (.*) mana, (.*) moves,
and (.*) practices.' level=/vitaelevel %P1 %P2 %P3 %P4%


The problem is that when i start up TF i have to load up the file:
/load vitaelevel.tf

and i get the spam out put of what is IN the file:
25 15 6 5
20 12 6 8
24 17 9 8
22 14 6 8
23 10 7 8

now expand that by several pages and u can see how it is annoying.  For
the life of me i can't figure out WHAT exactly is causing the output.  I
thought:
/def -hload -ag ~gagload
/load vitaelevel.tf
/undef ~gagload

would do it but it dont.
Any ideas? (I also have one for my quests which i do about 20 times more
than levels.....now imagine the spam on THAT one :-(.   Everyone says hi
to me before the spam finishes.)

;; CrystalMUSH auto-remove carton

  /def -w'ss' -F -mregexp -t"^Carton ([0-9]) - Ssudia is loaded in to the 
sled." carton_loaded = \
    /set carton_count=%{P1} %;\
    /set carton_count2=(++%P1) %;\
    /send -w'ss' remove carton %;\
    /send -w'ss' take carton %{carton_count2}

The above isn't working.

My goal is to grab %P1 and add one to it (that's what I'm trying to do with 
the carton_count and carton_count2), then send that result to the game.

You need to get into a math/expression mode, so you probably want:
/set carton_count2=$[{P1}+1]

I'm not sure you want /set carton_count2=$[++{P1}], since that will
also mess with P1 in some potentially strange way.

This is a further explanation to how i would like to be able to remove 
certain triggers and then load the normal ones.

Say for an example you are entering a dangerous area and want to load 
triggers specific to that area.

Then also when leaving that area you no longer want those triggers to be 
active, is there a way to do this?

I have put below how i thought you could do it if there is a command in tf.

Can someone tell me if there is such a command or if there is another 
way to do it.


This is an extract from my .tfrc file:

;<------------------------>
; NORMAL MODE
;<------------------------>
;; These files contain the normal everyday aliases, macros, trigs used
;; while wandering around.
/load norm_macros.tf
/load norm_alias.tf
/load norm_trigs.tf
/load hilite.tf

;<------------------------>
; COMBAT MODE
;<------------------------>
/def combat = /load combat_trigs.tf

;<---------------------------------------->
; EXITING COMBAT MODE, RETURNING TO NORMAL
;<---------------------------------------->

 /def normal = /unload all %; /load ~/.tfrc

/purge removes all macros

should remove all triggers

see /help purge

the options are the same as list's

Gwen,


I have not tried the following, but it should work for you.


/def -w'ss' -F -mregexp -t"^Carton ([0-9]) - Ssudia is loaded in to the sled."
carton_loaded = \
 /test carton_count := %{P1} + 1 %;\
 /send -w'ss' remove carton %;\
 /send -w'ss' take carton %{carton_count}

Peter,

Just wrap the actions in an 'if' statement and it will effectivly dissable
them until the test passes.

Something like the following where I have two tests befor the actions :-

/def -mregexp -p30 \
  -t'A magic mushroom suddenly appears' auto-inv-mush2 = \
  /if ({class} =/ "Cleric" | {class} =/ "Paladin") \
    /if ({mymush} == 1) \
      /set mymush 0 %; \
      /send take mushroom %; \
      /send put mushroom %{cont2} %; \
      /test count_mushroom := count_mushroom + 1 %; \
    /endif %; \
  /endif

In this trigger, only if the class of my character is a Paladin or a Cleric
will they react to the text from the game. The 'mymush' variable is set when
the character casts the spell so they only pick up their own items.

For your use, you could do a check for 'fightmode' or some other variable that
you set when you need the triggers.

/unload_all would be /purge -mglob *

Bu I think a better way is, if all of your triggers for that specific
area have their names starting with a common prefix. Then you could
remove all triggers for that area with /purge -mglob common_prefix*,
without purging and reloading all your other triggers.

Hi

I was wondering if anyone could tell me if once you have a large amount 
of triggers loaded
ie you have a combat.tf file and a normal.tf file for walking around.

Is there a way to unload all your triggers/macros etc and then reload 
only the ones you want?

I use aliases changing the chance for triggers, like below:

/alias tron /edit -c100 %1
/alias troff /edit -c0 %1

Then if I  have a trigger: /def -mglob -t "Rach" mbor = say ciach

I can switch it off manually with: "troff mbor" and switch on with: 'tron
mbor". When you want to activate a set of triggers for a particular area you
can make it with "tron" or just load a file with them (loading not active
triggers - chance 0 - will change the chance to 100). When you need to
switch them off you can run an alias doing it, like:

/alias deactivate_area1 troff mytrig1%; troff mytrig_2%;troff ...


           Maro
I hope it's what you wanted.

I'd just like to point out that if you use attributes on your triggers,
i.e for gagging or coloring certain lines, then -c might not be the best
sulution...

from the "/help def":
"  -c<chance>
           Sets the percent probability of executing the body of a matched
           trigger or hook.  (The macro still counts as a match for attributes
           and priority even if it does not execute.) Default: 100%."

So you might still get colored lines or block other macros even tho the
macro(body) wont execute. In these cases, use the -E switch instead
(expression) instead. Just change your aliases to something like this:

/alias tron /edit -E"1" %1
/alias troff /edit -E"0" %1

You might even want to group your macros, use something like this

/def -E%combat dummy1
/def -E%combat dummy2

then "/toggle combat" to switch between on and off.

Erhm... nuff said. :)

quick request, i've written a trigger to capture data from a line and
write it to a file, is there a flag/option to capture the entire line
that it triggers off?

Thanks

Hello all!

I'm quite new in programming in tf and cannot stand against
one problem :
I want to make something like that :
./tfrc
	...
	/set in TO_SET
	/set out TO_SET
	/set hit TO_SET
	/def DOITon = /def -p110 -F -mregexp -t'ACTION' autoinout1 = ! %out %;\
        /def -p110 -F -mregexp -t'ACTION2' autoinout2 = ! %out %;\
        /def -p110 -F -mregexp -t'ACTION3' = ! %in %; TO_DO %hit

The problem is that when I set variables and run "/DOITon" tf in ACTION3
sets the trigger up to %in and starts the command TO_DO (it should be as
second part of trigger.
When I del that and run from hand :
"/trig *ACTION3* = something%; second_something"
it works fine ....

Thanks for any help ;P

I'm looking for an easy way to update my .tfrc to
include something that forces '/log off' to mean
'/log -w${world_name} off'.

I never want to turn *all* my logging off at once,
however, I hate having to type the above string when I
do want to shut one log off for some reason. 

Gwen

%{*} is the entire line that triggered the macro.

I have a list of 13 things that will increase or decrease as time goes
on.
What I need is to randomly send ALL of them to the MUD in one shot.

/alias list lists$[rand(1,13)]
/alias lists1 item 1
/alias lists2 item 2
/alias lists3 item 3
/alias lists4 item 4
/alias lists5 item 5
etc

I know that "/repeat 13 list" will just do it randomly and i could get
item 10 10 times...not likely but possible.
What I would like is that lets say the 1st thing that comes up is item 3
then on the next randomiziation 3 wont come up...until all are done. 
kinda like:
[rand(1,13) except for 3] then repeat until all 13 are done.
I started an excel file with all the possible combos and it is
impossible to do easily.  I ran outta room.

/alias list a$[rand(1,13)]
 /alias a1 item 1%;b$[rand(1,12)] %*
  /alias b1 item 2%;bb$[rand(1,11)] %*
   /alias bb1 item 3%;bc$[rand(1,10)] %*
    /alias bc1 item 4%;bd$[rand(1,9)] %*
     /alias bc1 item 5%;bd$[rand(1,8)] %*
      /alias bd1 item 6%;be$[rand(1,7)] %*
       /alias be1 item 7%;bf$[rand(1,6)] %*
        /alias b1 item 8%;bb$[rand(1,5)] %*
         /alias bb1 item 9%;bc$[rand(1,4)] %*
          /alias bb1 item 10%;bc$[rand(1,3)] %*
           /alias bc1 item 11%;bd$[rand(1,2)] %*
               /alias bd1 item 12%;item 13
               /alias bd2 item 13%;item 12
           /alias bc1 item 12%;bd$[rand(1,2)] %*
               /alias bd1 item 11%;item 13
               /alias bd2 item 13%;item 11
           /alias bc1 item 13%;bd$[rand(1,2)] %*
               /alias bd1 item 11%;item 12
               /alias bd2 item 12%;item 11
          /alias bb1 item 11%;bc$[rand(1,3)] %*
.......
 /alias a2 item 1%;b$[rand(1,12)] %*
.......
And it just goes on and on and on....NOT pretty... (i know the alias'
are screwed up it was easier to copy and paste and change the items then
worry later about the alias names)
Help? :-(

Try as i might i can't seem to get this to work, despite loading
complete.tf.
I type in part of a phrase, then try completing it with one of the ESC
key combo's, and nothing happens. I also find having to type ESC i, or
ESC TAB to be silly, is there a way to fix it so all i have to type is
TAB!?

thanks for any help..
John

You may have a list of worlds which should have the more on
e.g.
/set more_worlds =world1 world2 world3

and then define a world hook
that checks if the world is contained in the variable and switches more
on/off respectively

/def -hWORLD h_world_more = \
	/more $[(more_worlds =/ strcat("*{",{*},"}*"))?"on":"off"]


This is not tested :)

Have fun

The simplest thing would be to take the items as parameters to an macro
and to use the index to get one of these.
This only works if your items don't contain spaces. If they do you may
convert them to underscores "_" first and convert them back to spaces
afterwards.

But now example:
/def chooser = \
        /if (!{#}) /return%;/endif%;\
        /let index=$[rand({#})+1]%;\
	/eval \$[replace("_"," ",{%index})]%;\
        /eval /chooser \%-L$[{#}-index+1] \%-%index%; \

;/chooser 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
or
;/chooser item_1 item_2 item_3

Hope it helps

If complete does load correctly perhaps the esc keybinding doesn't work
with your terminal?

You may try to use
; binding to tab
/def -b"^i" b_completion = \
	/if (moresize()>0) /dokey PAGE%; \
	/else /complete%; /endif%;

I have tried and tried but it looks like their is a bug in the code :(
in socket.c nactive


this works
/test test := $[nactive()]

but
/test test := $[nactive(my_world)]
does not



Help on: functions: nactive()
  nactive()
          (int) Number of active worlds (ie, worlds with unseen text).
  nactive(s)
          (int) Number of unseen lines in world <s>.
          Note: when nactive() (with or without arguments) is called from a
          trigger, the line that caused the trigger is not counted by
          nactive() because it has not yet been fully processed (for
	  example, a lower priority trigger might gag the line).

By default, TAB is bound to do the paging from the [More] prompt.  I use
the following to get both, depending on context:

/load complete.tf

/unbind ^i

/def -i -b'^i' tab_bind = \
   /if (moresize()) /dokey page%; \
   /else /complete user_defined%; \
   /endif

The question isn't 100% clear... if you don't run multiple worlds at once,
and just want to have a different setting depending on the world you're in,
just set /more on or off in the settings file for that world.

If you run multiple worlds at once, you're stuck... if you have the
resources, try running multiple TFs in one screen session, this gives a lot
better control over things like this.

is my_world a variable containing the world name ?
nactive("my_world")
btw. don't mix /test and substitution except when you know what your'e
doing.
either:
/set test=$[nactive()]
or
/test test:=nactive()

the more function uses moresize()

as you can see it only returns one value for lines queued

:( would be nice though

Help on: functions: moresize()
  moresize()
          (int) Number of lines queued at a more prompt.


----------------

  /set status_int_more \
       moresize() == 0 ? "" : \
       moresize() > 9999 ? "MuchMore" : \
       pad("More", 4, moresize(), 4)

I'm trying to write a system of triggers that could really use an array-type variable.  I once saw something like this
on Susan Dittmar's website, which is currently down.  I need to store a list of strings (not just single words in some
cases) and be able to loop through it.

Anyone done this before who wouldn't mind showing me how it's done?
 
Thanks in advance,
Chris Hilts

I've thought about this some more over lunch.
I don't know how easily doable this is, but maybe Ken can put this on a wishlist of functionality.  Ever been to
LambdaMOO?  They have a list datatype there.
 
somelist={item1,item2,item3}

You can then refer to them as somelist[1], somelist[2], etc.
 
You can also have lists of lists.

fancylist={{list1-item1,list1-item2},{list2-item1,list2-item2}}

And refer to them the same way.  fancylist[1][1], fancylist[2][1]

Anyway, they're VERY handy on MOOs.  Anyone know of a way to do something like this in tf code?

Subject: Re: virtual array functions

You don't need eval for this:

/def get_array = /return %1%2
/def put_array = /if ({#}>2) /set %1%2=%-3%; /else /unset %1%2%; /endif
/def purge_array = /quote -S /unset `/listvar -s %1*
/def list_array = /listvar %1*

I recommend marking the array variables as special like this: otherwise
you could confuse it with other variables named similiar.

/def get_array = /return _%1_array_%2
/def put_array = /if ({#}>2) /set _%1_array_%2=%-3%; \
	/else /unset _%1_array_%2%; /endif
/def purge_array = /quote -S /unset `/listvar -s _%1_array_*
/def list_array = /listvar _%1_array_*

If you use text not containing other characters than letters,numbers and _
you may also use this as an simple key-value hash list
e.g. /set_array weapon s1 sword_with_a_very_long_id

/def wield = /get_array weapon %1%;wield %?

usage:
instead of: wield sword_with_a_very_long_id
just use: /wield s1

You may store anything to be abbreviated in these lists, e.g. weapons,
friends, npcs, scores etc

Hope it helps

Ah, if you want doubly indexed arrays, how about N indices, or even
named indices (think of it like structures or perl hash's, etc).

Unfortunately, I haven't worked on this in a long time, and isn't even
my main db setup currently, so I haven't written useful things like
functions to tell you how many elements in the array or list of all
array names.  Although those probably turn into relatively simple
functions built on top of a /listvar.

There are also 2 levels of support in here, the N-dimensional actual
array parts are currently all "world local", in that they automatically
are different arrays in different worlds.  I probably should have removed
that, and let the programmer set the worldname as an extra field if they
actually wanted that.  But it was for a hearts card playing bot in tf,
and I cared about world specific arrays.

So the db_* are more basic functions, and the *_info are higher level.
But as I said the *_info currently store data on a world-specific way.

/test set_info("Player Stats", "Miyu", "Mana", 1739)
/test set_info("Player Stats", "Miyu", "Str", 14)
/test set_info("Player Stats", "Hawkeye", "Horse Name", "Moly")

/echo $[get_info("Player Stats", "Miyu", "Mana")
1739

etc

Or for arrays, just use numbers as an index:
/test set_info("Array X", "Cnt", 3)
/test set_info("Array X", 1, "value 1")
/test set_info("Array X", 2, "value 2")
/test set_info("Array X", 3, "value 3")

Note you can obviously mix arrays with structs and vice-versa.

Here's an array package I found somewhere, it was either Susan's site, or, 
David Moore's.

I couldn't tell you how to use it, though. :)

;They are a little easier to do in tf4.0 taking advantage of the new

;
;Here is a quicky package I wrote the other night to do simple db like
;operations.  Not really documented, cope.
;
;The set_info and get_info functions are the easiest to use as
;structure/arrays, but require tf4.0.  They are currently set to be world
;specific (ie, array named `foo' on world X is different than array named
;`foo' on world Y), but you can probably see how to easily change that.
;
;The other functions allow you to do things like define "variables" that
;are world specific or global, or world specific but have a default
;value, etc.
;
;To do array/structure things you can do:
;
;/def set_age =\
;    /let who=%{1}%;\
;    /let age=%{2}%;\
;    /test set_info("PLAYER", who, "AGE", age)
;
;/def get_age =\
;    /let who=%{1}%;\
;    /echo $[get_info("PLAYER", who, "AGE")
;
;For arrays just use a number instead of a string like "AGE".  For
;example, it's really easy to make things like a linked list package on
;top of these routines.

Greetings,

I have a few /def's that highlight certain combat messages to color
depending on the type of message.  For example, if i miss a skill it
will show up white, if the skill connects it will show up blue.  The
only problem is that the mud sends it own color codes and it's as if
tf's attribute option blends with the incoming colors.  If the line
comes in as yellow and I set the attribute to bright white, the line
will appear on my screen as bright yellow.

Is there a way to strip the color of the incoming text before my custom
color is applied?

Thanks in advance for any help.

 From "/help attributes":

"  Normally, new attributes are combined with the pre-existing 
attributes.  But
   if the new attributes include "x" (exclusive), the pre-existing display
   attributes are turned off first.  So, for example, if one trigger with -au
   and another trigger with -Pr match the same line, the whole line will be
   underlined and part of it will also be reversed; but if the second trigger
   had -Pxr instead, then most of the line would be underlined, and part would
   be reversed but not underlined."

Conclusion:

Lets say your "skill miss" trigger looks like this:

    /def -aCwhite -mglob -t"You miss*" SkillMissed

Just add an "x" to the attributes:

    /def -axCwhite -mglob -t"You miss*" SkillMissed

That _should_ work (I didn't test it)

Hoped it helped.

for example /def -F -mregexp -t'This is some text' test = /echo it worked

How can I make this match "this is some text" or "ThiS iS soMe TeXT"

Thanks

regexp trigger are always case sensitive use glob triggers for not
sensitive ones:
/def -F -mglob -t"*This is some text*" test = /echo it worked

just curious is there a way to align text in TF?
I have a chart of stuff that i am trying to keep track of in a MUD.
Such as exp gain, kills, quests, quest points and gold gotten from
quests.
what I would like is
         Since Reboot  Since Added
EXP      
KILLS    
QUESTS   
POINTS   
GOLD     

The 1st problem that I have is that i have the #'s aligned under each S
in Since, once the # under Since Reboot hits double digits it moves the
Since Added # to under the I and triple goes under the N and so on
Is there a way to have a field or something that is like say 11 char's
wide and wont move the other 2nd column?  Even if I have to align it so
that it is under the T in reboot and last d in added. (don't care about
that)
The other thing is, how am i able to store these #'s?  Of course when I
restart TF due to a reboot or something the data that I have up until
then is wiped out, pretty much making the Since Added section useless.
My #'s are:
$[exp], $[kills], $[exp/kills], $[qp], $[gp], $[quests], $[qp/quests],
$[gp/quests]
I think i know how i would write them to a file and put /set XXX=$[XXX]
in there and then just load it up when i need it.  But the way that I
know will just append it to the file.  I want to just get rid of the OLD
info and put in the new info.
I assume that it has something to do with this part of /help tfio:
tfopen(): The tfopen(name, mode) function can be used to open arbitrary
streams.  If called with no arguments, tfopen() opens an unnamed "q"
mode stream.  The <mode> argument describes the usage of the stream:
"w"     Open a file "<name>" for writing.  Write operations will
overwrite existing file contents, if any.
but i tried this once before with something else and it just never
worked.
Any help?

Thanks,
Jason

Hi all.

I am using TF on MUSHES and for pk muds, where speed is essential, I use
powwow. The main reason of using powwow is its 'terminal speed'.

In Tinyfugue I feel the prompt, from where I press w(to go west) and
until I am presented with the prompt again(the cursor jumps to output
window then back to input again) is way to slow and it feels jumpy.=20

Is there any way to speed up cursor movement in TF? I belive using
separate input and output areas is great but the slow blinking of the
cursor moving up and down between the different areas and when
representing the prompt after a cmomand is not very fun.

Any advice are appreciated.

Add line

/visual off

in your .tfrc file. This is the way how I always used TF. I play pk muds
too.

Hmm you could define a prompt hook, that sets the prompt everytime a
prompt is received from the mud.

/def -hPROMPT h_custom_prompt = /test prompt("Anand    : ")

Hi, I've used another mud client and I've such a problem with tf...

I don't know how to test trigger without connecting to mud...
Maybe there is a way to add some text to socket... or force tf to
check all defs?
I need something like
/test_all_defs_with_this_string blah blah blah

Any help?

/help trigger

Also if the echo port is enabled on your machine you
can do a /world localhost 7
which will echo back whatever you type into it.

I am trying to /gag some output from a MUD so that i only see stuff that
is from my clan.
But for some reason the gags aren't working:

/gag *INFO: The pirates plunder nearby villages to celebrate * reaching
level *
/gag *INFO: * is at work close by, better watch your back.*
/gag *INFO: * raises a level. Now up to level *
/gag *INFO: Blood drips from *'s weapon as they turn their gaze towards
you.*
/gag *INFO: Oghma's touch enlightens * upon reaching level *

but yet THESE gags work perfectly fine:
/gag *tells you 'threats against *! This threat must be eliminated!'*
/gag *tells you 'Since the escape, * has murdered '*
/gag *tells you '* civilians! The penalty for this crime is death, and'*
/gag *tells you 'you are to deliver the sentence!'*
/gag *tells you 'has escaped from the dungeon!'*

so i know it's not that i have /nogag on

??..

I have lines contaning for example

	*an Elf* closes the door.

and have a trigger looking like=20

/def -mregexp -ag -t'^(.*) closes the (.*).$' doorclosed3 =3D /set
doorname %P2%;/echo -p @{Cred}@{B}%P1 closes the @{Cyellow}%P2 @{Cred}.=20
Tf tells me (.*) is very inefficient and I shouldnt use it. I have tried
using ([^ ]+) but it does not trigger on that because of the  space
between the "an" and "Elf". Is there any other way to make that trigger
better? I can have the following situations and would like some advice
on them(with gagging and redisplay doorname with color:

*an Elf* closes the door. 	(usually)
*>*an Elf* closes the door.	(When its spammy it come just after prompt)
Someone narrates '*an Elf* closes the door.' (someone narrates it)


Fyi,  I play on MUME <mume.org 23>, and wonder if anyone else on the
list do that and have suggestions, tips or macron you like to share.

Any idead and suggestions are appreciated.

If the asterisks are always there, you could perhaps use:

   \*([^*]+)\* closes the ([^.]+)\.

You might have triggers on the same text. Gag have
priority 0 so every triger could overwrite it. If
you want your gags to work either make the triggers
fall-thru (with -F flag) or define gags with higher 
priority using def.
eg. /def -p10 -ag -t"*tells you 'has escaped from the dungeon!'*"

I use netcat to do the testing. It is like a stupid server which just 
listens to a port and which you can connect to.

Then everything you type in the nc window goes directly to tf and you can 
test your triggers like on the real mud.

I am not sure where to find the sources on the net but I'm sure you can 
find it easily when you look for "netcat". The version I use is 1.10. :-)

Hope I could help.

Harry.

I know the current TF is not very portable, only portable to windows 
because of CYGWIN.

But is the new TF 5.0 going to be portable so all you have to do is 
recompile it for a different OS.

4.0 is /very/ portable... it runs successfully on all sorts of /decent/ 
operaating systems ;)

I really dont see the problem of being forced to use cygwin, either.

The current TF is not very portable anymore with the latest CYGWIN.

Someone on this list can't get it to compile.

Take mame for example, that VERY portable, I think it has been ported to 
windows,
Linux, and a few other os's that's just by recompiling and making some 
changes.

I have a handy little macro that controls flying a
transport around simulated map space.

It gives me this message every time it hits the first
"match" (ss_fly_match)

% ss_fly_match: unexpected /ELSEIF in outer block

As far as I can tell, the if-else part is configured
correctly. Any suggestions?

I don't think so, at least if your indentation shows your intent.
All of those extra nested macro lines need to end with %%;
The %; is a line separator, and it's for the outermost macro,
so it thinks you have a spurious /elseif in the outermost macro.


Like this:

/set FLYSET=stop
/def -qFp50 -w'ss' -t'Loc: F* * *E Heading: *' ss_fly_match = \
     /send heading 24 %;\
     /send speed 10 %;\
     /def -qFp54 -n1 -w'ss' -t'Loc: F* * *E Heading: *' ss_fly_match2 = \
          /send heading 0 %;\
     /def -qp52 -n1 -w'ss' -t'Loc: F* * *E Heading: *' ss_fly_match3 = \
          /send speed 26 %;\
     /def -F -w'ss' -p10 -t'*You see no traces of a paintmark.' ss_fly_notrace = \
          /if ({FLYSET}=~"add") \
               /send add location here=LZ needed $[ftime("%m/%d/%Y", time())] %%;\

hi
I would like to create a time based trig that inputs a

the command?

Any help apreciated.

AHHHHHH...

Thanks. I'd read a bit about using two percent signs in the past, but, 
didn't really understand where they applied. I do now. Thanks for the 
explanation :).

How do I escape a semi-colon in /send text so that it's 'sent' to the game 
and not evaluated by tf?

Do you mean percent-sign?  tf doesn't do anything special with semi-colons.
To send the % (from inside a macro, where it's special) either stick
another % on front, or a \.

Is there a way to make an idler (that sends something random to the
connected world) at random times?  Perhaps even random things sent, like
various commands?

/def foo = \
  /nth $[rand(1,3)] twiddle yawn burp %; \
  /repeat -$[rand(60,180)] 1 /foo

adjust the random ranges and the list of commands to your liking.

I wanted to make a respeller for when my spells run out so as not to
waste time casting those that I already have.
I tried it this way, but it wont work.  All that happens is that the
trigger gets activated and will cast the spell rather than store it for
when i call it up.
I am sure that its the %; but I dont know how to set it up..I also did
%%; and /set respellup SHOWS respellup=affects%;c 'prayer of fortune'
if i /trigger Your prayer of fortune weakens.
BUT when i type /respellups the MUD throwns me an error. as if TF's
sending the %; as part of the command rather than seperating it :-(

/def respellups=%{respellup}
/set respellup=affects
/def -mregexp -t'^Your prayer of fortune weakens.' pof=/set
respellup=%{respellup}%;c 'prayer of fortune'
/def -mregexp -t'^You feel yourself slow down.' haste=/set
respellup=%{respellup}%;c haste

(VERY short list of other spells)
Your magical armor wears away.
You feel less righteous as the blessing upon you fades.
Your rage ebbs.
You feel yourself slow down.
The magic circle around you shimmers and fades away.

Any ideas?  Anyone know of good online sources for TF codes as well?...i
have a few book marked but can't really find much...

Thanks,
Jason

You have a couple of lines that may just have been word-wrapped on you,
but...

/DEF -mregexp -t'^Your prayer of fortune weakens.' pof = \
/SET respellup=%{respellup} %; /SEND c 'prayer of fortune'

You will notice that at the end of the first line I have a \ which
continues the command to the next line.  Thats the only thing which stands
out to me.  good luck

Nope, what yours does is the exact same thing that mine does...recasts
the spell right then and there like i said it does...
what I need is something that STORES it so that down the line i can type
/respellups and get those that left me back on me...

On a MUSH that tends to get spammy I got myself the idea: What if I could
filter out the channels and redirect them elsewhere?

/def -ag -wMUSH -mregexp -t"^\[Public\]" forwardpub= /echo -wPUBLIC %P0%PR

It all sounded like a nice enough idea until I tried to figure out how to
define an 'unconnected world'. I don't need a world as such, just a buffer
that TF thinks is a world. Essentially an:

/addummyworld

I think it could work nicely in combination with world-q.tf or
whater'ver one prefers. Anyone know how to accomplish this? Or perhaps
another way to get the same result?

Well the hackish work-around way would be to make a connection to the
loopback port (7) on localhost, but most modern UNIX installs disablethis for security reasons.  Similarly, you could connect to the discard
port (9) but if 7 doesn't work, 9 won't likely either.  Basically, tobe useful the world has to be connected somewhere.  So the trick is
finding somewhere to connect to that will not do anything and notdisconnect you.

/addworld PUBLIC localhost echo

But it doesn't even have to be connected for you to be able to echo
into it and work with it.  But to be able to switch through them
as separate worlds you will have to connect to something.  If you have
an echo port on, use that, or you can even just connect to your favorite
web port until the server decides to boot you off.

Imho tf does not handle unconnected worlds

I solved the problem by writing the data to files (pipes don't work)

/def -ag -wMUSH -mregexp -t"^\[Public\]" forwardpub =3D \
=09/test fwrite("public.log",strcat("PUBLIC ",{P0},{PR}))

and using
xterm -e tail -f public.loc
to show the data

Hope it helps

Hi All,

Well, I know this is bad and really lame. But....

I've been using tf on and off for quite a few years, but never got my 
head around the programming side. But anyway, I only ever use tf 
for playing ack muds, and occasionally to log into a backgammon 
server.

But my two questions are :

1) I haven't been able to work it out at any stage or manage to find 
it in hte help files and I know it is in there, just hiding. I'm after a 
way to change to characters :
(i) the / for the commands. I actually run alias.tf, so for any aliases 
I run. I don't have to type /blah all the time, and just type blah. But / 
tends to be used as a short cut for the word recall on an ack mud, 
and every so often when I use tf I forget so I have to type // for 
recall instead. Is there a way to change the command char from / 
to # or something similar ?
(ii) What is the command separator character ? I assume it's semi 
colon, ; , cos that is used in any aliases you create through /def, 
etc, but most of my spell aliases are like /alias sp c armor%;c 
bless%;  etc. But when I'm not using aliases, sometimes I want to 
type a few commands into the same command line at once, but I 
can't yet again due to playing ack muds, where ; is used as a short 
cut for gtell, which is group-tell.

Unfortunately on a mud there is no way to change the defined / and 
; keys, is there a way to change the command and separator keys 
to things like # and | ?

The other thing I was going to query was, I went through the help 
on prompt, and it goes on about capturing your prompt with the 
following line, depending of course on your prompt :

/def -h"PROMPT *> " catch_prompt = /test prompt({*})

Now I don't know what I'm doing wrong or what I should be enetring 
at the command line to run the prompt capture trigger, or if I have 
to run anything. The prompt I generally tend to use ends in the mud 
time of hr pm or hr am. Just as an example :

<14332/14332hp 8276/8276mn> 1476xp Warrior 8 pm

If I need a carriage return or forced line break after that as well I 
don't know.

Anyway, any help is more than appreicated.

Signed,

I,m a lame too, but:
 - Command separator for aliases, defs and other is consist of two chars: %;
 - When I asked about command separator for command line, friend said: there
isn't commend separator in command line.
   I play lpmuds, so I have create many aliases and defs and now I don't
need use more than one command in command line.

Command-separator acceptance is controlled by the setting of %{sub}.
(See also /sub command).  You _might_ want to change that.

A very handy key-binding, from Ken Keys, is one which means that _if_
you press ESCAPE-RETURN instead of RETURN, then all substitution,
including %; substitution, is enabled for the current line:

 /def -b'^[^M' =3D /sub full%;/dokey newline%;/sub off

It's actually possible to have some kind of a command separator in a command
line, I'm using a script written by  Andrew C.M. McClintock and corrected by
Ken Keys, works perfectly for me. When you have a script loaded "]" is
informing tf you're going to work with that "command separator", now "] say
s, say o" will send "say s" and "say o" rite after, like in alias.

I'm placing whole the file below as I'm not sure how the mailing list is
handling with atachments. Here we go:

;;;;;;; CUT HERE ;;;;;;

;;; Original by Andrew C.M. McClintock <andrewm@tiger.hsc.edu>
;;; corrections by Ken Keys <hawkeye@commercewave.com>

; Here is some tf code i wrote to handle mutliple commands inputted at once,
; using the comma as a delimiter, and the ] and > keys as the commands
; trigger:

/alias ] /do_expand %{*}

/alias > /eval /do_expand %%{dir_%{1}}%;\
    /if (strlen({-1})) /do_expand %{-1} %; /endif

/def do_expand = \
    /let args=%*%; \
    /let i=0%; \
    /while ((i:=strchr(args, ",")) >= 0) \
        /eval $[substr(args, 0, i)]%; \
        /let args=$[substr(args, i+1)]%; \
    /done%; \
    /eval %args

; so usage would be:
;
; ] s,kill dog,laugh dog,moon dog

; like:
;
; /set dir_temple s,e,n,w

;

;
; also you can use the move macros bundled with commands at the end:

That's correct - the comment line must *start* with a ; (semicolon) character.

Urgh, there _must_ be other way to do it (commenting this way makes the
code even more hard to read). If this really is the case and there's no
other possibilites I'd suggest commenting to be improved to next version.
It's spam to write a whole own line for each comment.

the only thing you can do right now is the following:

define a commenting macro

/def ; = /test 0

and use it in your code

/def test = /echo Test1%;		/; This is a Test %;\
	/echo Test2%;			/; This is another Test %;\
	/echo Test3

Hope it helps

Michael

Like in sh, you can use :, which also happens to be defined in tf-lib.

/def foo =\
    /echo hello%;/: This will be ignored%;\
    /echo bar

It's not super pretty, but the other nice feature is that they remain
when you /list.

   I'm using this program but with vim only comes a syntax highlightning
file of tf. Does anyone know if someone has built up an indent file of
tf for vim? Again it would help a lot when trying to make make the
outlook of code more easily readable.
