I have a question on uparrow vs ctrl-p behavior.  I used to play from a shell
account on a Sun unix box.  Since (sadly) that box got decommissioned, I play
from my linux box at home.  On both machines I use Putty to ssh in to run tf
from shell.  On the Sun box when I hit uparrow to recall input history, it put the
cursor at the beginning of the line, and with ctrl-p it would put it at the end of
the line.  I found this extremely handy.  On my linux box, both uparrow and
ctrl-p put the cursor at the end of the line.  Is there a setting or something that
could be different between the 2 tf installs that would cause this changed behavior?

My linux box has tf 5.0b8, the Sun box had prolly somewhere around 5.0b4.

As always, any help is muchly appreciated.

I'm trying to work out a way to "name" all 256 RGB colors (+ grayscale)

I found a config doc that put them in formats like this:

hi x016_Grey0 ctermfg=16 guifg=#000000
hi x017_NavyBlue ctermfg=17 guifg=#00005f
hi x018_DarkBlue ctermfg=18 guifg=#000087
hi x019_Blue3 ctermfg=19 guifg=#0000af
hi x020_Blue3 ctermfg=20 guifg=#0000d7
hi x021_Blue1 ctermfg=21 guifg=#0000ff
hi x022_DarkGreen ctermfg=22 guifg=#005f00

I had thought that the "x016" and so on was equivalent to the rgb
values of the 6x6x6 cube used in Tinyfugue. That turned out to be
wrong.

Is  there a list of color "names" anywhere that matches up with the
rgb codes Tinyfugue uses (which appear to go from 000 to 555)? The
color values I have start at 016 and go to 255.

I've googled for info on the 6x6x6 color cube but I can't find
anything else that seems to use the same numbers as Tinyfugue.

My auto-sipper still isn't working but I had sent a slightly wrong
version of code to the list.

I'm taking a break from that to get back to my crystal mining macro
set. Someone has asked for a new feature :).

The crystals we mine can be cut in different sizes and shapes and we
have a marketing department that sets the values of those sizes and
shapes. That way, if we end up with a glut of "Small" crystals or
"pyramids", the prices on those will go down and the prices on others
will go up.

There's also a category called "grouping" based on musical chords
(octave, five chord, four chord, etc), but it has a fixed value of
scale and octave is always "best" for a miner to cut.

The market report looks like this:

==============================================================================
      Crystal Market values ( shown in order of most valuable to least
)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
color:
  black, white, yellow, blue, amethyst, green, and rose

shape:
  octagon, cylinder, prism, cone, rectangle, pentagon, dodecahedron,
and pyramid

 size:
  very large, large, medium large, medium, medium small, very small,
small, and tiny

                 Data last updated:  Tue Jan  4 09:57:03 2011
==============================================================================

The values are from left to right, so "black" crystal, "octagon"
shapes, and "very large" crystals are each the most valuable for their
category. We have no control over color, but we can control what size
and shape we cut at a time.

I grab these in global variables:

/set MARKET_COLOR1=black
/set MARKET_COLOR2=white
/set MARKET_COLOR3=yellow
/set MARKET_COLOR4=blue
/set MARKET_COLOR5=amethyst
/set MARKET_COLOR6=green
/set MARKET_COLOR7=rose
/set MARKET_SHAPE1=octagon
/set MARKET_SHAPE2=cylinder
/set MARKET_SHAPE3=prism
/set MARKET_SHAPE4=cone
/set MARKET_SHAPE5=rectangle
/set MARKET_SHAPE6=pentagon
/set MARKET_SHAPE7=dodecahedron
/set MARKET_SHAPE8=pyramid
/set MARKET_SIZE1=very large
/set MARKET_SIZE2=large
/set MARKET_SIZE3=medium large
/set MARKET_SIZE4=medium
/set MARKET_SIZE5=medium small
/set MARKET_SIZE6=very small
/set MARKET_SIZE7=small
/set MARKET_SIZE8=tiny

I want to do a command that's something like "/cut market", which
would make a few very simple (hopefully) choices, reflective of
cutting to the market conditions.

So, it would set the CUT_SHAPE to MARKET_SHAPE1, it would always cut
octaves for the grouping, and (the part I need help with), it would go
through the list of sizes and determine which is out of the expected
order. Any crystal size in a more left-most position than it's
expected one is more valuable (any one more to the right is less
valuable).

The expected order is this: very large, large, medium large, medium,
medium small, small, very small, tiny

So, in our present market, "small" and "very small" have switched
places. This makes "very small" more valuable than normal, and "small"
less valuable. What I'm looking for is some logic that can determine
if a size is more valuable than usual.

I'm not sure how it can be done, but I figure it ought to be something
TF macros could handle. Maybe if there was a way to assign numbers
based on position and the expected position and checking if they're
gt/lt/eq?

Anyway, I only have the vaguest idea of _how_ this could be
implemented, and I'm hoping one of the programmers out there could
tell me an efficient and effective way of doing this.

I would do this with the 'lists' macros previously published here.

The technique would be to have a hard-coded list of the 'default' values
and then create a dynamic list based on the market data.

When you want to choose a size to cut, you look up that text in the
dynamic list and get its position. Then look up the text in the static
list and see if one is smaller/larger.

You would end up with 4 lists. 2 for size and 2 for shape.

There are certainly many more ways to tackle the same problem, but since
I use lists extensively, this is the first solution that occurred to me.

I'm a Mac-tard and I don't have access to a Mac to test things.

A friend is running Andy's 4.1 Stable Mac install.

We're having trouble with keybindings and scrollback.

She says she gets the 'UH UH!' noise from her comp when she 'up' or 'down'
arrows. (I guess that's some sort of beep noise).

She also says her buffer scrolls off the screen and the Terminal windows
scroll bar does not work to recover it. Page up/down doesn't seem to be
working, either.

She's running OSX v. 10.4.11

Is there maybe a default set of keybindings I need to point her to for a
Mac?

We did definitely get her libraries loading and her .tfrc set up (using a
cut-down version of mine).

I'm kind of fried, I've been helping her for about 6 hours. I'm sorry if
this doesn't make much sense.

Gwen

The Mac and Key Bindings is really odd.  I've seen this problem a couple of times, but I don't recall the fix.

The page references irssi, but it does the same thing for tf (at least, it works for me on my mac).

I use Tinyfugue on both Windows and assorted Linux installs.

On Windows, I can type /ps and see process information, without any issues
(like so):

  PID     NEXT T D WORLD       PTIME COUNT
COMMAND
  276   57.998 r   ss        0:02:10     1 /cut_loop re fa la

When on _any_ linux install (n900 ARM build, FreeBSD, Fedora 13) if I type
/ps, it crashes Tf. I've mailed the crash reports to Ken, but I suspect he
has bigger fish to fry. I've probably set something wrong, somewhere.

The only reason I want to type /ps is to get the information above (what's
still in the cut_loop queue, and how much time is left till the next loop).
I do so much channel-chatting and background stuff that I often spam my
cut-loop progress right off the screen.

Is there a way to get the same information without typing /ps?

Gwen



PS - technically, FreeBSD is not Linux, it's BSD, but it's a close cousin
;).

I'm having problems with macros triggering on worlds where I mostly
want them to work, but not "always".

Is there a way to define macros to load in all worlds _BUT_ a specific
world name. Something that's basically the opposite of "/def -w"name".

Bonus points would be a way to define the macros for a specific world
type EXCEPT a specific world within that type. Some sort of -T"type"
!-w"name" in the same define.

Also, is there a way to unload all the macros that match a specific
name-prefix (so if for example, I create a bunch of macros that all
start with flying_<name> is there a way to unload all the flying
macros?

Related to my question from yesterday (and thanks for the responses,
they were all helpful)...I think I worked out a fix on my own, working
with my existing configuration.

Somewhere along the line, someone suggested to me that I define my
worlds by type of server and a special suffix, like so:

;; Crystalmush
/addworld -T"tiny.mush.cm"

;;Firefly MUX
/addworld -T"tiny.mux.ff"

;; Realm of Despair MUD
/adddiku -T"diku.rod"

The theory is that if I have two MUXes I play on, any macros defined
as -T"tiny.mux" ought to work on them, but if I have macros specific
to Firefly MUX I can then use -T"tiny.mux.ff"

This is explained more thoroughly in /help /addworld and I don't need
to teach it to the more experienced people here. :)

In the past I never picked up the part where I define my macros to
match by world type. Looking over /help /addworld, it shows me how to
do this more or less granular matching. I think going back and
redefining my macros by world type is the best fix for controlling
whether the macros will bleed over into the wrong worlds. I can just
add a more specific sub-type for worlds that get very particular
macros.

Thanks for the answers, one of the people who responded to my question
said something about using glob matching for undefining macros that
triggered a half-thought about the world type and then I tracked down
the answer in the help files.

Sometimes it's not so much that I don't read the help files, as I'm
just not sure what file to start with!

I recently found out a friend of mine on a MUSH is blind. She uses a
client called VIP MUD which interfaces with her JAWS reading program
to read out the screen data and allow her to continue to MUSH. I was
wondering if Tinyfugue would work with it as well? I have a collection
of macros she would like to use.

She's on Windows, not sure if there's something special needed to get
the Windows version of Tinyfugue working with JAWS.

I have some problems with storing some strings in Galvin's Virtual
Array and then pulling them back out. This relates to matching with
special characters in a regexp match.

Here's the regexp that matches lines pulled from the array:

/def -F -p20 -T"tiny.mush.cm" -mregexp -t'^This claim was built by
([A-Za-z-,& ]+)\.$' claim_builder = \
	/set CLAIM_BUILDER=%P1


Here's one problem entry:
/test put_2array('claim', 073, '2', 'Started by Sasryn, finished by Bayr..')

Note the periods (.) after Bayr. There's actually two periods on this
claim (a typo). I've asked the build staff to fix it but who knows if
they'll ever answer. In the meantime, the match fails. I've tried
putting one period in the single quotes, as well as two. I don't know
what to do to the regexp to match one or two periods. The above regexp
matches fine with one period at the end of the line, which is standard
for the code. Do I just put another plus sign after the \. and before
the dollar sign?

Here's another other problem entry:
/test put_2array('claim', 112, '2', 'Corinna Crosley (Cori)')

Sometimes entries have open/close parenthesis in them. I can't get
them into the regmatch without it breaking.

I'm sure it's just my regexp matching comprehension is too weak, but
any help would be appreciated.

You could try using:

([A-Za-z-,& ]+)(\.|\.\.)$

That will match a period or a double period at the end.

You could try the following for the parenthesis:

([A-Za-z-,& ]+|[A-Za-z-,& ]+\))(\.|\.\.)$

That should match a name with or without the parenthesis

This is just from memory and I haven't tested these, so be careful.

You could change your regexp to this:

"^This claim was built by ([A-Za-z-,&\(\). ]+)$"

That will grab any ( ) . as well as your letters, , & and - and put them to %{P1}

Hey gang I just recently switched over to tf-50b8 and
I notice that while mudding.  That I can get the backspace key to
backspace so I have to be careful to type everything correctly.

Is this a problem anyone else is having?

Good Day tinyfugue users and developers!

I was wondering if someone can explain to me how I can toggle a trigger on/off.

my trigger:
 /trig You get * gold sovereigns from a canvas backpack. = put
sovereigns in backpack342378


Is there a way I could make this trigger toggleable?

I have triggers like this:

/def -mregexp -t"You have successfully gathered some \w+" mine_again = /if
(amine) mine%;/endif

Then when I want it on, I do:

/set amine 1

And when I want it off I do:

/unset amine,
or
/set amine 0

I then have a def like this:

/def amine = \
/if (amine != 1) /set amine 1%;/cyanecho *****Auto Mining*****%;\
/else /set amine 0%;/redecho *****Not Auto Mining*****%;/endif

That way whenever I type /amine, I toggle it on or off.

Add a name to your trigger so you can refer to it later, eg.
/def -mglob -t'You get * gold...' get_gold = put ...

After that you can refer to the trigger with the name (get_gold).
You can either undefine it (/undef get_gold) and then later create
it again if you wish, or alternatively you can set the chance of the 
trigger firing to 0 or 100 (/edit -c0 get_gold or /edit -c100 get_gold).

I understand although /help def only shows the bottom half of the help
topic and for some reason I can't scroll back up inside of tf.

This is what I have now:
/set goldv 1
/def gold =3D \
 /if (goldv !=3D 1) /set goldv 1 %; /cyanecho ***Gold Reflex On*** %; \
 /else /set goldv 0 %; /redecho ***Gold Reflex Off*** %; /endif

/def -E{goldv} -t 'You get * gold sovereigns from a canvas backpack.'
goldvtrig =3D put sovereigns in backpack342378

And this is the error message I get:
% triggers, line 11: DEF: illegal macro name "'You get * gold
sovereigns from a canvas backpack.' goldvtrig".

Why is that?

Try this line:

/def -mregexp -t"You get * gold sovereigns from a canvas backpack\.'
goldvtrig = /if(goldv) put sovereigns in backpack342378


Also, you can remove the /cyanecho and /redecho bits and just use /echo,
those were macros I have to change the color of what I echo.


The -mregexp stands for "matching regular expression". I always use these
instead of '/trig' since I'm usually capturing bits and pieces and using it.

My setup:
Linux 2.6.37.2, KDE 4.6.4, Konsole 2.6.4, Screen version 4.01.00devel,
TinyFugue 5.0 beta 8.

Since I run tf inside screen, my TERM special global variable is set
to "screen".

Thanks to everyone I got it to work like this:

/set goldv 1
/def gold = \
 /if (goldv != 1) /set goldv 1 %; /echo ***Gold Reflex On*** %; \
 /else /set goldv 0 %; /echo ***Gold Reflex Off*** %; /endif

/def -E{goldv} -t'You get * gold sovereigns from a canvas backpack.'
goldvtrig = \

Thanks again for everyone's support

I understand although /help def only shows the bottom half of the help
topic and for some reason I can't scroll back up inside of tf.

The easiest way, I have found, is to simply issue the command "/more on" th=
at way the help screens will show a screen at a time.=A0 If you hit tab it =
will advance.=A0 To turn it off use "/more off" and it will jump to the end=
 of the text and turn off.

Greetings tinyfugue users & developers!

I remember that the old tf had a delay option and
after downloading and reading the manual for the beta release.

It seems to have not be included or is no longer an option.
My question is how do we now have timed delayed triggers.


my trigger:
 /def -E{scalemailv} -t"You remove a suit of scale mail."
scalemaivtrig = \ wear scalemail

I was trying to add a 2.5 second delay before this trigger fires is
this possible at all.

Thanks in advance, Patrick

I don't recall this (which isn't disagreement, I just don't recall 
it).

I'd just use /repeat:

/def -E{scalemailv} -t"You remove a suit of scale mail." scalemaivtrig = /repeat -w -2.5 1 /send \ wear scalemail

This is a way to go, but in my opinion a special interface to the
screenreader is not necessary.

Beeing blind myself, I'm using Tf for years. Nowadays I run TF in a
Gnome-Terminal and Orca, a screenreader for the graphical Unix/Linux
desktop, announces incoming Mud text automatically. Of course it is also
possible to read text again manually which has already been spoken.

One important thing is to turn off visual mode as screenreaders get
confused by the separate input area.

Some years ago I used TF also on Windows, together with the Jaws
screenreader, which worked fine as well, with visual mode beeing turned
off.

cheers

Good evening users and developers,

I was wondering if there was a part of text in game for later use.
 (Party): <person> says, "Target <target>"
(Party): <person> says, "Shoot <target> <direction>"

my questions was how do you capture the <target> or the <direction>
part to store in a variable for later scripting.

Thanks in advance.

It's been a loonng time since I've done any major scripting but something a=

/def -mregexp -t"\(Party\)\: [a-zA-Z]* says. \"Target *\"" saytarget=3D set=
 target=3D%P2

It may work, or it may not.=A0 I'm not sure.=A0=A0 But you will use somethi=

Hello Patrick,

Here's my solutions:

To capture the line: (Party): <person> says, "Target <target>"
/def -mregexp -t"\(Party\): .* says, \"Target (.*)\"" a =3D \
  /set target %P1

For the line: (Party): <person> says, "Shoot <target> <direction>"
/def -mregexp -t"\(Party\): .* says, \"Shoot (.*) (.*)\"" a =3D \
  /set target %P1 %;\
  /set direction %P2

Use /echo instead of /set when developing to see what you're capturing.

You can read more help on this particular special variable from "/help Pn".

I would clean this up slightly to prevent improper matches. First, =

since you're using regexp, you'll want to anchor using ^ and $. Then, =

you'll want to either make your wildcards more specific, or make them =

non-greedy. For a non-specific (.*) wildcard to be non-greedy, you'd =

make it a .*? with the question mark.

Basically, if you would see the line:
(NotPartyChan): Johnny says, "I saw someone else say (Party): Mary =

says, "Target charlie"

that would match the given trigger because of the missing anchors. =

Also, if you saw (Party): Johnny says, "Target says something Target "

You could end up with the first %P1 meaning <Johnny says, "Target>.

If you don't use pretitles or other characters in player names, so that =

all the <person> references are single words, then you can be really =

specific to

/def -mregexp -t"^\(Party\): [a-zA-Z]+ says, \"Target ([a-zA-Z]+)\"$" a =3D=
 \
/set target %P1

Or a bit less specific with

/def -mregexp -t"^\(Party\): .*? says, \"Target (.*)\"$" a =3D \
/set target %P1

Hope this helps,
Mike

Thank you so much for the answer, and I'm sure my friend will thank you as =
well.

She tried Tinyfugue but told me Jaws kept "beeping" at her. I'll tell
her to turn off visual mode and find out if that works.

Yeah, Mike that helped alot. Would something like the anchors help it
to be greedy in the sense if characters had both pre and post titles
on there name.

my problem at the moment and I been playing with this for 3 days now.
is capturing such titles.

/def -mregexp -t"In your mind's eye, you see (.*) crushed by your
meteor." reportarc1 = \
 /send clt %{target} hit with meteor %; /send partytell %{target} hit
with meteor


this works well with just pre titles only or just post titles only but
if they have both it does work at all.
example title for character Salik: Chevalier Salik Rian, Protege of
Lady Ferrous.
these type of character names it's not matching.  Also normally the
trigger text is on one line but with such long titles it spans two
lines.

I have found that the best way to approach this sort of problem is in
stages.

Let the primary trigger capture 'pre-name', 'name', 'post name' as a
single string. Then pass that to another macro for further processing.

Think of the problem in terms of how you as a human identify the name of
the person. There is probably a limited list of 'titles' that a
character can have. This can be matched with

(title1|title2|title3)

type pattern. In your single sample, I see a comma after the name. So
now you have their name between the 'title' and the comma. If they do
not have a 'post title', then how does that get displayed?

You can also have your scripts 'remember' people and develop your own
lists that can be used to filter the results you get from your macros.

These are just some ideas. You have not really given us much of a sample
set to try and get closer to the patterns you will need to match.

Don't worry about the quantity of macros etc. My .tf files run to over
7500 lines of triggers, aliases etc etc. I also have a bot on-line that
is self sufficient and remembers objects handed to him for casting
spells on. If he gets a unknown item, then he asks for the keyword and
adds it to his inventory list. Currently he remembers over 1800 items in
memory without using an external database. TF just keeps on running and
I cannot see any delays when I use the interactive mode on the bot.

if the don't have a post title.
with just post title:  Chevalier Salik Rian
and some character don't even have a last name like: Salik

It seems TF is alot more able to more complex things than I imagine.

Hey good day tinyfugue users and developers.
I'm still having trouble with this trigger at the moment. It works for
people with short names but long names it doesn't fire for those.
my trigger:

/def -mregexp -t"^In your mind's eye, you see (.*) crushed by your
meteor.$" reportarc1 = \
 /send clt %{target} hit with meteor %; /send partytell %{target} hit
with meteor

This is what I see with long names the below text spans two lines
in game and with short names it's all on one line.

In your mind's eye, you see Kohai Denex Le'Dominae, Ashuran Tiger
crushed by your meteor.

It fires perfectly with people who have short names. like below.
In your mind's eye, you see Mycen crushed by your meteor.

Basically I wanting it to be greedy and to fire regardless of how long
the name is. Since it only shows me that text when I firing arrows at
other character.

Is there a way I do that?

Regards, Patrick

When the text spans two lines, is the MUD sending that as two lines?

Because if it is, that's almost certainly why it doesn't work.  AFAIK,
tinyfugue cannot span multiple lines with regexp.

But if that's just the normal line wrap...  it should be working exactly as
it is.

Yes, what is almost undoubtedly happening is your MUD is hard wrapping it
into multiple lines.

In many MUDs this can be disabled, if so, do so. There is a bit of an
annoying manner to make this work if not, as in this instance the end of the
text is consistent.

Set up a trigger to match just the end of the text  You can use /recall -w
to get the line sent prior. With that, patch the two together in a variable
to have the whole string and run regmatch() on it. It is a far from simple
approach.


Best of luck,

When the text spans two lines, is the MUD sending that as two lines?

Because if it is, that's almost certainly why it doesn't work.  AFAIK,
tinyfugue cannot span multiple lines with regexp.

But if that's just the normal line wrap...  it should be working exactly as
it is.

Good Day TF users and developers. I hope your day is going better than
mine. *sigh*
I was wondering if I was using regexp and and repeat, send correctly.
for some reason after setting target sometimes it works and sometimes
it stop working.
Seems as though venomv isn't working as it should be as well.

Below is how I'm using it. Have any of you ever had problems with
variables not sticking.
I believe that to be the issue because when I /t target then try to
hit that target there is nothing in %{target} so it won't fire.
;; Targeting
/def t = /set target %1 %; /send st tar %1
/def ed = envenom %1 with %2

/def -b ds = /if (rebounding_shield = 1) /send dstab %{target} %;
/send smoke skullcap %; \
 /else /send dstab %{target} %; /endif

;;Venom Tracking
/set venomv 0

/def -b 1 = /ed dirk epteth %; /ed dirk epteth %; /set venomv 1

;; Dstab Illusions
/def ept = \
 /send conjure %{target} illusion \
Your right leg is greatly damaged from the beating.\\nYour left leg is
greatly damaged from the beating. %; \
/repeat -2 1 /send conjure %{target} illusion \
Abdas pricks you twice in rapid succession with his dirk.\\nA prickly,
stinging sensation spreads through your body.

/def -mregexp -t"^You prick (.*) twice in rapid succession with your
dirk.$" double_epteth_illusion = \
 /if (venomv = 1) /ept %; /endif

Bit of a fun one here: when using /edit a few times over using macro
numbers instead of names, Tinyfugue will proceed to start breaking
itself down and eventually crashing. What fun. Perhaps what I want to
accomplish is easier done: I am trying to turn off a series of macros
by setting the chance of execution to zero with /edit. The on/off
being in the form of name_of_macro_*. The asterisk getting me a bunch
of macros in that 'group', I use /list and a rematch to pull out all
the macro numbers and then run them through a /while loop to edit them
in turn. When I do this, all hell breaks lose at the last step.

Hello Brian,

If I understand what you wrote correctly, here's my solution.

What I usually do is to use a global variable containing 0 or 1 to
disable or enable a group of triggers.  I assume you specifically
meant triggers when you use "chance of execution" for macros.

For example:
/set trig_a 1

/def -E{trig_a} -t"catch me" trigger_a = /echo foo

Here, trigger_a will only fire if the content of trig_a is 1 and of
course there's a text "catch me" from the server.  It won't fire if
trig_a is 0.

I hope this helps.

That is my usual approach, I was hoping to have something on a
different level; a enable/disable was was independent of the macros in
question.

Good Day, I just had a real quick question to see if I understand this
correctly.
I am trying to track what my target cures during a fight via highlight
so I notice
it. Is this the proper way to do so.

 /set hiliteattr=BCgreen

/def -ah -mregexp -t"%{target} eats a goldenseal root."

Can variables be use like that within triggers?
Thank you in advance,
Patrick

To answer your question.  Yes.  Altho, I dont set the hiliteattr outside
of the trigger, I do it as part of the def, like so

/DEF -F -aBCgreen -mregexp -t"%{target} eats a goldenseal root.$" cure_lite =


I find it handy to name all my triggers, makes it easy to manage them.
Also you could throw in a -i to make it invisible so it won't show up with
/list.  One other way you could also do it would be....

/DEF -F -P0BCgreen -t"%{target} eats a goldenseal root.$" cure_lite =

The -P flag denotes a partial hilite, and implies regexp matching.  I like to use
the -F flag also when its possible you may want to trigger something else on
the same line, as it makes it fall-thru

How can my triggers just randomly work or not work at all,
what's going on? They were working like a charm before today.
TinyFugue version 5.0 beta 8
this what i have venomv set to a value.
/set venomv 0

/def  kc = /ed kalmia dirk %; /ed curare dirk %; /set venomv 1 %;
/send partytell %{venomv}
/def  kx = /ed kalmia dirk %; /ed xentio dirk %; /set venomv 2 %;
/send partytell %{venomv}
/def  kv = /ed kalmia dirk %; /ed vernalius dirk %; /set venomv 3 %;
/send partytell %{venomv}
/def  k = /ed kalmia dirk %; /ed aconite dirk %; /set venomv 4 %;
/send partytell %{venomv}
/def  gs = /ed gecko dirk %; /ed slike dirk %; /set venomv 5 %; /send
partytell %{venomv}
/def  et = /ed epteth dirk %; /ed epteth dirk %; /set venomv 6 %;
/send partytell %{venomv}
/def  a = /ed aconite dirk %; /ed curare dirk %; /set venomv 7 %;
/send partytell %{venomv}
/def  v = /ed voyria dirk %; /ed aconite dirk %; /set venomv 8 %;
/send partytell %{venomv}
/def  de = /ed delphinium dirk %; /ed delphinium dirk %; /set venomv 9
%; /send partytell %{venomv}
/def  sm = /ed slike dirk %; /ed monkshood dirk %; /set venomv 10 %;
/send partytell %{venomv}
/def  pc = /ed prefarar dirk %; /ed curare dirk %; /set venomv 11 %;
/send partytell %{venomv}
/def  du = /ed darkshade dirk %; /ed euphorbia dirk %; /set venomv 12
%; /send partytell %{venomv}
/def  ep = /ed epseth dirk %; /ed epseth dirk %; /set venomv 13 %;
/send partytell %{venomv}

the above works since i can see the value of venomv being announce in
party channel.

/def ill_1 = \
 /send conjure %{target} illusion \
Your right leg is greatly damaged from the beating.\\nYour left leg is
greatly damaged from the beating.

/def ill_2 = \
 /send conjure %{target} illusion \
You look about yourself nervously.\\nYou gasp as your fine-tuned
reflexes disappear into a haze of confusion.

/def ill_3 = \
 /send conjure %{target} illusion \
You are feeling far too passive to do that.\\nA prickly*stinging
overcomes your body, f*ding away into numbness.

/def ill_4 = \
 /send conjure %{target} illusion \
You feel light headed and dizzy.\\nYou are confused as to the effects
of the venom.

/def ill_5 = \
/send conjure %{target} illusion \
The thought of speech seems difficult all of a sudden.\\nYour mind
swims as dizziness overtakes you.

/def ill_6 = \
 /send conjure %{target} illusion \
You swoon as you suffer a toxic relapse.\\nYour vision is flooded with
light, and your face suddenly reddens.

/def ill_7 = \
 /send conjure %{target} illusion \
Your mind swims as dizziness overtakes you.\\nYour limbs grow heavy
and you groan feebly.

/def ill_8 = \
 /send conjure %{target} illusion \
Your mind swims as dizziness overtakes you.\\nThe idea of eating or
drinking is repulsive to you.

/def ill_9 = \
 /send conjure %{target} illusion \
A sense of extreme nausea washes over you.\\nA pr*ckly stinging
overcomes your body, fading*away*into numbness.

/def ill_10 = \
 /send conjure %{target} illusion \
Your mind feels suddenly dulled and slow.\\nA prickly*stinging
overcomes your body, f*ding away into numbness.

/def ill_11 = \
 /send conjure %{target} illusion \
Your mind feels suddenly dulled and slow.\\nYour mind swims as
dizziness overtakes you.

The above iil_number commands works i can fire them off like /ill_1
and they work like a charm.
The triggers below is where the problem starts, maybe I'm
misunderstanding something.
They was working fine until today and all I did was just add the last
trigger to this below list of triggers
now they don't work at all and sometimes they work once.

I was wondering am I using the if statement correctly or is there a
limit to how many times i can
use this trigger on the same variable. I notice as well sometimes they
would work only once but then
not again after that. Other times they just don't work at all is this
just me or TF causing this problem.

Well, one thing that I noticed was that you were triggering on the same text and none of these triggers was designated as a fall-thru trigger, allowing the same text to be triggered multiple times.  You might want to consider a more monolithic approach and use if-elseif, like so:

/def -F -mregexp -t"^You prick (.*) twice in rapid succession with your dirk.$" kalmia_illusion = \ 
 /if (venomv = 1) /ill_5 %; /repeat -2.1 1 /ill_3 %; 
 /elseif (venomv = 2) /ill_6 %; /repeat -2.1 1 /ill_2 %;
 /elseif (venomv = 3) /ill_9 %; /repeat -2.1 1 /ill_7 %;
 /elseif (venomv = 4) /ill_4 %; /repeat -2.1 1 /ill_5 %;
 /elseif (venomv = 5) /ill_9 %; /repeat -2.1 1 /ill_8 %;
 /elseif (venomv = 6) /ill_1 %; /repeat -2.1 1 /ill_11 %;
 /elseif (venomv = 7) /ill_10 %; /repeat -2.1 1 /ill_7 %;
 /elseif (venomv = 8) /ill_6 %; /repeat -2.1 1 /ill_5 %;
 /elseif (venomv = 9) /ill_4 %; /repeat -2.1 1 /ill_2 %;
 /elseif (venomv = 10) /ill_1 %; /repeat -2.1 1 /ill_6 %;
 /elseif (venomv = 11) /ill_5 %; /repeat -2.1 1 /ill_2 %;
 /elseif (venomv = 12) /ill_5 %; /repeat -2.1 1 /ill_3 %;
 /elseif (venomv = 13) /ill_11 %; /repeat -2.1 1 /ill_1 %;
 /endif 

This way you are matching the text only once, and tf will cycle thru checking the value of venomv and perform the requested action.  Also I put a -F switch to allow additional matches with the same text, on different triggers.  I hope this makes sense, been a long day and rather late for me  :)

When I shell out, Tinyfugue kind of "hangs" until the external script
finishes running.

Here's an example of me calling it: /repeat -4 1 /sh -q ruby flying.rb >
fly-stuff.txt

When I call it, the screen goes blank, once flying.rb is done running, I get
a comment to press any key to get back to Tinyfugue, and then I get my
normal screen back.

Here is some of the relevant help for /sh:

  In visual mode, /sh and /psh will fix the screen first, and restore it
after
  executing the shell.  /Sys does not.

  If the -q option is given, /sh will be quiet: the SHELL hook will not be
  called, and the "Executing" line will not be printed.

  If the %{shpause} and %{interactive} flags are on, TF will wait for a
  keypress before returning.

Here's some help for /sys:

  Executes <shell-command>.  The command is executed without a tty, so it
  should have no input, and its output, if any, should be plain text.  The
  command's stdout and stderr are echoed to tf's output window.  /sys
differs
  from /sh in that /sys can not do an interactive shell command, but does
not
  redraw the screen or produce any extra messages.

I think what I was hoping for was a mode that looked like the way /sys
works, but I also want to be able to feed it input (I don't really care
about the output, I just like to have it as a visual record to confirm
everything worked).

Is there something I can do to call scripts in (the linux version of)
Tinyfugue which *won't* blank my screen while the script is running, so that
I can continue to do things with my character while my shell command is
processing?

I have a regexp that has to match any number of letters or spaces (works
correctly). However, each match has an annoying number of *only* trailing
spaces I'd like to strip.

Is there a macro function that strips trailing spaces (or some sort of strip
that can be configured to only remove trailing spaces)?

As cell phones/tablets/etc are becoming more popular, I thought I'd mention
a thread on configuring Tinyfugue on small screen devices over at maemo.org,
the home of the debian-based nokia line of tablets that ended with the n900
(a cellphone/tablet I use for Tinyfugue). The n800 and n900 still have a
loyal (if small) following.

Here on page 4 of the Tinyfugue thread there's some information about
setting up the screen using the xkbd virtual keyboard:

http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=20544&page=4

Here on page 7 user Addison is updating his .tfrc making everything fit
nicely on the 800x480 screen:

http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=20544&page=7

Here's an image from page 8 in the thread, showing that he (seems to have)
replaced the standard xkbd layout he was using earlier with a customized
version that provides labeled keys for each of his common activities (cure,
search, take, rest, etc).

http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1792/screenshot2011090519184.png

Hopefully this will inspire some folks to dig into the underpinnings of
their mobile devices and get tinyfugue up and running.

If xkbd is too much for you (or won't run on your device), as long as you
can telnet/ssh out, there's always the option to connect to screen on a
remote shell account and MU* from there.

/set Cpink=3Drgb535

Any clues what I'm doing wrong?

I play on a crystal-mining game that makes use of musical scales. I've
mentioned this many times in the past. :)

I'm not at all musically inclined. When I have to do something a little bit
fiddly or out of the normal pattern, I have to write the required cutting
pattern on a post-it and stick it to my monitor/screen.

I would like to be able to print something to the screen, and save a few
trees.

What I'd like is something in 2 lines.

Sorry, gmail decided to 'send' when I hit 'tab'.

line one:
 _ do_ mi _ so _ dx _ ti _
line two:
     _ re _  fa  _  la _

I would like things in the second row to line up so that "re" appears
beneath but between "do" and "mi", "fa" appears beneath and between "mi" and
"so" and "la" appears beneath and between "so" and "dx".

However, "do" through "dx" should not be those words, instead they should be
values from variables set up by other triggers. Something like %{CM_MAP_DO}
through  %{CM_MAP_DX}

Anyone have any useful tips on getting things lined up and "pretty" looking?
Whenever I print multiple rows to a screen, it tends to be a big blobby
mess.

Gwen

  I have a regexp that has to match any number of letters or
  spaces (works correctly). However, each match has an annoying
  number of *only* trailing spaces I'd like to strip.
  Is there a macro function that strips trailing spaces (or some
  sort of strip that can be configured to only remove trailing
  spaces)?
  Gwen

Hi Gwen!

The solution that springs to my mind is to add onto the regex end a
requirement that has to be a letter, not a space.

Not sure what your original regex looks like but something like [a-zA-Z
]*[a-zA-Z] for 'any number of letters and spaces, followed by a letter
only' - if this doesn't help include the original regexp please?

I'll tweak my original regexp - this should work "just fine" :). Thanks!

I would have suggested a lookahead against a space, or simply refining
how you desire it matched. Depends on your needs. I agree the answer
is in a better regexp rather than a function to strip ending spaces.

I was looking at the problem the wrong way :). I'm almost entirely
self-taught (I took a few programming classes as part of network training in
my now distant past but I'm in no-way a "programmer"). Every now and then I
have trouble with looking at the problem the wrong way.

What I was thinking was "how do I get rid of all these spaces?", while as
Bobby pointed out, I should have been thinking "what is the last character
I'll want to match?"

It's all fixed and working as expected.

You could make a seperate macro that just prints notes to the screen
and takes stuff as input, like this:

/DEF printnote = \
        /ECHO _ %{1} _ %{2} _ %{3} _ %{4} _ %{5} _ %; \
        /ECHO -p @{x}   _ %{6} _ %{7} _ %{8} _ %; \

Please note that the 2nd echo with -p @{x} is just a haxxor to allow
leading spaces, altho, if you wanted to you could use the @ feature to
set attributes to the text.  Anyway, if I call this macro like such:

/printnote do mi so dx ti re fa la

The output is:

_ do _ mi _ so _ dx _ ti _
   _ re _ fa _ la _

Except stupid webmail and non-monospace font screws it up for me
as I'm typing this.  Anyway I hope this helps, or gets you thinking in
the right direction.

Thanks, I'll try it and come back if I have further questions. I had
the same trouble with the font spacing in gmail, that's why I
explicitly stated "re between do and mi" etc. Once I get the words to
line up I should be able to swap in variables.

I was speaking to someone on the MUSH I play on and they said this is a
known issue with 64-bit compiles. Lo and behold, Google shows the bug. I'm
not sure why I get the same crash on my phone, I would have thought ARM was
only 32-bit. But all my other *nix systems are 64-bit.

Still, this is a known issue and it means I'm not setting anything wrong in
my .tfrc (my suspected culprit until now).

What is the way to compile Tinyfugue to be 32-bit on a 64-bit system, when
building it from source?

Good to know!

Would it be possible to send a copy of the patch to the mailing list (for

So, just to be clear, you have the tf-python patch _plus_ the fix for the
64-bit /ps crash one of those source bundles?

I like tf with python, that's a good thing to me!!!

If the answer is yes, is there any way you could also patch in the tinyfugue
lua patch into a source bundle that also has python and the 64-bit fix?

I can apply single patches and build from source, but I don't know enough to
apply multiple patches. If they fail (presumably because line numbers
change) I'm SOL.

Gwen

PS - the Tf + lua patch is here:

I'll try building under cygwin and seeing if it works. I don't use anything
I can't build under cygwin as well as linux. That way my tf's are consistent
across systems.

The specific patch for this issue has also been submitted to the tracker
and was picked up by Ken, to be included in the next release
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1650992&group_id=186112&atid=915972

I have also included it as an attachment. This works for me.

I don't mean this in a snarky way (tone is so difficult in email)...but
*will* there be future versions of Tinyfugue? I think it's been at the same
build for 3 or 4 years now? It seems rather frozen at this point.

I've been reading about the patches people wrote for telnet sub-negotiation
(interesting although a bit over my head). It made me realize that MUD
coding is not actually fixed...it's going foward with new updates and
changes as communications protocols change. It would be kind of nice if
Tinyfugue continued to be updated as well. But, since I'm not Ken, I don't
know what he's thinking and what changes he will (or will not) allow on the
official release.

I know it can always be forked in such a way that the fork is actively
developed, but I'd rather not see that. There's such a small user base in
the first place that we don't need...erm...version wars to make it even
smaller. But it is being sort of unofficially forked (things like the source
bundles posted in the previous message). That means that there's useful
changes out there, but they may not be instantly compatible with each other
(like lua + python, rather than just one or the other) or available to all
users (more and more people are depending on package managers to get their
software and if they don't make it into the official version they don't get
the update).

I've been wondering about this for a while but I've been really hesitant to
ask on the list. I'm not in a position to edit the source myself, and I know
it's very easy to come across as a spoiled user demanding other people put
in the time to give 'me' updates. I'm just wondering if Tinyfugue has a
development future, if Ken even has any interest in continuing to update it,
if new devs might be added to the sourceforge project, etc.

Gwen

I must echo your disclaimer: I don't mean the following in a negative 
way, just as my opinion about the reality of Tinyfugue.

I consider TF to be a dead project, or at the very least to have both 
feet in the grave.  I'm guessing Ken has moved on and doesn't do much 
in the way of MU* gaming any more, so his personal need for TF is 
diminished or nonexistent.

It's also likely that Ken is quite busy with that horrible thing 
called Real Life. Eek.

I know from experience that it's hard to support, much less enhance 
software you don't personally use any more.

I have a cut command for the mining game I play on of growing complexity.

What I'd like to do is have a way to chain commands together into a
larger queue.

An example of the sort of command I'd type now is:

/orderfill 1234

What I'd like to do is have some sort of 'chain' command, where I
could have other commands it would step through, only after the
existing command was complete.

So, I could type something like "/orderfill 1234"
Then, I could type "/chain /orderfill 2345" and it would finish 1234,
and then automatically start special order 2345.

Then other times I might want to use "/chain /cut market very small",
and then when the special order is done, call my /cut script and cut
to the best market size in very small crystals. /orderfill and /cut
have already been written and already function as well as I can
possibly want.

Gwen,

There are some macros out there that implement a 'queue' system. I
integrated them into my MUD playing code, but I will look for the
original stuff and let you know.

I have working code here:

([A-Za-z-,& \(\)]+)(\.|\.\.)$' claim_builder = \
        /set CLAIM_BUILDER=%P1

We have mini areas in my mining game. People go in to claims and solve small
text puzzles to get to the crystal vein where they can mine their crystals.
We also have a spreadsheet of solutions for each claim puzzle. I'd rather be
able to get the solution while in my client, instead of having to tab to a
spreadsheet.

What my code does: it checks the room description, and finds the area in an
array based on that name (providing the puzzle solution to that area in the
"path").

Because some first rooms to different claim areas have the same name (for
example, more than one area that's called "Wide Ledge"), I need a way to
differentiate between them. I check the 'credits' (the name of the person
who coded the area). No two claim areas have the same starting room and same
creator.

I'm having some trouble with the matching on the creator, and there's at
least one area that just won't match even though regexp-wise everything is
clean. It occurs me that in most (possibly all) of the problem areas, the
first room name is unique.

If I didn't check the credits on every claim, only those with duplicated
first room names, I could solve some of my matching problems and have more
efficient code (not searching an extra level of the array when it's not
needed).

I've renamed all the variables and slightly changed the match code to avoid
conflicts with the original code.

I'm not sure if I'm using length incorrectly (I want the number of items in
the list CL_ROOM_LIST to determine if there's 1 first room name match or
more than one match), or there's some problem with the flow of how I broke
things up into the if/else.

Is the original queue code possibly this?

http://www.gwen-morse.com/wiki/index.php/Zallafar%27s_Queue_Array

Gwen

i hadn't looked at it too closely when I archived it, I thought it was
more array code (rather than an actual queue system).

I'll fiddle with this and see if I can get it to do what I want.
However, if you do have something else I'd always love to have it for
archival purposes.

Gwen

No, it is not that one.

It is "mylib.tf" by Ian Leisk, dated 2005.

Included in it are functions such as:

get_array(), put_array(), list_array(), push_stack(), pop_stack_first()

and a bunch more. It is similar to Galvins code in places, so some of it
may have a common source, but the credits were not in the file when I
got hold of it, so I do not know for sure.

Since you have my macro package already downloaded, I re-named it
'utilities.tf' if you wanted to put it up on your wiki.

Here's most of the rgb codes converted to color names.
Just missing the greyscale.

I worked it out using the hex codes, and renamed things so that every
name is unique (at least I think I found all the duplicates).

I'm just missing the grey scale. That should be easy for any single
person to do, there's only a few of them to do.

The /length macro defined in lisp.tf is documented as echoing the number
of words, but it would be more accurate to say it /results the number of
positional parameters.  When called in macro form, e.g.
    /length foo bar baz
positional parameters and words are the same thing.  But when called in
function form, as you have, positional parameters are the arguments to
the function.  You always call length() with one argument, {CL_ROOM_LIST},
so it will always return 1.

That's a very helpful response, I understand (mostly) why it's not working =
now.

I need to use /list macro instead of list() function.

I am having trouble calling /list in such a way that I can set a
variable with the result (or directly pass the result to a check)

/set CL_LIST_LEN=3D/eval /length %{CL_ROOM_LIST}%;\
/test CL_LIST_LEN :=3D /eval /length %{CL_ROOM_LIST}%;\
/eval /set CL_LIST_LEN=3D/length %{CL_ROOM_LIST}%;\


I also tried some things with test and %?

I can envision using /test to evaluate the results and then passing %?
on to my if FOO is gt 1 elseif check.  However, /test is not working.
I think _maybe_ /test works better with functions (all the examples I
find are function tests).

/eval seems to work with macros (the examples are macros). None of the
bits of code I'm poking through are turning up evals where you set a
variable in the eval. I could just run the length through eval
(/length %{CL_ROOM_LIST}%;\) but I don't see in the help where eval
returns something I can use for my if/elseif check (or set into a
variable to use the variable in if/elseif). Poking around with %{*} as
the possible returned value isn't working ( /length %{CL_ROOM_LIST}%;\
/set CL_LIST_LEN=3D%{*} )

So, I understand what I did wrong, but I still am not getting what the
'right' fix is.

I don't use either test or eval without copying over some larger
snippet that just works, so I don't really understand what either does
on a fundamental level.

Since I was informed by the tf sourceforge page that this mailing list
was defunct (paraphrased), I ended up posting my code for an external
window to which captured channels / messages / etc can be sent. It's
in the tf forums (open discussion) on sourceforge, but if no one wants
to go read it I can repost it here. Just lemme know.

ok. this takes a few steps so bear with me.

first things first, edit your .tfrc file. you want to have these two
lines placed in there:

/addworld chans
/load <your_tf_dir>/testchans.tf

now you want to go to your tf dir and add a file named testchans.tf

in it, put this:

/def -p1 -mglob -wchans -hCONNECT chanshook = \
    /load <your_tf_dir>/chans.tf

this little puppy will let you load the chans tf file in its own world
using your tfrc file. i find this to make my life much easier.
otherwise i'd have to open a tf window, run tf with no connection, and
load the chans.tf file every time i wanted to use it. huge waste of my
time. i suppose depending on how you load tf you could skip the above
part.

next up we get to the actual mandatory stuff. first, in your tf dir,
make a file called chans.tf

you'll want it to look something like this:

/def updatechans = \
    /let file <your_tf_dir>/chan_capture.txt%; \
    /let chanread=%; \
    /let chan_read_stream $[tfopen(file, "r")]%; \
    /while (tfread(chan_read_stream, chanread) != -1) \
        /if (chanread !~ "") \
            /eval /echo -p %chanread%; \
        /endif%; \
    /done%; \
    /test $[tfclose(chan_read_stream)]%; \
    /unset chan_read_stream%; \
    /let chan_read_stream $[tfopen(file, "w")]%; \
    /if (!tfwrite(chan_read_stream, "")) \
        /return -1%; \
    /endif%; \
    /test $[tfclose(chan_read_stream)]%; \
    /unset chan_read_stream

/repeat -1 i /updatechans

now, first off, if you want to change that filename go right ahead,
just be consistent with the change cause i use it in the next file
i'll show you too.

If you need explanations of this file or the next file let me know. I
originally wrote an explanation that was geared towards people who had
no idea how tfio worked, etc, and I don't want to insult you guys with
it.

ok, so that's over with. next up we get to the actual meat of the
capturing. make the last file, capture.tf, and put this in it:

/def do_chan_setup = \
    /let chan_file ~/.tf/chan_capture.txt
    /if (chan_setup) \
        /return%; \
    /else \
        /if (chan_stream !~ "") \
            /test $[tfclose(chan_stream)]%; \
            /unset chan_stream%; \
        /endif%; \
        /set chan_stream $[tfopen(chan_file, "w")]%; \
        /if (!tfwrite(chan_stream, "Channel Capture Window")) \
            /eval /echo -p % Error writing to chan capture file from
creation.%; \
            /return -1%; \
        /endif%; \
        /test tfclose(chan_stream)%; \
        /unset chan_stream%; \
        /set chan_stream $[tfopen(chan_file, "a")]%; \
    /endif%; \
    /set chan_setup 1

/do_chan_setup

/def addchan = \
    /let cn %{*}%; \
    /let chan_capture $(/expr %{cn}_capture)%; \
    /if (chan_capture) \

        /return%; \
    /endif%; \
    /def -mregexp -t'^(?!\\d{2}\\:\\d{2}\\:\\d{2}

                /eval /echo -p % Could not write to chan capture file

            /endif%%; \
        /def -F -p20 -mregexp -t'^[\\\\S]+' %{cn}_chan_cap2_kill = \
            /undef %{cn}_chan_cap2%%%; \
            /undef %{cn}_chan_cap2_kill

/def rmchan = \
    /let cn %{*}%; \
    /let chan_capture $(/expr %{cn}_capture)%; \
    /if (!chan_capture) \
        /eval /echo -p % You are not currently capturing that channel
(%{cn}).%; \
        /return -1%; \
    /endif%; \
    /undef %{cn}_chan_cap1%; \
    /undef %{cn}_chan_cap2%; \
    /undef %{cn}_chan_cap2_kill%; \
    /unset %{cn}_capture%; \
    /eval /echo -p % You are no longer capturing the channel %{cn}.

now load capture.tf either manually or set it up to load at the start.
if you want to you can also automatically set certain channels to
capture. i actually don't like to use channel capturing (i made this
for a friend) so i don't do that myself.

I'm going to quickly explain the regexp in the addchan macro. On my
mud, we have channels, private messages (tells), and room messages
(says). Each race has its own say verb, so the say regexp doesn't work
off of a single verb like "says". tells look like "Blah tells you:" or
"You tell blah :". channel names are always nested between brackets or
something, but do not necessarily start with the name of the person
talking on the channel (you can emote on channels, at which point it
might say [chat]: Foobar does something.

the (?!\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}) has to do with the fact that on my MUD you
can also see a history of channels/says/tells, and the history is
different because it starts with a timestamp (hr:mn:sc) and I didn't
want to recapture histories.

Lastly, the regexp is not perfect. namely, if someone were to write on
the chat channel so that it said: Foo [chat]: Bar [newbie]: xyz and
you are not capturing chat but you are capturing newbie, it will still
capture this. I've come up with a theoretical way to do it, but I
haven't put it in and tried it out. mea culpa. If i get something for
that scenario I'll let you know. Generally I assume that since the
triggered regexp on your mud may vary in a large way you will probably
have to fiddle with it anyway, so I'm sure you'll figure it out.

Again, if you have questions about how the macros work, or how the
tfio works, etc, let me know and I can tell you. I just don't want to
fill this up with explanations for people who have no clue if everyone
is going to understand it anyway. :)

btw, may not be obvious but you do actually have to manually open tf
twice, once for your capture window and once for your char's window.

This looks nifty. You might want to mention the game you play on. :)

The sourceforge page says the list is dead, but the messages come up
in google searches. It helps other people who play on the game to find
related tinyfugfue macros.

The MUD is called Islands of Myth. Though I've already posted it on
the news section there so that the 2 or 3 other people who use TF can
tell me how awesome I am. I have an external status window I might
post here later too, which keeps track of all the buffs I am in
control of on myself or others. It's pretty similar code, but I'd have
to disect the part of my buff duration-tracking code that contains
references to the external window and see how hard it is to just give
you that without the 300-400 line buff tracker.

Well, hasn't been RD since the schism in 2003. That was fun times. But
yea, I was around back then and IoM is still going, though we've gone
from a high in the 2005-2006 era of 100 players to a high of 30-40
players, 75% of whom are idle. And maybe 2 active admin (myself
included).

I have a question, and it probably boils down to terminal type or so, but anyway...

I used to putty into a solaris box, they were running tf5b6 or b7 or so, and from within tf, if I typed ctrl-p it would repeat the last line and put the cursor at the end of the line.  If I hit uparrow it would repeat the last line and put the cursor at the beginning of the line.

I found this extremely handy.  Now, I play with tf5b8 on a linux box (poor katie.vnet.net got shut down) and ctrl-p and uparrow give the same behavior now.  Repeat last line and put cursor at the end of the text.  Anybody know how I can get uparrow to put the cursor to the beginning of the line rather than the end?

Thanks

--Tommy

Seems I have to send it from another e-mail address to get past the
Sourceforge filters. ;-)

You could try one of the following. The first searches backwards, the other
is a simple rolodex.

/def key_up = /dokey searchb%; /dokey_home

/def key_up = /dokey_recallb%; /dokey_home

I'm back to MUDing for a bit and I realize that earlier issues with
tinyfugue "lagging" only occur when I have the MUD connection open.

I went through and stripped everything except my logger and my world
definitions from my .tfrc. Still laggy.

It occurs to me that it may have something to do with either how tf
relates to this game, or MUDing in general.

I know there's something called a 'tick' and looking at /help tick it
relates to Diku MUDS. I'm playing on Realms of Despair, a SMAUG game
but I know that its related to a Diku-style MUD. So, this server may
tick.

Reading through /help timing, /help tick, and /help prompts gives me
some useful information. But, I'm still at least somewhat confused.

When I type a command into the MUD buffer, it doesn't always process
immediately. Instead, sometimes it pauses for about 3 seconds.

It most often pauses when I"m repeating a command (for example, I type
'cast valiance' to buff myself, fail, and immediately try to cast it
again). But, it doesn't always happen when repeating, it's just a
noticeable pattern.

Also only sometimes, when I type a command it will hang and then show
the details of the prompt just before giving me my results, like so:

311/311 HP 17/204 mana 380/380 Mvs South. Mts 90,057 G 246,592 LE
()You don't have enough mana.

Sometimes it hangs but everything looks normal.

Other times it will hang and there will be an extra blank line:

You failed.

You failed.


The Darkhaven guard leaves north.

(There's an extra line between the second You failed and The Darkhaven guard).

Sometimes the game will hang really badly and I'll get multiple
messages like this:


311/311 HP 44/204 mana 355/380 Mvs New Darkhaven 90,057 G 246,592 LE ()
The Darkhaven guard arrives from the west.

311/311 HP 44/204 mana 355/380 Mvs New Darkhaven 90,057 G 246,592 LE ()
Asleth floats in from the north.
Theon flies in from the north.
The Darkhaven guard bows before Theon.
The Darkhaven guard bows before Asleth.

311/311 HP 44/204 mana 355/380 Mvs New Darkhaven 90,057 G 246,592 LE ()
Asleth floats south.
Theon flies south.


Those 3 clusters of lines came in at a single "unlag" swarm.

Is this all related to the tick and prompts? Is it because the prompt
is unterminated and tf is trying to guess what lines are the actual
prompt?  Whether it is or not, does anyone out there know the cause
and also how to fix it?
This has been driving me nuts for a while and it would be really nice
to sort out a fix.

Gwen

Next time it hands, hit ^C, then hit C) Continue, and see if it's

Not interrupting anything I can see. The two "obvious" clues are extra
blank lines and the prompt showing up in the output window.

Also, I don't remember if I said this earlier but when things hang, my
prompt does not update in the input area. I've written a little macro
that echos the time every 10 seconds, and this "helps" the issue
somewhat (I tried this when I read that sometimes the prompt has
trouble if the screen isn't refreshed with new text). Things still
hang but not as often. However, it's spammy and doesn't fix the
underlying problem.

I know we Tinyfugue users disdain (at least for the most part) any
sort of GUI 'crutches' to playing on our games. But, I stumbled across
this elsewhere and thought I'd share it with the list.

It's Nick Gammon, programmer of MUSHclient, running on a MUD with a
hybrid semi-gui interface: There's little pop-up windows of monsters
and you can right click to attack them, and move around using the map
window. Kind of nifty:

I'm trying out a set of macros that may help me on my MUD. The last
time I tried them they didn't work but it was probably user error on
my part. This time, I'm only making the most minimal changes (keeping
the paths and everything else intact).

One issue, the default matching needs to be set to regexp. However, I
have a number (a large number) of macros for my crystal mining game
that use glob matching and they're not configured with the -mglob
flag.

Would something like this work to switch between the matching types
depending on what world I'm in?


;; Switch between Glob and Regular Expression matching
/def matching = \
  /if (${world_type} =/ "*diku*") \
    /set matching=regexp%;\
  /elseif (${world_type} =/ "*tiny*") \
   /set matching=glob%;\
  /else \
  /endif

/matching

Turns out I have bigger problems. If I /set matching to regexp, it
breaks the built-in /recall command. Looking at the log, it appears to
be a 64 bit tinyfugue error. Guess it's time to build it myself with
that patch sent to the list earlier.

If I /recall once only with an empty recall buffer I get this: %
RECALL: regexp error: character 0: (invalid string: segmentation
violation)

If I /recall again with an empty recall buffer, or /recall even once
with something that matches in the buffer, it crashes completely:
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Switching %matching will not work, because it will apply to triggers in
your background worlds as well as those in your foreground world.

Really the only solution is to not rely on %matching.  You need to
either explicitly add -mregexp to every trigger in this new set of
macros (which is what I recommend), or set matching=regexp and add
-mglob to every trigger in your own macros.  (And when I say triggers,
I actually mean any command that has a -m matching option:  /limit,
/recall, or any of the /list* commands.)

Ideally, any set of macros anyone writes intending to give to other users
should not make assumptions about the setting of %matching (or other
configurable options), but should use the -m option explicitly.  If you
take a look at the standard libraries, you'll see explicit -m options
on every command where it matters.

Yeah, I've fixed my own macros. It was only some glob matches that
weren't explicit and there were less than I thought.

I just don't relish fixing the new ones. It's about 8000 lines of code
including whitespace and comments. I'm going to have to though as
setting matching to regexp has broken /recall.

I get:
% RECALL: regexp error: character 0: nothing to repeat
even if there is something to repeat.

After patching Tinyfugue to the 64 bit version it at least no longer
crashes when using /recall.

I'm working on a very simple autoroller. It will compare the stats on
the screen to the minimums configured by the player and tell them if
they have a good set or a bad set. Once the logic is good I'll break
it up into a simple loop to reroll, being careful to make sure it
doesn't spam the game and get booted off.

Here's the entire .tfrc I'm working with to test this (the better to
make sure something else doesn't interfere).
;; Your character's base stats have been rerolled...
;; then go for like 18str/16+wis/14+dex/16lck and dump the rest in con

/addworld -Tdiku rod realmsofdespair.org 4000

;; Actual reroll reaquirements (for Paladin)
/set rod_str=18
/set rod_dex=14
/set rod_int=9
/set rod_wis=16
/set rod_cha=9
/set rod_con=12
/set rod_lck=16

;;; Dummy entries to test pass a success condition.
/set rod_str=9
/set rod_dex=9
/set rod_int=9
/set rod_wis=9
/set rod_cha=9
/set rod_con=9
/set rod_lck=9

Once the dummy entries are passing, I'll flip the order of these and
test with the real recommended stats.

What it does...
Reroll screens look like this

Your character's base stats have been rerolled...
                     New             Previous
Strength              17                   14
Dexterity             15                   14
Intelligence          12                   11
Wisdom                14                   16
Charisma              13                   14
Constitution          15                   15

I have a simple regexp that grabs the stat name plus the value of the
freshest roll (new). It sets values for each of the stat variables
until it reaches luck. After it reaches luck it sets the luck variable
and then has an if-else check to determine if the minimal stat rod_foo
above is greater than the fresh rolled stat. If all the new stats are
greater than the minimums it should print this This is a keeper
message below. Otherwise it will print a fail message based on the
first minimal stat to be greater than a rolled stat.

It doesn't work. The stats match properly, I can print them to the
screen and see it.

                     New             Previous

% rodroll_Wisdom=14
No Str match.
Luck                  14                   13

The No Strength Match line comes up (this is simply the first match to
be compared)

Here is the roller:

/def -F -p10000 -Tdiku -mregexp
-t"^(Strength|Dexterity|Intelligence|Wisdom|Charisma|Constitution|Luck)
\\s\\s\\s\\s ( +) ([0-9]?[0-9]) (.*)" rod_roller = \
  /set rodrollstat=%P1%;\
  /set rodrollval=%P3%;\
  /set rodroll_%rodrollstat=%rodrollval%;\
  /if (strlen(rodrollstat) & rodrollstat !~ "Luck") \
;   /echo TFRC: RODROLL Still processing. Shouldn't match %;\
  /elseif (strlen(rodrollstat) & rodrollstat =~ "Luck") \
;   /echo TFRC: RODROLL Done processing. Should match. Start match logic %;\
    /quote -S /set `/listvar -mglob -s rodroll_* %;\
    /if (rodrollstat_Strength < rod_str) \
      /echo No Str match. %;\
    /elseif (rodrollstat_Dexterity < rod_dex) \
      /echo No Dex match. %;\
    /elseif (rodrollstat_Intelligence < rod_int) \
      /echo No Int match. %;\
    /elseif (rodrollstat_Wisdom < rod_wis) \
      /echo No Wis match. %;\
    /elseif (rodrollstat_Charisma < rod_cha) \
      /echo No Cha match. %;\
    /elseif (rodrollstat_Constitution < rod_con) \
      /echo No Lck match. %;\
    /elseif (rodrollstat_Luck < rod_lck) \
    /else \
      /echo -aBCGreen TFRC: Good stats. This set is a keeper. %;\
    /endif %;\
  /else \
    /echo TRFC: RODROLL Broken! %;\
  /endif

Here is some mecho/secho output

+ TRIGGER: /rod_roller Luck                  18                   14

I hope to eventually put this same logic into one larger if statement.
Will an expression like this with 7 'or' checks be valid (assuming I
also fix the bad logic above?)

       /if (rodrollstat_Strength < rod_str \
      | rodrollstat_Dexterity < rod_dex \
      | rodrollstat_Intelligence < rod_int \
      | rodrollstat_Wisdom < rod_wis \
      | rodrollstat_Charisma < rod_cha \
      | rodrollstat_Constitution < rod_con \
      | rodrollstat_Luck < rod_lck ) \

I will sit down and give this a longer look later today but I will
initially say in way of improving it, your regexp is overly complex.

^(Strength|Wisdom)[ ]*([0-9]+)

Should be all you need. I would also recommend not using /set where
the variables are irrelevant outside of the macro execution and use
/let instead. Better memory management.

I'm not sure there aren't other situations where the stats will be
listed other than the rerolling line. That's why I specifically put
the spaces into the regexp.

I'll read up more on using /let instead of /set.

Also, I'll look forward to any answers on why the if/else checks are
failing when they shouldn't.

Darn it. Simple code that should have worked killed by a stupid typo
(or series of typos). AGAIN. This is like my previous 256 color match
that was foiled by forgetting the -C flag.

Thanks for persevering and figuring it out. It's at least a relief to
know that the logic is sound.

Some of you folks on the list really deserve cookies.

Anyone have examples of *working* (at least for their game)
automappers for Tinyfugue?

I've only recently discovered that automapping is not the same as
speedwalking, and when I google for automatter and tinyfugue the
pickings are slim.

These are the only macros I can find and they're reported as not working:

Just to clarify, when you say you can't imagine how heavy it would be
and that it's a bit above and beyond scripting alone...

You mean it would "probably" be too computationally intense for
tinyfugue to handle? Automapping is better done as an outside program?

So I guess this explains why I don't find automappers for it.

Is this the sort of thing better handled by the Lua or Python patches
in libraries?

just finished looking at my channel capture code, and i wanted to let
you guys know that if you switch the regexp of the 3 versions of
%{cn}_chan_cap1 so that where you have .+? you have [^:]+? and where
you have .*? you have [^:]*?, it'll work like a charm for those
situations where someone may quote someone from a channel you are
capturing on a channel you are not capturing. I'm sure that most of
you could get away with easier regexp in this trig but we have
costumes and they can have long involved names with spaces and stuff.

On my crystal mining game they've changed the code. Cartons used to be
numbered 1 through 10. Now they're named by color. They also include
something called a dbref (a unique database reference number). The
dbref is the part with the pound sign like #11947.

Mahogany Carton - Ssudia(#11947de$)
Melon Carton - Ssudia(#10248de$)
Brandy-Red Carton - Ssudia(#8028de$)
Reddish-Orange Carton - Ssudia(#7230de$)
Pine-Green Carton - Ssudia(#10327de$)
Cornflower Carton - Ssudia(#10236de$)
Burgundy Carton - Ssudia(#9868de$)
Greenish-Yellow Carton - Ssudia(#5689de$)

I have several macros that depend on being able to discriminate
between cartons. Since cartons are no longer numbered, I've been
trying to work with the color names. However, the carton colors can
duplicate. The dbref is the only way to make sure that I'm interacting
with the carton I want.

I need a way to consistently grab the dbref number on a carton. I can
see a simple way to get the dbref of the bottom carton in the list.
Unfortunately, I have to grab the top dbref in any listing. Any
suggestions?

Gwen

I would look at triggering a macro on the action/text that causes the
list to be displayed.

This macro then sets a one-time trigger that looks for the number and
sets a variable for you.

Then, once you get your command prompt back, you can look at the
variable and it will be the first line that matched, ie the first line
displayed.

/help car. Pretty sure you have to load a dependency.

/car one two three

Returns one.

And like

/cdr one two three

Returns two three.

I realized I may be answering the question with a different answer.

Of you are trying to get it off a list, use a regexp to trigger the
dbref and to disable itself from repeating on first match.

Something like /def -E(see_debref) -mregexp -t'#([a-z0-9]+)//$'
see_debref = /set see_debref 0 %; /echo %{P1}

There's no text that causes the list to be displayed. It happens when
I enter my "sled" (hovercraft) automatically, or alternatively when I
type the "look" command.

I guess rather than triggering on a command I could trigger on a match
of the string "Carton - Ssudia". Although that runs into problems with
turning the match off once I have the dbref I want, but it then
working the next time I get a listing.

There is no prompt :). I've learned how incredibly useful the prompt
can be, but MUSHes don't have them.

Just below is what a collection of stacked cartons looks like.
(Perhaps I should have said 'stack' instead of 'list'). Using list
seems to have been ambiguous. This is actually a stack programming
problems, isn't it? A stack that's FIFO instead of LIFO?

>> Mahogany Carton - Ssudia(#11947de$)
>> Melon Carton - Ssudia(#10248de$)
>> Brandy-Red Carton - Ssudia(#8028de$)
>> Reddish-Orange Carton - Ssudia(#7230de$)
>> Pine-Green Carton - Ssudia(#10327de$)
>> Cornflower Carton - Ssudia(#10236de$)
>> Burgundy Carton - Ssudia(#9868de$)
>> Greenish-Yellow Carton - Ssudia(#5689de$)

Looking at the above stack, the lines will be incoming as Mahogany;
then Melon, then Brandy-Red. Greenish-Yellow will come in last. In
this case, I would only want the dbref on the Mahogany carton. This is
the first in.

I'll go back and look at the pop and push functions in the library
that Keith is always recommending. But, IIRC that works off a list. Is
it really "worth" it to build a list and then pull one entry off the
list to get the dbref I want? It seems like a less than efficient
solution.

Don't worry about turning matches on and off.  Simply trigger on every line,
and test for that string.  Set a variable when you see it, unset it when you
see a line without it, and if the variable isn't set when you see it, you're
looking at the top one.

Before you worry about performance, it's trivial.  A matching trigger has to
test every line anyway.  If you're still worried, at least try it and
measure the difference.

You could make a client-side hook macro that sends a look, and also defines a 1-shot /def to grab the dbref from the first line.  Something like this should work:

/DEF -ag -h"send {getref}" get_dbref_init = \
     /DEF -mregexp -n1 -t"(.*) Carton - Ssudia\\((.*)de\\\$\\)" get_dbref = \
          /SET carton_dbref=%%{P2} %; \
     /SEND look

The hardest part of this trig is figuring out how many escaping \ you need to have on the 2nd macro, but this worked for me.  You could replace the 2nd (.*) the one after Ssudia with ([0-9#]*) to limit it.  But with this macro, if you were to just type
getref
from your command line, it would define that 1shot, and then send a 'look' command.  Which would give output containing lines of the containers, then trigger on only the 1st line it receives.  It is a somewhat kludgy fix for your problem, but it worked out ok for me while testing.

I use hooks alot on the game I play.  You can reincarnate your character to a completely different build, so I have files for each guild you can join with hooks to use skills or cast spells, rather than having to re-do the in-game command alias feature.

As always, hope this helps you some  :)

A one-shot seems like the best solution. It will only match the first
carton and then it will undefine itself, without having to worry about
setting/unsetting flags. This is exactly what I want. Thanks for the
suggestion, and thanks to everyone else for their other suggestions.

Earlier this evening I fixed up my other related macros. Tomorrow I
expect to have time to fix the one that absolutely needs the dbref.

Found out reading the help files of my game that I should always exit
by typing the word "QUIT". It apparently helps avoid something called
link death. I don't know if I've link died (all my equipment seems
intact) but it has happened to a friend of mine a few times now using
zMUD (she's disconnected and then been killed).

I exit a world by typing /dc. I have a special /dc hook that forces it
to act like a regular disconnect. This closes my automatic log files.

; Lets /dc function like 'QUIT' to trigger the disconnect (needed to
close the log)
; written by 'Brack <slayer at kaiwan dot com>'

/def -F -1ag -h'conflict' gagconflict
/def -Fiq dc = /if /@dc %*%; /then /trigger -hdisconnect %*%; /endif

Does this disconnection send the word "QUIT" to the game?

Neither /help /quit nor /help disconnect show what's sent to the game on exit.

To my knowledge, other than low level socket handling and a bit of
telnet negotiation in the background, TF doesn't send *anything* to
the server side without an explicit command to do so. I think what the
comment in that code refers to is that it makes /dc cause any
disconnect hooks *on the client end* to trigger, which is what sending
'quit' (or equivalent) will result in (usually after a short delay)
when the game server closes the connection from their end, but that's
all purely changing things on the client end. There's a very good
chance that /dc already does the 'right thing' in the way of telling
the server that the connection's closing from your end (the socket
handling I referred to), however, which should (dependent on the
server side code) be enough to prevent your sitting around like a
zombie server-side until the server times out waiting for something
from your end. "Link death" is aptly named because it's the state you
end up with when you unplug your computer from the network line,
giving a magical, instant, disappearance without any notification to
the server that you've gone away. Programs that don't do proper
'cleanup' when they're closed can result in the same (which is, I
would guess, what zmud is doing).

I actually haven't looked too closely at how /quit, /dc, etc vary from
the server's end. I may have to add a bit of debug code to see that
into my modifications to this little mapper proxy... if I ever get
time.

The simplest adjustment to see to it that you don't have *any* issues
from it would be to add in sending 'quit' to the server when /dc is
called, while the easiest way to test whether you're at risk as you
are would be to set up in the same (in game) room as your friend, /dc,
wait a minute or so while your friend pokes to see if you've gone
poof, then come back to get the answer as to whether you played zombie
for them or not :).

The short answer is no.

Since MUDs are generally combat oriented, their was a time when people
would just disconnect if they got into a fight and they were loosing.

So now you have to type "quit" in the game in order to cleanly disconnect.

You could add "send quit" to your /dc macro, but if you are in the wrong
place in the game, you are not allowed to quit and even though you think
you are safe, your character would still be in mortal danger!

I would recommend that you walk (or recall) to a safe place and then
manually type in the command. If all is OK, then you will be
disconnected by the remote end.

I was wondering if someone that uses the lua patch with tinyfugue, if
you could give an example of how you use lua with tf with your chosen
MUD. The help files is very terse.

it's been a looong time ;)

check lua/first.lua for something very basic. I haven't actually
written many scripts for it :)

Basically, read help on calllua and loadlua.

>From within lua, the only function you have is tf_eval, which
can execute any tf command you want.

Hope that helps.

I extended Patricks path and added one new command tf_getvar witch
allows lua to get tf variable.

I also wrote macros to connect to mySQL server and from that source im
making lot of triggers and other tricky stuff.

Its rather simple and straigthforward (if someone know lua), tf part is
really simple :)

Red parts are needed for gething value from lua to tf.
If you want just show something on the screen use tf_eval /echo and
thats all.

Part of my tf file:


/load_lua items.lua

/def _add_item = \
    /let _res=$(/calllua add_item %{1}|%{2}) %;\
    /result _res

/def whatis = \
    /calllua item_search %{*}


File items.lua:

dofile('functions.lua')
function add_item(str, attrs, line_attr)
    fields = { str:match( "^" .. ("([^\|]*)\|?"):rep(2) ) }
    if table.getn(fields) < 2 or fields[1]:len() < 1 or fields[2]:len() < 1 then
        return
    end 
    short = mescape(fields[1])
    long = mescape(fields[2])
--    tf_eval("/repeat -0.03 1  /echo S,L [" .. short .. "][" .. long .."]")
    item_id = select_single(string.format("SELECT item_id FROM t_item WHERE short = %s AND descr = %s", short, long))
    if not item_id then
        assert (conn:execute(string.format("INSERT INTO t_item VALUES ('', %s, %s, NOW())", short, long)))
        item_id = select_single("SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()")
    end
    echo(item_id)
end 

function item_search(str, t)
    mstr = conn:escape(str)
    query = "SELECT item_id, short, descr, added FROM t_item WHERE short LIKE '%" .. mstr .. "%' ORDER BY short";
    cur = assert(conn:execute(query))
    row = cur:fetch ({}, "a")
    while row do
        short = capitalize(row.short)
        msg(string.format("@{B}%s @{nCwhite}[%s]", short, row.added))
        row = cur:fetch (row, "a")
    end
    msg('Found @{B}' .. cur:numrows() .. '@{n} items!!')
    cur:close()
end


File functions.lua:

require('luasql.mysql')

function mescape(var)
    if (var == nil) then
        return var
    end     
    return "'" .. conn:escape(var) .. "'"
end 

if not conn then
    env = assert(luasql.mysql())
    conn = assert(env:connect("dbname", "user", "pass", "localhost"))
    conn:setautocommit(true)

I extended Patricks path and added one new command tf_getvar witch allows lua to get tf variable.<BR>
<BR>
I also wrote macros to connect to mySQL server and from that source im making lot of triggers and other tricky stuff.<BR>
<BR>
Its rather simple and straigthforward (if someone know lua), tf part is really simple :)<BR>
<BR>
Red parts are needed for gething value from lua to tf.<BR>

it's been a looong time ;)

check lua/first.lua for something very basic. I haven't actually
written many scripts for it :)

Basically, read help on calllua and loadlua.

&gt;From within lua, the only function you have is tf_eval, which
can execute any tf command you want.

Hope that helps.

First off forgive my ignorance of TF.
what I'm currently trying to do is make a my character more defense aware.
my current prompt looks like: 3828h, 3396m cexdb-
where is the c is only there if I have a cloak up if not then it look
like: 3828h, 3396m exdb
depending on what my character is doing the ex come and go depending if I have
equilibrium or balance.

My question was how could I check the prompt and if I have equilibrium
and balance and I don't have a cloak up to put the cloak up?

I've been playing with the 256 color patch and I have a question...

Is there something like the bold/non-bold setting for the colors? Is
there a way to "bold" any particular color from the 256 color cube. If
not, are some colors effectively the "bold" versions of others.

By that I mean (when looking at this chart)
http://www.mudpedia.org/wiki/Xterm_256_colors

Could 165 be the bold version of 171 and 213 be the bold version of 219?

I see along the top the color codes (bold and not) for the 16 color settings.

I'm trying to come up with visually pleasing pairs of colors for some
types of messages and I don't see anything that works like bold does
in the 16 color set. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to decide for myself
what is bolder than a less bold color.

Gwen

Here's my auto-idler

When poking around the sockets help I realized I could use the
is_connected function to determine if I am connected to any worlds.

/def idler = \

/idler

However, if I reload my .tfrc file for any reason (happens fairly
often), it will call /idler again (from the single line below the
macro).

Is there a way to configure it so it only calls it if it's not already
a running process?

I'm a dope. This idler only partially works as expected.

It's been looking like it's working because I have a secondary macro
that prints the
time when someone connects or disconnects in the watch list. Since I
watch everyone, it's usually quite active. I do this by using a server
command (rather than grabbing the time from Tinyfugue).

I had a background character idle off earlier tonight while testing
the idler code. It was a slow night and no one was
connecting/disconnecting. Poking at it a bit I figured out what was
happening.

world_info is really only useful in this case for the foreground
world. I need a function that will send to all worlds, foreground and
background. I looked at /listsockets but it prints the socket names to
the screen. I don't want to see the connected worlds in the incoming
text, I just want to silently send commands to them.

My idler code uses /listsockets to get a list of worlds, take a look: 
http://christianrobinson.name/tf/idler.tf

It also does not let itself be re-invoked if it's already running.

(I don't MU* any more, so I'm no longer maintaining my TF code.  I'm 
fairly sure this still works, but it may not be exactly what you 
want.)

What happened to the flash attribute? Looking at the help it says it's
accepted for backwards compatibility but ignored.

Having had it pointed out recently that I should be making more use of
/let (over /set) I've been trying to use it /let more often.

I've read the help for /let and it talks about scope. I vaguely
understand this, macros are a bit like subroutines or function calls.
I'm a little fuzzy on how things are expanded.

Looking at the snippet forwarded below, if I inserted a /let statement
in /cut, would /cut_loop be able to use it? Are those two different
expansions with their own scopes or does /cut_loop inherit local
variables created within /cut since /cut calls /cut_loop?

---------- Forwarded message ----------

Hopefully this will get you going in the right direction; it's very
incomplete code for what you want to do, just a "proof of concept"
example:

=A0/def cut =3D \
=A0 =A0/if (! {#}) \
=A0 =A0 =A0 /echo What do you want to cut? %;\
=A0 =A0/else \
=A0 =A0 =A0 /repeat -10 1 /cut_loop %{*} %; \
=A0 =A0/endif

=A0/def cut_loop =3D \
=A0 =A0/if ({#}) \
=A0 =A0 =A0 /echo %{1} %; \
=A0 =A0 =A0 /shift %; \
=A0 =A0 =A0 /repeat -10 1 /cut_loop %{*} %; \
=A0 =A0/endif

If /cut acutally *called* /cut_loop, then a variable /let by /cut
would exist in /cut_loop.  But /cut does not call /cut_loop; it
calls /repeat, which *schedules* /cut_loop to run at some later
time.  So a variable that was /let by /cut would cease to exist
when /cut ends, and would not exist when /cut_loop runs.

That explanation was very helpful. Thanks.

I'm working on a simple speedwalk for my crystal mining game.

This is what I'm starting with:

/def do_expand = \
   /let args=%*%; \
   /let i=0%; \
   /while ((i:=strchr(args, ",")) >= 0) \
       /eval $[substr(args, 0, i)]%; \
       /let args=$[substr(args, i+1)]%; \
   /done%; \
   /eval %args

It works but it sends the commands really fast. Some locations are
going to need a time delay beween particular commands. Is there a way
update this with a time delay?

Gwen

I wrote a speedwalker but it was quite complicated.  I have the concept of walkBalance.  Can't walk from one room to the next unless you have walkBalance.  Walking takes away walkBalance (sets it to false), various game messages take it away (like if I was forced to walk) and various messages indicate I have walk balance back.  But the major way, as you indicated, is based on a timer.

For my game (IRE) the game's walk timer doesn't start until I get a prompt back after issuing a walk command.  So I need to wait for the prompt.  Basically I set an additional flag when I take away walk balance that says I'm waiting for a prompt.  In my prompt hook, if this flag is set then I do a /repeat for the walk time that the game requires.  Note that this value needed to be tuned for my ping time.  Roughly, if the game requires half a second between walks, the timer value would be .5 secs - ping time.  But you really just have to fiddle with it by hand and see what works.  When the /repeat goes off then I set walkBalance back to true.  That feeds my command queuing.  After issuing a walk command, my speedwalk code queues up the next command, but it's waiting for walk balance to be restored.  On each prompt I go through the command queue and if a command has the required balance it can be sent to the game.

Whew.

much snippage above

The game I'm on is a MUSH (a talker) and so we don't have prompts. Nor
do we normally have to worry about things like ticks and timers.

The game I'm on has a sophisticated harvesting system to find, mine,
and sell crystal gemstones.
There are scripted actions that need to be performed in sequence and
some of the code objects I have to work with don't work with lightning
fast speed.

Earlier I needed to go: out,north,

then turn on a headlamp before walking into a "cave"

The command: /do_expand out,north,lamp on,cave

It didn't work out right as the game didn't process lamp on fast
enough for me to be able to get into the cave. Instead, I was blocked
saying the cave was too dark to enter (a locked door where the key is
a lit headlamp).

If I'd been able to send the commands with a one second pause between
I would have been able to enter the cave.

I believe MUSH has OUTPUTPREFIX and OUTPUTSUFFIX, which lets you attach
a prefix or suffix to the output of any command.  You can set those,
and watch for the suffix to know a command is done before sending the
next command.  The standard library file pcmd.tf has some macros to
help you do this.

What I have done for some combat routines is create a near-infinite
looping /repeat that looks at a variable, pops it off the list and
evaluates it. The /repeat rolls around again and goes through this
until the variable is empty at which point it terminates the /repeat.

How this code (which I use all the time) works is you append the
commands with /delay, if the wait_time variable is nonzero it starts
or continues the timed process. wait_time signifying how long between
each command in seconds.

/def delay =3D \
	/if ( wait_time !=3D 0 ) \
		/append delay_commands $[ textencode( {*} ) ] %; \
		/delay_ticker %; \
	/else \
		/eval %{*} %; \
	/endif

/def delay_ticker =3D \
	/if ( delay_process =3D=3D 0 ) \
		/repeat -%{wait_time} -n 5000 /delay_execute %; \
		/set delay_process %{?} %; \
	/endif

/def delay_execute =3D \
	/send $[ textdecode( $(/car %{delay_commands}) ) ] %; \
	/set delay_commands $(/cdr %{delay_commands})%;\
	/if ($(/length %{delay_commands})=3D=3D0) /delay_complete %; /endif

/def delay_complete =3D \
	/kill %{delay_process} %; \
	/unset delay_process

Hey everyone,

Any chance on gettting some help with this one? I think it was missed the
first time I sent it, because I sent it in a flurry of multiple questions.

% .tfrc, line 974: DEF -a: Invalid color value "Cbrightmagenta".  Valid

 are: black (0), red (1), green (2), yellow (3), blue (4), magenta (5), cyan

how do I set the basic colors as variable names? I tried them both as their
names and their names with a leading "C" (shown in one of the help files)
and neither works.

You have to use /eval to have tf expand variables where it normally
doesn't like variables.  So this macro works, with your color
substitutions...

/eval /def -mregexp -a%{CBorange} -t"gwen test" gwen_test =

I tested it by putting to party channel on the mud I play and it
lited it bright red, also checked other colors and it worked fine
with the /eval.  Altho, I did have to change the values for the
256 color portion to have Crgb515 (for example) instead of just
rgb515, to make the substitution consistent from 256 to 16 color.

Anyway, hope this helps.

I just wanted to take the time to thank folks on the list for all their
help the past few months.

My collection of macros for CrystalMUSH have really been growing and
improving.

This is a great list with a helpful collection of members.

What actually happens when Tinyfugue runs a shell command? SInce that's a
vague question...

Is the actual Tinyfugue client paused in some way, or is the real-time open
connection information still being monitored; even if I have a blank screen
waiting on the shell to finish?

Possible scenario:
I have two connections open in the same instance of Tinyfugue. In one, I'm
on CrystalMUSH flying my hovercraft around looking for valuable crystal
mines. In another, I am running one of my CrystalMUSH support people, I
have nothing to do, and I decide to run a /sh command and do something that
takes 10 minutes.

Is Tinyfugue still controlling my hovercraft in the background of the first
connection? Can my hovercraft crash and burn (I have macros set up that
should prevent that in pretty much all situations as long as Tinyfugue can
react to the incoming text)? What about my support person in the same
connection as the shell activity. Will Tinyfugue automatically respond to
triggers in that world?

I haven't tried it, yet. I thought I'd ask and find out if Tinyfugue is
actually paused/suspended, or if it's just the text on the screen that's
paused and Tinyfugue still processing things behind the scenes.

Gwen

AFAIK, when you /sh TF suspends in the background waiting on the /sh to exit.

Can my hovercraft crash and burn (I have macros set up that should prevent that in pretty much all situations as long as Tinyfugue can react to the incoming text)? What about my support person in the same connection as the shell activity. Will Tinyfugue automatically respond to triggers in that world?

Alright, 

I've reworked the code and gotten it to a point where I am pretty comfortable with the code (though there are things I still don't really like). Now I need a couple of people that aren't me to give it a whirl.

http://www.druware.com/private/tf.zip

This just a .zip and you can open it and run it from right there.  It will look for the tf-lib dir there and the .tfrc/tfrc file in your My Documents folder.  No environment variables should be needed.  What I need to know is what is broken, beyond what I think is broken.


As to what I think is broken:

* /sh, /sys, /quote will not function at all unless you also have a /bin/sh configuration set up (cygwin) and pipe limitations still prevent /quote from working even then
* /visual is a little jumpy
* /visual does not automatically refresh when you resize the window, it does on the next input/output
* /isize 1 does not work, but any size over 1 is fine
* there are some DEBUG: messages during startup showing where it is finding/setting things.

There is no installer yet, let's make sure it works first :-)

Dru.
