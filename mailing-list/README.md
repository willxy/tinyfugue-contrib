# TinyFugue mailing list archives

I've been unable to find downloadable original copies of the mailing list
archives.

archive.org does have some copies of http://tcp.com:80/pipermail/tinyfugue/
from 2002-2005, with some (but not all) of the threaded message files, but
it doesn't seem to have any of the actual mbox files:

 - https://web.archive.org/web/20051218102814/http://tcp.com:80/pipermail/tinyfugue/

So, here are the mbox files of the mailing list as received by me and saved
by procmail during 1996-2014.  

Note -- some of these files run as large as 3mb in size.
