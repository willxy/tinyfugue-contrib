I play, as I've said in the past, on CrystalMUSH, which is a game which has 
a strong "musical" theme.

One issue that plagues me is that I have to manage octave scales based on 
individual notes. Without getting into TOO much detail, an octave scale is 
a listing of 8 musical notes that are grouped together, and there are a 
total of 40 some-odd octave scales that I can make use of for game purposes.

My character, a Crystal Singer, finds veins of "crystal". Each vein is 
tuned to a specific note, which means I can use one of two very specific 
octave scales with it.

I have a command that grabs the "note" of any particular vein and uses /set 
to set the variable 'VEIN-SCALE' to a particular value. So, if the vein is 
'A flat', it sets VEIN-SCALE to 'Ab'. If it's A sharp, it sets VEIN-SCALE 
to 'As'. If it's A, it sets VEIN-SCALE to 'A'.

A sample octave scale:

do = C
re = D
fa = E
mi = F
so = G
la = A
ti = B
dx = C

What I cannot figure out is how to use the virtual array functions that 
have passed through this list (included at the bottom of this message), to 
set up something along these lines.

1) My pre-existing code would set the VEIN-SCALE to "C"

2) I would type "/note mi"

3) Array would look up the "mi" note of the "C" octave scale. It would 
ignore "Cs" and "Cb".

4) tf would respond with sending to the game:
set cutter to F
sing F

I know how to do the /send part of 4, what I don't know how to do is put 
the notes of each octave scale into the array and then grab individual 
notes out again as needed.

I hope this question makes sense. I'm not sure if I'm over- or under- 
explaining...

So, this being the C VEIN-SCALE, it would be initalized into the array
along these lines...

put_array("C","do","C")
put_array("C","re","D")
... et cetera ... (that is, name the array what's in VEIN-SCALE, the index
being do, re, me, et cetera, and the contents being the note...)

and then /note would use get_array(%VEIN-SCALE,%1) (or somethingish),
which would return the note (in your example, F); it could then use that
value to send along.  Say, something like...

/def note=/test send(strcat("set cutter to ", \
  get_array(%VEIN-SCALE,%1)),"Crystal")%;/test send(strcat("sing ", \
  get_array(%VEIN-SCALE,%1)),"Crystal")

(entirely untested; YMMV, let the buyer beware, but it looks about right;
there may be prettier ways to do it) which merely does as I said, using
get_array on the carefully-named array- and element-names to get the right
note, and sending it straight through to the commands, assuming your
CrystalMUSH world name is Crystal.

Bah, I'm so horrible at explaining these things.  :)

It made sense to me.  I think.

My musical skills suck, so for the purposes of this example, I'm
declaring that to be the A sharp scale.  :^)

You can use the existing macros unmodified if you use the scale name as
the name of the array, or you can add a dimension, as described below.

> /def put_array = /if ({#}2) /set _%1_array_%2=%-3%; \
>          /else /unset _%1_array_%2%; /endif

You're missing a greater-than sign: ({#}>2)

Try this, which uses VEINSCALE as the variable and one array, "cutter",
which has two dimensions.  The key point is that the /get_array2 returns
a value, which is then in %?, but commands which return a value will
change that, so you need to store the value.  /let defines a new
variable, with local scope, so it's only visible within the function.


/def get_array2 = /return _%1_array_%2_%3
/def put_array2 = /if ({#}>3) /set _%1_array_%2_%3=%-3%; \
	/else /unset _%1_array_%2_%3%; /endif
/def purge_array = /quote -S /unset `/listvar -s _%1_array_*
/def list_array = /listvar _%1_array_*

/def note = /get_array2 cutter %{VEINSCALE} %1%; /let note=%?%; \
	/send set cutter to %{note}%;/send sing %{note}

/put_array2 cutter As do C
/put_array2 cutter As re D
/put_array2 cutter As fa E
/put_array2 cutter As mi F
/put_array2 cutter As so G
/put_array2 cutter As la A
/put_array2 cutter As ti B
/put_array2 cutter As dx C


Is this what you wanted?

do = C

mi = F
so = G
la = A
ti = B
dx = C

2) I would type "/note mi"

3) Array would look up the "mi" note of the "C" octave scale. It would 
ignore "Cs" and "Cb".

4) tf would respond with sending to the game:
set cutter to F
sing F

====================================
how it works.

/def setup_mi = \
  /iinit_note mi
  /set_note mi set cutter to F
  /set_note mi sing F

typing: /play_note mi
will send to the mud "set cutter to F" and "sing F"

I didn't test this so there may be mistakes.

	I recently (for long, complicated reasons) had to switch from
old-school unix mbox mail spools to Qmail-style Maildir mailspools. It's
rather like the old old mh mail spool format, where each message has its
own file in a special directory, but done differently.

	However, it looks like 4.0s1 only wants to check when an mbox
file was last modified. Are there any patches out there for it to monitor
mtime on Maildir files instead?

	Thanks in advance!

I'm hoping this actually gets to the mailing list.  There was no help on how I'd communicate with the list from Majordomo, nor in the help text.  Sigh.

I'd like to be able to up/down to scroll through the command history, so I can edit it at will.  I know there are history searching commands, but nothing quite like this.

I'd also like to ctrl-left/right to hop left/right a word.

Do these functions exist?  I looked through the help texts and nothing jumped out at me..

Name          Default binding   Function
----          ---------------   --------

RECALLB       ^P                Recall previous input line
RECALLF       ^N                Recall next input line
WLEFT         ^B                Go left, to beginning of word
WRIGHT        ^F                Go right, to end of word

to bind these to something else use something like:
/def -b'=1BOA' bind_up_arrow =3D /dokey RECALLB

I don't know about the documentation, but when I press control-b, it goes
back a word.  When I press control-f, it goes forward a word.  I have also
been able to remap keys based on TinyFugue's documentation.

I recommend /require kb-bash.tf, which will be default keybindings in tf5.0
and are much more sane/consistent than the older tf default bindings.

Now what I'd like is a function that takes the current line and stuffs it
into the command history without sending it. So that, for example, if you
are typing up a long description of something and then someone pages you
and wants a quick reply. I want to be able to stuff the current line into
history, and then recall it, but not send it.

What would you prefer?  You can always define your own set of keybindings
that are more similar to what you're used to... (and release them to the
world for others to share as well!) :)

I understand there is even more customizability coming in 5.0, but that's
assuming we ever see it in this decade. :)

/recordline -i
see /help recordline

There's also kb-stack.tf which may be interesting to you, which lets you
push partial lines into a stack and pull them back later.

I also have a send hook on line starting with `-' which just echos them
to my screen instead of sending them to the mud, and then I can ^P back
to them and edit them later.

This is almost what I was looking for.

A sane default would include:

esc		- clear the line
ctrl left/right	- hop words
<partial text> & up/down - find the previous occurrances that fit the partial match

standard highlighting:
shift-right/left, home/end ctrl/left-right


I'm going to have to wait until the next revision of the program before I make another pass at this.  Until then, I've got mmucl working well enough.

Something like that.  In case I was too obtuse, that wasn't Santa in the
"oh goody presents" sense, it was in the "UFOs and Elvis sightings" sense.

If you use /log -g
then just try:

/def log_timestamp = \
	/if (world_info()!~"") \
	   /echo -ag $[ftime("[%x %X]",time())]%;\
	/endif%;\
	/repeat -01:00:00 1 /log_timestamp


call once per /log_timestamp

it checks if youre connected (if not timestamps are (imho) not useful)
then echoes the timestampt _gagged_ (nothing to be seen)
and calls itself in one hour

not see it on the screen?

As a work-around you could write a small shell script and cron it, which
appand a line to a temporary file when you got new mail in your
maildir...

You could set this temporary file in this var as your mail-file

	He's right. TFMAILPATH seemed to be to provide a list of
files (not dirs) to check according to the help, and setting $MAIL 
made tf complain "But ~/Maildir is a directory!" on startup (which is why
you say not to use that, of course).

Set the variable TFMAILPATH to a list of files for tf to check.
See "/help mail" (not "/help MAIL").

Unfortunately, this doesn't do any good with Maildirs. Specifically, they
are constructed in the following manner:

<dir>/new/<file> - unread messages, 1 per file
<dir>/cur/<file> - read messages, 1 per file
<dir>/tmp/<file> - working area, 1 message per file

Thus, the only obvious way to check for it is to check the mtime on the
"new" directory.

I'm new to this list and haven't managed to find any clues elsewhere (docs and altavista searches included), so please bare with me if this has been discussed before.

I'm trying to get some public channels hilited and have managed to do it half way.
The output from the mud will look something like:
Foo asks 'bar'  or  Foo ask 'bar' (depending on who is asking).

My trigger looks like:
/def -PCred -mregexp -t'[A-z]*\ ask.*'

The weird thing is that the triggers seems to work at least somewhat, the output is indeed affected but it's white. If I instead use the emote command (like the irc /me) to emulate a question it works like a charm and the output is coloured red.

What am I missing here? And is there any way to make sure it doesn't trigger on just any occurance of the word "ask"? If for instance someone would say "you could try asking blabla" in a tell I wouldn't like the trigger to set off. Using a leading "^" renders the trigger useless in my attempts to make it work :(

Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Btw, Is there a mailing list archive anywhere?

   How to set a value for a variable on tf startup? I tried using the -c
option when launching the program, but the command is executed only after
the .tfrc-file is executed and I need it right there. Value of this variable
changes by time and I don't want to include it in any file but type it
every time when launching tf.

At the very begging of your .tfrc-file put in
/set <variable name> value
This will set the variable before anything else gets started.
if you need to have spaces in your variable like "    start here" then do
/set <var>=   start here, and the spaces before start will be included.

You could put the value in an environment variable, and then tf
will see it before .tfrc runs.

You can use shell variables using set or export.
For example, if you are using bash, something like

export name=nobody
tf

should work.

I think I found the problem. The trigger was ok all along, it's just that the mud runs in ANSI mode and it seems that messes things up when I try to colourize yet again :P
Setting emulation to raw solves the colour problem, but then I get strange chars here and there.

Is there a way to "nullify" the ansi colouring on the incoming text that sets off the trigger before hiliting it? I really don't want to turn off ansi colours on the mud and paint the world manually, and I do need those hilites...

Any hints on this, and also how to tune the trigger not to react on words in the middle of a sentance would make me so happy :)

Thanks,

Penty

Hello Tuukka (Yo alltherest),
I might go wrong, but if you are using a common "bash" a possible way 
to solve your problem should be using a bash environment variable.

e.g. start your tf like:

TFOPT=xxx tf

So, just for the command "tf" TFOPT is set to xxx. In your .tfrc you
now may create bears or anything else you probably want in the first 
line...  like

/eval /run_very_important_script_creating_bears %TFOPT

Adrian

PS: Of course, 'FOO=bar echo $FOO' will not show any effect, because
    the running shell (and not the echo command) interprets $FOO.

Hmm you could also let the .tfrc file read the value from std-input

just include a:
/test echo("Input Value:"),tfread(TFOPT)
at the beginning of your .tfrc

Use /test, for example
/test a:="hello "

(/set and /let will cut off the trailing space, so a follwing
/let b=%a
would give "hello" to b, not "hello ".)

Hello.

I'm missing native mccp support among other things in version 4.0s1. Just
want to know if there are plans for a new version at all. Last one came
out -99 and thats quite a while ago. :-)

I never posted this script here, but I wanted to warn anybody who may
have downloaded my "urlgrab.tf" script that older versions have a
vulnerability.

URLs with the right characters in them would execute shell commands when
you used the /urlview command.  A (hopefully) fixed version is available
here:

Another way of doing this, other than quoting every special character
the shell cares about, would be to setenv URL, and then call:
%URL_Viewer %-L "\$URL"

Thats the one I'm using right now. :-)

The question was really if there is a new tf version coming at all.

   I have troubles getting the values passed to function while in
subscope (for-loop's) of the function. I know how handle passed variables
otherways but how to call them in new scope's if-command? The code below
doesn't work... so what must I change in /if ({1}=~"p") blah blah?

-- code --
/def testing = \
  /for y 0 1 \
    /if ({1}=~"p") /echo if this text is seen the function works%%;/endif

/testing p
-- end --

Can't figure it out with help files :(

Using /while instead of /for would solve this problem, since it executes
in the same scope. I assume that /while is more efficient than /for.
I know this doesn't answer the question but it solves the problem.

My understanding with /for loops is they can only do ONE command, they 
rather suck.  I use /while instead.


/def testing = \
  /test y := 0 %;\
  /while (y <= 1) \
    /if ({1} =~ "p") \
      /echo if this text is seen the function works %;\
    /endif %;\
    /test ++y %;\
  /DONE 

Also you don't need %% only need that if you're  /def'ing inside a def.

/for actually just uses /while.. and also a /eval which causes all the
variables to be expanded right away, not inside the loop. You'd have to
use for %%foo instead of just %foo to make it work. Use /while instead of
/for in macros, /for is good for command line stuff.

/list -i for
% 20: /def -i for = /@eval /let %1=%2%%; /while ( %1 <= %3 ) %-3%%; /@test ++%1%%; /done

in theory it could be possible to use my msp patch on windows ported tf code
and then use the windows compiled esd, i know the windows version of esd works
because i was playing with it couple weeks ago connecting to it from my linux
machine and stuff, though it was little sluggish over my 10MB/s network :)

I don't have windows C compiler and i never had the desire to write anything
for windows, so i can't really say for sure if it will work or not :)

I'm trying to get my hands on the TF 40g1 binary file
for Windows.

I had it archived in my records, but, I recently
discovered my file was bad, *and* the cd I had it
backed up to went "missing".

Does anyone out there have a copy? I don't need the
windows extensions, although, if you have one with
those, that's fine.

I realize s1 is the standard, I want g1 specifically
:).

Thanks,
Gwen

/def testing =3D /for y 0 1 /if ("%{1}" =3D~ "p") /echo foo %%; /endif

Read "/help for" carefully, and note that ``{1}'' on its own is the
first parameter of the ``for'' command, in this case ``y''.  You need to
escape the % stuff.  But because ``%{1}'' causes warnings in an
expression, ``%%{1}'' will cause warnings too.  I'm not sure why
``%{1}'' on its own doesn't work.  Something strange causes it to
disappear from visibility when there isn't a first parameter.

But "%{1}" works.  :^)

So it tends to do... I never tried adding quotation marks around %{1}.
Thanks for solution.. then again, someone said that /while should be used
instead of /for. Why so? It in some cases requires less code and can't eat
more cpu and mem than while.

Less code doesn't mean more efficiency. I just testet the execution time
of a /for-loop and a /while-loop. In my tests /while was up to 30% faster
than /for, and since /for executes in a new scope, it probably uses even
more memory. (And the new scope of /for can lead to errors, as we have
seen. :-))

Hope to be helpful,
Martin

Hmm, seems like I was wrong... and you used the way below?

/test y:=0

/while (y<=1) \
  /echo do everything%;\
  /test ++y%;\
/done

With /for this would be:

/for y 0 1 /echo do everything

...quite a lot shorter.

For speed comparison I used

/def loop1 = \
  /for i 1 10 /nop

/def loop2 = \
  /let i=0%;\
  /while (++i < 11) \
    /nop%;\
  /done

/def nop = /test 0

(Using /echo in a benchmark loop is probably not a good idea.)
But if your loop goes only from 0 to 1, the best thing would be to use
no loop at all. :-)

If you are still dubious about the efficiency of /while, have a look at

/list -i /for

/for actually uses /while, as was mentioned before in this thread.

Hope to be helpful.

But if you do real world stuff within the for it gets so screwed almost no
one is able to figure out what it does.

E.g.

/def = testfor \
	/for y 0 10 \
	/let x=%%y%%;\
	/let z=$$[x*x]%%;\
	/for a 0 4 \
	/let b=%%%z%%%;\
	/let b=$$$[b*2]%%%;\
	/echo %%%a %%%b %%%x %%%z%%%;

is it this what you call a clean code ??

i like this more (only stupid thing is setting the variables to one less
than the start condition as tf doesn't support x++ only ++x)

/def = testwhile \
	/let y=-1%;\
	/while (++y<=10) \
	/let x=%y%;\
	/let z=$[x*x]%;\
	/let a=-1%;\
	  /while (++a<=4) \
	     /let b=%z%;\
	     /let b=$[2*b]%;\
	     /echo %a %b %x %z%;\
  	  /done%;\
	/done%;

I have the following trigger

/def -p10 -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill \* Jerrin S\'reedith'
jerrinSreedithcataclysm= /echo -aBCyellow \(Cataclysm\)

so that I can see what area a mob is in.  But it fails on occasion.

cpc
You still have to kill * an elven citizen (The Forest).
You still have to kill * Jerrin S'reedith (The Ritual Staging Grounds).
You still have to kill * the lost orc (A warm passage).
You still have to kill * the armorsmith (Armoury).
You have 7 hrs and 11 mins left to finish this campaign.

cpc
You still have to kill * an elven citizen (The Forest).
(Cataclysm)
You still have to kill * Jerrin S'reedith (The Ritual Staging Grounds).
You still have to kill * the lost orc (A warm passage).
You still have to kill * the armorsmith (Armoury).
You have 7 hrs and 11 mins left to finish this campaign.

I have a lot of these and they all seem to fail and work when they want
to.  I set it to -p10 for high priority.
I am thinking that this might have something to do with it:
/hilite *Jerrin S'reedith*

I have the hilite for those that i dont know the area to yet so that i
can look it up with a mud command.

help?

Hello,

At the moment, I am using the world-q.tf macros, so that when
the message "% Activity in world foobar" I can type ESC-w and
give that world the focus.

So, my question is, how can I write a macro which automatically
brings a world with unread output to the front, also suppressing
the "% Activity in world foobar" output (which would then be
unnecessary)?

Many thanks,
Ian

/def -h'ACTIVITY *' -agG auto_switch_worlds = /fg %1

But you may not want to do this if you actually send text to any
of the worlds, since it might switch on you just as you were going to
press return and you'd send to the wrong place.

Hello everyone, Im new to Tf and I need some basic help.
(Yes, I read the manual:)
Im trying to make a hook that will allow me to target a mob or player
and put its name in a varible called "target."  So, when I type "T rat"
rat will go into my target variable.  I tried doing it like this...
/hook send t * = /set t=target{2}

This did not work for me.
Does anyone know how to make this work?
ALso, would setting it up with the /def -h ....... style make it faster
or more economical?

Thanks for your help!

Chris

If it were me,  I'ld do something like:
	/alias T /set target=%1

Unless of course you are planning on typing T by itself alot.  8o)

/def -mglob -p1 -h'SEND {t}*' set_target = /set target %L1

Untested, but it's a modified version of something I already have.  So in a
perfect world it SHOULD work.

From a usability standpoint, it might be better to have a more descriptive
command than just 't'.  I personally would use the full word 'target'.  But
hey, whatever you'll use, right?

In general, you probably don't want to put -i on macros/triggers like
this.  -i should generally be used by libraries for their "internal"
macros/functions that users shouldn't directly call.

Some of this has been covered in other replies to this thread, but I'll
repeat for clarity, and add some new information.

That {1} is evaluated in the scope of the /for, so it has the value of
the first argument to /for, which is "y".  Similarly, %%{1} would be
substituted in the scope of the /for, so it would also have the value "y".

If you do this:

    /def testing = \
      /for y 0 1 \
        /if (%{1}=~"p") /echo it works%%; /endif

then the %{1} is substituted when /testing is expanded, so typing

    /testing p

is equivalent to typing

    /for y 0 1 /if (p=~"p") /echo it works%; /endif

Then the if compares the variable p to the string "p", which is not what
you want.  An "obvious" solution is to put quotes around the %{1},

    /def testing = \
      /for y 0 1 \
        /if ("%{1}"=~"p") \
	  /echo it works%%; \
	/endif

so that when you type

    /testing p

it expands to

    /for y 0 1 /if ("p"=~"p") /echo it works%; /endif

But this is still not quite right:  consider

    /testing foo"bar

which expands to

    /for y 0 1 /if ("foo"bar"=~"p") /echo it works%; /endif

which is a syntax error.  (You can imagine other arguments that would
result in valid syntax with undesirable effects.)  What you really want
is to make /testing's {1} available to /for, via an expression value,
not a % text expansion.  Since you can not do this directly, you must
do it with a variable:

    /def testing = \
      /let arg=%1%; \
      /for y 0 1 \
        /if (arg=~"p") \
	  /echo it works%%; \
	/endif

This does exactly what you want.  Of course, /for is just a macro that
uses /while, so you can avoid the confusing second level of expansion,
and run more efficiently, by writing your macro in terms of /while:

    /def testing = \
      /let y=0%; \
      /while (y <= 1) \
        /if ({1}=~"p") \
	  /echo it works%; \
	/endif%; \
	/test ++y%; \
      /done

It's more verbose, but can be easier to understand.

/for is mainly useful as a convenient shortcut for /while, when typing on
the command line or when the body of the loop is small.  In complex macros,
it's usually more clear to use /while.

Hello everyone and thanks for all the advice.
I have tried the options but I cannot get them to work correctly.
On this one...

/def -mglob -p1 -h'SEND {t}*' set_target =
/set target %L1

I am getting an invalid macro name error.  Changing the name, and
spacing around the '=', moving the {} from around the 't' to around
the'*' and generally trying to reformat it has all ended up with some
error or another.

Any ideas on how to fix this one?

Unless your mailer split the line for you when you posted, put it all on
one line, or at the end of the first line, put a \ to continue the macro
on the next line.

Does anybody know if there is a way to log the actual ANSI sequences so
that you can view your log files with the same colors that are output to
your screen?

This is the general rule for most mailing lists when you need
to contact a human.

 Here's the general information for the list you've subscribed to,
 in case you don't already have it:

The TinyFugue mailing list is for discussion of topics related to the
TinyFugue mud client, including macro/trigger programming techniques,
discussion of feature requests, announcements from the author, bug
reports, etc.  This is not a list for discussion of muds or mudding.

If you have a question, please do not post it to the list without
first reading the online "/help" or http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/help/.
If you don't take the time to read the documetation, why should I or
other readers take the time to answer your basic questions?

I monitor the list, but I do not promise to reply to every message.
Hopefully the readers of this list will be able to answer many of each
others' questions and give each other ideas.

Hi guys,

I have been reading through the /help files for the last two days, but I 
think my problem has more to do with my lack of knowledge on Internet 
technologies more than it has to do with learning how to work TF.  I used 
to use TF when I had access to a UNIX machine.  To make a long story short, 
I only have a win32 machine off which I can play.  No big deal.  Last week 
I learned that TF now has a win32 version.

I got it from druware.com.  To make a long story short, I can't get TF to 
/connect.  I can't even /telnet.
/connect 3k.org 5000 returns a Connection refused message.

I don't have a .tfrc file.
I am behind a cable router and it's built in firewall.
I can connect via telnet from the command prompt.
I was able to connect via another mud client (portal).
I was not able to connect via ZMUD.

Any ideas?

Until I get the druware site reestablished (I'll make an announcement about
it)  use the version that I did for WilburWare while I was there.
http://www.wilburware.net.  It has a newer build and installer that seems to
have less issues with Windows 9X machines.

If you continue to have problems with that build, you may want to see if you
can 'ping' your mud and see if you have connectivity.  This is not a sure
fire answer, but it's certainly a start.  It's possible that your router is
preventing access or using a proxy client for external access.

On that note, www.druware.com is being reworked and moved as we speak to a
new home and site as the merger of my projects into the other company simply
didn't work out.  So I'm back out on my own, (yes in this nasty ass
economy).  ;-).  My wife is less than thrilled, but I'm happy to be back at
the DruwWare thing.

Anyways, the TF work I did at WilburWare is coming to the DruWare installs,
and in addition I am bring back my OS/2, BeOS and now MacOS X installers to
the DruWare site.  I was hoping to hold of on the official announcement
until Feb. 1, and the launch is scheduled for Feb. 15.

Hello list(eners)... :)
Again I'm wondering about efficiency and computing time. Scanning
a Mud's who I want to extract everyone's player guild and level.
Therefore I made a long if-elseif-chain, approx. 40 /elsif's...
Searching alternatives (something like 'switch', but it would be
just another look-and-feel for the same problem) I thought ...

What about regmatching the players title (e.g. "Blademaster") in
a very long string, ... e.g.:

/let alltitles=... Moron warrior 1 Fumbler warrior 2 Ripper warrior 3 \
  ... Blademaster warrior 10 ... Grand Zombiemaster necromancer 8 ..%;\
/if ( regmatch(strcat(" ",title," (warrior|necromancer|paladin|cleric) \
      ([0-9]+) "),alltitles) == 1) \
    /let guild=%P1%;\
    /let level=%P2

(not tested and has surely to be made idiot-proof) -- Well, it will 
work, sure, but back to efficiency: Which is the better way?

If-Elseif-Chain or Regmatch-a-String?

As a general rule of thumb, anything done in the tf "kernel" will be faster
than anything done in the tf language.  The rule holds in this case, so it's
faster to put the "switch" in a regexp (in-kernel) instead of a series of
/ifs.  However, a still faster solution would be define a macro for each
title, and take advantage of tf's efficient macro lookup:

/def defguildlevel = /def gl_guild_%3_%4_%5=%1%; /def gl_level_%3_%4=%2

/purge gl_guild_*
/defguildlevel  warrior      1  Moron
/defguildlevel  warrior      2  Fumbler
/defguildlevel  warrior      3  Ripper
...
/defguildlevel  necromancer  8  Grand Zombiemaster
...

/def lookup_title = \
    /let title=%1_%2_%3%; \
    /let guild=${gl_guild_%title}%;\
    /let level=${gl_level_%title}%;\
    ...

In tf 5.0, the macro-lookup version is about twice as fast as the
regexp version.  However, the regexp and macro-lookup versions are both
so fast that you're not likely to notice the difference unless you're
doing thousands of lookups at a time; so, you should probably worry
more about ease of coding.  The macro-lookup version wins again, since
it puts the list of titles in a nicely formatted table that's easy to
read and maintain.

A few notes:
* The title data are stored in macros instead of variables because
  ${gl_level_%title} is allowed but %{gl_level_%title} is not.
* The %3_%4_%5 in /defguildlevel and %1_%2_%3 in /lookup_title handles
  titles with up to 3 words.
* The /purge prevents a bunch of redef messages if you reload the file.
* In the regexp version, you used "/if (regmatch(...) == 1)".  You should
  get in the habit of using "/if (regmatch(...))", because in tf 5.0,
  regmatch() may return positive integers other than 1 for success.

Ken,

In the TinyFugue kernel, are you nullifying the effect of these ANSI codes
depending on where the output is going (screen vs. file vs. other pipe)?
If so, is it possible to deactivate this nullifying effect without
recompiling? ;)

Maybe I'm trying too hard to keep my pretty colors even after I log out.

 - Paul

What kind of firewall are you using again?  I know some windows firewalls
are set up to limit which applications can create outgoing connections/etc.
Perhaps you have an issue like this.

I made a macro that opens a file and echo's it to screen, but turning on 
/more on doesn't pause it.
How can I make this work ?

the macro is something like this

/test i = tfopen('file name here', 'r');
then a loop with /test tfread(i, st)
then /test echo(st)

using commands like that the macro does work it opens the file and reads 
line by line and echos each
line to screen no problem, just need a darn pause after 20 lines each time.

Thanks

This is using TF in windows XP.

In raw mode any ansi color that ends in 1m always comes out white, how 
can I fix this ?
Which makes no sense because when in ansi_attr mode all ansi codes from 
the mud work fine,
how can I make it so my ansi codes sent thru echo work fine ?

My guess <esc>1m = white and what is happening is TF is skipping past 
the ';'
so a hired <ESC>[31;1m is being turned into <esc>1m

I did some experiementing in debug mode, seems echo does not go thru the 
same way data coming from
the mud does.  I tried displaying an ansi string, and the codes didn't 
get turned into "^" for escs like they do
coming from the mud.  So how do I get TF to process codes ?

I figured it out a code like <ESC>[34;1m has to be swaped around to 
<esc>[1;34m

The mud I play on never sends esc codes like that, but it serves the 
purpse of being able to display color
from my macro.

I have a macro that open a file and displays it different colors, I have 
noticed the last 5 lines in my file are color.
The macro does a /set emulation=raw at the start and a /set 
emulation=ansi_attr

Now if I remover the /set emulation=ansi_attr the whole file will be in 
color.

It seems the macro ends before all the data has been passed to the screen.

How can I make it so the macro waits until all the data has been 
displated to the screen ?

Seems /more on then caling more color function makes the color turn into 
raw ansi codes instead of color.

What I really need to do is make my own more, I tried this but wasnt 
able to get it to work.

In the loop I need it to ask the user to press return to continue,  All 
this should take is reading the keyboard for return,
then contining the loop.  There must be a way to do it.

I wanted to keep track of the amount that people from my particular
group donated.

For the background, my MUD has Clans.  My Clan has families (my family
is the sedrinpani thing).  I want to see how my family is donating to
the Clan.

I used this:

/def -mregexp -t'^CLAN ANNOUNCEMENT: Vitae has donated ([0-9]+) gold to
the clan.' sedrinpani=/set sedrinpani_count $[{sedrinpani_count}+{P1}]

1)
The mud sends donations like this:
CLAN ANNOUNCEMENT: Vitae has donated 2,000 gold to the clan.
The , throws it off.  It works fine if only 1 - 999 gold is donated, i
tested that, but if 1,000 or more is donated then the , screws it.

2)
How do i put more than one person in there?  
I tried:
[Vitae|2nd person|3rd person|etc]
%[Vitae|2nd person|3rd person|etc]
$[Vitae|2nd person|3rd person|etc]
and
{Vitae|2nd person|3rd person|etc}
%{Vitae|2nd person|3rd person|etc}
${Vitae|2nd person|3rd person|etc}


As always, thank you for any help.

Match ([0-9,]+)

And then use replace(",", "", {P2}) or whatever to remove the commas.

wait, I THINK i got it to work....it looks messy as hell tho:
/def -mregexp -t'^CLAN ANNOUNCEMENT: (Vitae|Garren) has donated
([0-9,]+) gold to the clan.' sedrinpani=/set
sedrinpanidonations=$[replace(",", "", {P2})]%;/set sedrinpani_count
$[{sedrinpani_count}+{sedrinpanidonations}]

it works, but not sure if this is the way that you were thinking of :-)

Try
/def -mregexp -t'^CLAN ANNOUNCEMENT: (Vitae|2nd person|etc.) has donated
([0-9]+,)?([0-9]+) gold to the clan\\.$' sedrinpani =
    /set sedrinpani_count $[{sedrinpani_count}+{P2-0}*1000+{P3}]
 
Hope it helped.

/def -mregexp -t'^CLAN ANNOUNCEMENT: (Vitae|Garren) has donated ([0-9,]+) gold to the clan.' sedrinpani= \
    /test sedrinpani_count := sedrinpani_count + replace(",", "", {P2})

Which looks clean, and handles millions as well as thousands, etc.

Seems in some of my macros the value of the string causes run time errors.
for example if the string contains a '[' it can mess up the macro it 
shouldn't though.  The value of a variable shouldn't be getting 
substitited and it may be.

like in this /return sting_st

stirng_st shouldn't be getting substatuted if it is I need to know how I 
can fix that.

Do you have an example that actually breaks?
/def foo =\
    /let x=%;\
    /test x:="[abc]"%;\
    /return x

/expr foo()

works for me.

try this:

/test foo('\'')

It's in the /test line... Use
  /test foo ('\\')

instead.  The extra slash means to do a literal slash rather than
escaping the '.

In this case, it is because the backslash escapes the last quote. This
is how you write a string if you want a quote in it. To get a backslash
in the string, you need to escape it:

/test foo('\\')

Damn, hit a snag with this...

These are my codes:
;Catches the donations from the people that are in my group and writes
the amount to vitaevars.tf
/def -mregexp -t'^CLAN ANNOUNCEMENT: (Vitae|Garren|Duhe|Panda|Tyris) has
donated ([0-9,]+) gold to the clan.' sedrinpani= \
  /test sedrinpani_count := sedrinpani_count + replace(",", "",
{P2})%;/vitaevar
;does the writing
/def vitaevar = /listvar *_count %| /writefile vitaevars.tf

;displays the amount
/def stats = \
  /test echo(pad("Sedrin Pan'i",17,"",3,sedrinpani_count,25))

;I do this 4 times and it type /stats to see the result and its fine:
/repeat 50 /trigger CLAN ANNOUNCEMENT: Vitae has donated 10,000,000 gold
to the clan.
Sedrin Pan'i                  2000000000

;I run it again for the heck of it this time with /stats cause I am
bored:
/repeat 50 /trigger CLAN ANNOUNCEMENT: Vitae has donated 10,000,000 gold
to the clan.%;/stats
...
Sedrin Pan'i                  2120000000
Sedrin Pan'i                  2130000000
Sedrin Pan'i                  2140000000
Sedrin Pan'i                 -2144967296
Sedrin Pan'i                 -2134967296
Sedrin Pan'i                 -2124967296

????....it went negative and started counting down........
I know, donating 2 billion will take a LOOOOOOOOONG time, but i plan in
having this for a LOOOOOONG time :-)

I tried it again to see if maybe showing the stats each time was the
reason for the error...NOPE...happened again.
Even did:
/trigger CLAN ANNOUNCEMENT: Vitae has donated 2,140,000,000 gold to the
clan.

and it was fine.  then did:

/trigger CLAN ANNOUNCEMENT: Vitae has donated 10,000,000 gold to the
clan.

and it said the same thing:
Sedrin Pan'i                 -2144967296

Any ideas?

While at it...anyway that it could display the , to seperate it into
hundreds in the var like:
Sedrin Pan'i                  2,120,000,000
Sedrin Pan'i                  2,130,000,000
Sedrin Pan'i                  2,140,000,000

If you force it to use floating point it won't wrap, it's because you
wrapped a 32 bit integer.

Something like /test sedrinpani_count := 0.0 + sedrinpani_count + replace(",", "", {P@})

You're run into the limititation of 32-bit integers. THe maximum value for 
a signed 32-bit integer is 2147483647, if you try and increment that by 
one, you'll either get a OverFlow exception, or it'll 'wrap around' to the 
lowest negative number, which is -2147483648.


Solution: Don't Do That, Then.

TF does arithmetic as a 32 bit signed integer, with a maximum value of
2^31, roughly 2 billion.  If you need bigger numbers, you need to look
in to arbitrary precision arithmetic.  Floating point numbers will do
you no good, here, since you will lose precision as the total grows
larger.

  That's fine and all but my functions are far more complexed, and I am 
processing a lot of data from a disk file.
I rather not have to look at every character in the disk file for 
special characters.

If a line in the disk file has '\' or other TF special characters I 
don't want them to mess things up.
So if I change say '\' in the disk file to \' or \\ It won't do.

There must be a way to return a string regardless of what's inside of it.

I thin what's happening here is the "return x" is getting turned into 
"return \" so it's subsituting before the return.

The problem with your example had nothing to do with the /return.
It was because you called a /test with an invalid string.

tf 4.0s1 doesn't seem to send the window size info (lines, columns) to the
mud as it changes, only when connecting, when changing visual mode, or
when the mud asks for it (IAC DO NAWS)..

My mud's line wrapping and page sizes for more depend on the line and
column info sent by the client, so I added a transmit_window_size() call
to get_window_size() in src/tty.c.

The small patch that does this is at the end of the mail for any who might
need it..

I made my first foray into customizing the status
field by changing the time to include the date.

I also updated from 4.0 g1 to 4.0 s1 (Windows compile,
with the Windows extensions).

Under 4.0g1, it showed the date in the status bar
immediately upon loading. The s1 compile only shows it
after the first time the system clock rolls over from
one minute to the next.

So, if I load tf at 12:30:02, it won't show the date
for almost a whole minute.

While this doens't "break" anything, I find it
annoying, and I was wondering if I had to "live with
it", or, if it could be fixed it in some way :).

Custom configuration of the status bar included below
(in case something I did matters)

I've been working on /quote macros to make my MU life

Here is the first way. It works:

/def pray = \
 /quote -w${world_name} -30 pose `/%{1}

;;; prayer 1 Baby Blessing

/def jamra1 = \
/echo chants in a sing-song tone reminiscent of
storytelling. "Wisdom of serpent be thine, Wisdom of
raven be thine, Wisdom of valiant eagle."  %;\
/echo continues "Voice of swan be thine, Voice of
honey be thine, Voice of the Son of the stars." %;\
/echo finishes "Bounty of sea be thine, Bounty of land
be thine, Bounty of the Creator of all."

I type "/pray jamra1" and the prayer is posed to the
MUSH location one 'echo' line at a time, with a delay
of 30 seconds between each line.

Building from there, I was hoping to do a mix of
commands.

/def cut = \
    /quote -w${world_name} -10 `/%{1} %;\

/def five-chord =\
/note do %;\
/send cut %{shape} size=%{size} %;\
/note mi %;\
/send cut %{shape} size=%{size} %;\
/note la %;\
/send cut %{shape} size=%{size} %;\
/note dx %;\
/send cut %{shape} size=%{size} %;\
/note ti %;\
/send cut %{shape} size=%{size} %;\

With this one, when I type "/cut five-chord", I would
want to send each line of the five-chord macro to the
mush, with a delay of 10 seconds between each.

Instead, it sends all lines as a single block of
commands. Everything evaluates properly, it just isn't
delaying.

Any suggestions?

Gwen

Last question for the night...

I'm trying to set an /if-else switch so that if I type
"/note2 do" or "note2 re" or "/note2 so" (or one of
the other items in the list (the list being do, re,
mi, fa, so, la, ti, dx)), it runs the if part of the
macro.

If I don't type one of the items in the list , then,
it drops down and runs the else part of the macro.

From "help expressions", I *thought* I got that I
could use a list of "or" items, by seperating them
with pipe (1|or 2|or 3|etc), but, this is not working
in the below macro.

/def note2 = \
  /if ({*} =~"do|re|mi|fa|la|so|ti|dx") \
       /get_array %{VEINSCALE} %1%; /let note=%? %;\
       /_echo %;/send pose tunes a "%1" note. %;/send
set cutter to %{note} %;/send sing %{note} %;\
  /else \
       /send -w'ss' set cutter to %* %;\
       /send -w'ss' sing %* %;\
  /endif

What happens is it seems to automatically evaluate the
'else', no matter what I type, leading me to assume I
configured the 'if' part improperly.

  s =~ t  String equality (case sensitive).  
  s =/ t  String s matches glob pattern t.  

You want =/.  Otherwise it matches the entire string.

One uses /echo, the other /send.  /send sends the text immediately.

/quote takes text which would go to your screen and then sends that
to the mud, so you want /echo.

You may also want /quote -w with your quotes to make sure they
keep going to the world you start them on, if you use multiple
muds at the same time.

The mud that I play has different codes for different locations of
items/text. on the main window you can have everything, but there are
things like thoughts that on the "official" client have their own
windows so that you can see thought conversation in a separate location
than that of regular conversation. My question is in relation to the
screen, could I somehow devote the top 10% of the tf screen to a
separate set of text and how would I sort the text so that only text
that matched a certain regex went to the window? does this make sense to
anyone sel? If you play DragonRealms you know what I am taling about.
For that matter, if you play DR, I'd like to hear from you to compile
scripts and whatnot and maybe setup a DR tinyfugue library. Thanks.

Except the statusline there are no separate areas to be filled with text
in tf.
Many people use separate worlds to store redirected text and switch
between the worlds as they need.

I prefer directing the text matched by the triggers to a file and showing
it in separate xterms by
xterm -e -t"%name" "tail -f %name.log"

Hope it helps.

To extend tf to display such an separate text area would require
modifications of the tf-sources.

   Hello all,
  I cannot key some keybindings to work.  
  Here is what I have:
     /def -B'HOME' homekey = action here
Now whenever I push the homekey it moves the cursor back to the
beginning of the line.  How do I get this to work?
ps, I tried replaceing the HOME with ^A but it didnt work.

In most terminals you can type CTRL-V followed by the key you want to 
print. CTRL-V removes any special meaning, So you can try to see what 
your terminal uses as code for Home-Key by trying:

CRTL-V HOME-Key

At least this works with my xterm...

Hope this helps

Let's say I have a function which I call

/test tfunc("begin","text1","text2","text3")
/test tfunc("begin","text1","text2")

so that's with varying number of "text"s.

when I, in that function, want to pass the text variables to a new
sub-function, I need to do this:

/test t2func({2},{3},{4})
/test t2func({2},{3})

depending on the amount of variables I gave to first main function, which
I don't know because it varies. Is there a way to give all the variables
but the first at the same time, would possibly look something like this:

/test t2func({2,*})

you get the idea.

Of course I could do just one function to create array variables from
given values "text1","text2" and "text3" and after that call the new
function with the array's name, like text_str[1-3] (text_str1, text_str2
and text_str3), but this wouldn't serve the way I want to go so I need
other way.

---

In addition, one other problem:
If I created the function to create arrays from given values, I would
always give varying amount of variables:

/test create_array("_temp_variable","text1","text2","text3")

Let's say tfunc looks like this:

/def -i create_array = \
 /let x=1%;\
 /while (++x <= 10) \
  /eval /set %{1}$[x-1]=%%{%{x}}%;\
 /done

this would create variables called _temp_variable1, _temp_variable2 and
_temp_variable3 with values of "text1", "text2" and "text3" which is
exactly what I want. But in addition to this the loop also creates empty
variables from _temp_variable4 to _temp_variable9 which I don't need. So
there's some needless looping around. How to know how many variables were
passed to function?

Then with this code there's also the line:

  /eval /set %{1}$[x-1]=%%{%{x}}%;\

which looks pretty much confusing. Is there any other way to carry this
out?

Furthermore, when such code needs more evaluation it looks just terrible
like:

...
  /eval /eval /eval /echo \
	$$$$[strcat("%{1}","$$$[strlen(%%{%{x}})-1]"," %%{%{x}}")]%;\
...

or something like that (wouldn't work I guess). Using temporary variables
is the only solution?

For TF5, can /quote be made to, either by flag or default, substitute %b or
some use-definable character, for spaces, for when we want to paste 
formatted text to a MUSH, which makes multi-space things one space?

/def mush_quoted_send =\
    /send $[replace(" ", "\%b", {*})]

/quote -0 /mush_quoted_send 'file

or something similar should work.

I have so far refrained from asking when version 5 of tinyfugue is
coming out because I'm sure Ken deals with such questions all the time.
However, I've wanted to play with the source of tinyfugue to make
changes such as using the pcre library for regular expressions, which is
just enough work for someone with my meagre skills that I'm wondering
if I shouldn't wait until version 5 so I can see what new goodies are
included.

So I'm wondering if anonymous CVS access to the new version's source is
a possibility. It seems to be all the rage these days with sites like
Sourceforge and Savannah.

Since folks seem to be making requests, I'll throw mine in too...

Would it be possible to make it so connections can be opened to a null
world? It'd be useful for filtering stuff like chats
status and such...connect to a null world, set a trigger for the stuff
you want, and display it in the null world's window. It'd be really nice
if null worlds were /recallable and loggable too. }:) I know this can be
done by defining a new world using your localhost and the discard port,
but a lot of ISPs are blocking the discard port (with good reason). Or
maybe make it so worlds can be flagged so that when you do /saveworld,
flagged worlds are ignored...

I reply to myself (because no one else does :(

1) Special variable {#} has the number of variables given to function
2) I coded a function "ar_rest" that returns string consisting of {Lx}'s,
for example "{L3}, {L2}, {L1}". Then I call for example

/def -i ar_rest = \
  /let y=0%;\
    /set lst=%;\
    /while (++y <= {1}) \
      /eval /test lst:="$$[strcat(lst,"{L","$[{1}-y+1]","}, ")]"%;\
    /done%;\
    /set lst=$[substr(lst,0,strlen(lst)-2)]%;\
    /return lst

/def forwarding = \
  /test dowhatever($[ar_rest(({#}-1))])%;\

> /test forwarding("not continued", "first", "second", "third", "etc")

to give forward all the possible variable values but the first. This
looks a bit odd but it works.

I think
/test lst := strcat(lst, "{L", {1}-y+1], "}, ")
does the same thing, without an eval.

Yeah, this is a very nice way of doing it.

You're not the only one wanting null worlds. This would be divine.

If it's not way out there, it'd also be useful to run programs in a
tinyfugue world -- tf is a great wrapper for irc, micq and similar.
Keeping all of your live communication in one place is nice. But right
now, you've got to open a telnet world back to your machine to do it.

First, I wouldn't hold my breath too long waiting for TF5 if I were you.
I mean no offense to Ken, as he's given us a great tool here and he's
certainly under no obligation to continue working on it.  I just think
maybe we should be honest with ourselves here.  My personal mail archives
for this list go back just over a year, and my earliest thread in there 
about TF5 is from Jan 12th of 2000.  And 5 had already been underway for
some time at that point.  Over the last year, we've heard less and less 
about 5.0, which certainly doesn't spur optimism about it's release.

As far as CVS-type access, I can't find it in my personal archives, but
I'm almost certain it's been asked before, and Ken refused.  TF isn't
really a collaborative project, it's Ken's baby and as such he doesn't
make development versions available.  (I could be misrepresenting Ken's
position here, and if so I apologize, but I think I'm recalling the
information correctly)

I have rather wondered why the development of TF isn't more open, it
certainly would be nice if we could get a look in to what's going to
happen, so that Ken doesn't have to do all the work himself... or with
the help of the core team of developers. There certainly are at least
a few things on my want list, which I would be happy to try and help
contribute if need be. One of the things I'm most interested is the
general look and feel of the interface. I suppose the one interface
that I look at is that of ircII, which has fairly complete support for
scrolling back in to your history with page up and page down,
multiple  windows, fairly transparent switching between these windows,
rather easy manipulation of the status bars for each one, etc.

And, this is probably more of a taste thing, but I've always thought
that the scripting language was relatively difficult to read. I'm
wondering if there's any chance having a syntax which was more C,
Perl, Bourne, etc like with respect to functions within a braces, no
need for trailing \'s, or / at the beginning of each line. I do
realize rewriting the syntax for scripting is obviously not an easy
task, but it might be kind of nice to know what the chance of something
like that is of happening. Pluggable modules is also another option,
so one could do perl scripting within TF, for instance, which would be
a major gain in my mind.

I'd love to see perl powered scripts in TF - as it is I can just call them 
right now and return values, but thats ugly.  The drawback on adding perl 
calling capability is the sheer load time of perl.  Not huge, but enough to 
slow the client down when the output from a world is high.

One could bloat TF by making it load the perl interpreter one time if there 
are any references to the perl calls in any scripts/triggers.  Performance 
benefit vs memory usage.

It certainly would be handy. I'm not too sure how viable it is to do
it, however. I think it would certainly be easy to dynamically load it
if you don't need it, with some sort of loading function which could
dlopen a tf_perl.so or some such, a bit like how zsh handles its
modularization. If you don't tell it to load, it doesn't. This would
also help on those rare systems which don't have perl and simply
couldn't build this portion of TF.
I think the current interpretor that TF uses is powerful, but perl
sure would be nice... as it stands, I do execute an external perl
script to get logged in, for instance. Nice if this were all just
handily built in.

If you want a embedded scritping language, Python might be a better 
option. It was designed to be embedded/extended from the word go.

Well, depending upon how the work was done, in theory, any number of
languages could act as pluggable modules. As long as there was some
sort of standard API for plugging one of these things in, anyone could
write one for their language of choice, assuming they were prepared to
do up the work for all of the hooks and what not. Perl was the first
one that came to mind, because I know Perl a lot better than I know
Python (which still isn't all that much), and it wouldn't so much
replace the current TF scripting engine, just be an alternative to.

Personally, I think that the best way to include the functionality of an 
external scripting language is to write a glue which will allow 
mod_whatever plugins (Perl, Python, Ruby, TCL - heck, even C) to be loaded 
dynamically/compiled in at runtime/whatever.  I'd be most likely to use 
Perl and C plugins.  I have friends who swear by TCL.  I'm not 
language-biased - I think it should be possible to write things in 
whatever is most comfortable for you (with the possible requirement of 
writing your mod_whatever plugin yourself, but hey, with a nice glue, 
that's not hard!).

Just my two Hershebian half-Dongs...

Hi, everybody. I'm trying to use tf as a tool to automate the
configuring of an Alcatel router. The router listens on the
telnet port. I have managed to create hooks for the commands
I want, but the login is still eluding me.

The router sends the following prompts:

'User : '

'Password : '

I tried defining the world both as a LP and as a telnet world,
to no avail; tf does not send the username or the password.

From what I read in the docs, I believe that the autologin 
prompts may be redefined, but how do I do it? I couldn't
find any examples.

Thanks in advance for any help.

When setting new variables with /test tf always reports it has generated
one in global scope if the variable didn't exist before that. How to make
prevent this message from showing up or do I have to preset these
variables (which is hard and annoying when playing with arrays) ?

You may want to look in to using expect(1) to do that.

At the moment, I use expect to manage Alcatel OmniCore switches.  I
can't give out my scripts, but it's pretty easy to write.

A simpler version that still does what you want, I think:

; %1, %2 -- start and end of the argument range to echo
/def ar_range = \
        /let index=$[{1}-1]%; /while (++index < {2}) \
                /echo {%index},%; \
        /done%; \
        /echo {%index}

/def forwarding = \
    /test dowhatever($(/ar_range 2 %#))

/test forwarding("not continued", "first", "second", "third", "etc")

Command substitution pulls the lines together and this evaluates as:
/test dowhatever({2}, {3}, {4}, {5})

I mentioned the same thing in that thread I referred to a year ago and
acc to Ken it had already been done in TF5.  I would agree with the 
later posts in this thread however, that a pluggable api allowing 
for any language to be used is a much better solution.

Not that any of this really makes any difference unless Ken decides
he wants to change his development model.

Well, when I said pluggable, I thought it implied the ability to do
any language, as that is the major gain of the concept. I just picked
Perl off the top of my head, as I thought it would be the one that
would generate the most interest. Perl, Python, TCL, zsh scripting, C,
whatever anyone wants could be made to easily integrate.
Even the TF scripting language would be made to be a module in this
case, so you wouldn't need to load it unless you wanted to. Obviously
there'd be a need for some basic syntax functions to support the
loading of such modules, but aside from that, pick the one you want
and that's the only executable bloat you ought to see.

Hi,

there are three ways of preventing this:

first: define the variable in the global scope first:
e.g. /set x=%;/test x:=extreme_expression

second: /set pedantic=off stops many warnings (not recommended in debug
mode :)

third: comment the line in tfio.c and rebuild tf

Have Fun,

Michael

I'm trying to write a "work queue" of actions that I want
to perform on the mud.

What I have working so far is this:

    /def work_item_1 = say hi there nox
    /def work_item_2 = smile nox
    /def work_item_3 = thank nox

    /enqueue work_item_1 workqueue
    /enqueue work_item_2 workqueue
    /enqueue work_item_3 workqueue

    /def do_work = /$(/dequeue work)

Now, I can type /do_work, and it will do whatever is to be done next.

However, it's rather tedious to create a unique one word name for
each work item.  I'd rather just use the macro numebrs and have
anonymous macros (since I don't need them for anything anyways).
Actally, ideally I'd like the work_queue to be able to support 
phrases, but I know the stack-q.tf implementation doesn't do that.

Now, here's where I'm stuck.   The help claims that /def returns
the macro number.  So, it seems to me there should be a way to do
something like this:

    /enqueue  {the number returned by /def = say hi there nox}  work_queue

    /def do_work1 = /#$(/dequeue work)

What is the syntax here?  I can't seem to figure this out.

Thanks,
-Bruce

This is what I've used. After all, maybe it's just good to list the
variables that will be used. It's just so booooring.

Debugging code with tf is already hard enough. It's a murder to set
pedantic off.

Can't do that because there are also other people using tf with our linux
box.

So I'll use the first one. Thanks.

Sure you can. Make an installation local to your own home directory. TF
doesn't
need system-wide privilegies to work.

TF 5.0 already supports "unconnected sessions", and a function to
simulate receiving text in those sessions so the text will go through
trigger processing.  Sorry, I don't have a release date for 5.0 yet.

Since people keep speculating on new features, below is the current
changelog for 5.0.  Everything in the list is already implemented.  If
some entries don't make much sense, it is because they are intended as
reminders to myself (in particular, the "UNDOCUMENTED" section is to
remind myself to write the documentation for those new features).


5.0 alpha
---------
Non-ANSI compilers are no longer supported.

DOCUMENTED
regmatch() returns any positive integer for success, not necessarily 1
    (so you should write (regmatch(...)), not (regmatch(...) == 1)
Renamed log() to ln() to avoid confusion with /log.
Lines beginning with '#' in /load'ed files are comments (and ';' still works).
Supports IPv6 (RFC 2553 and 2133).
Supports Mud Client Compression Protocol (MCCP) v2.
Added /paste options -x (execute) and -n (no prefix).
%meta_esc=on always converts a typed meta bit to ESC; %meta_esc=nonprint
  converts only if character is not printable.  The LNEXT key (^V) overrides
  %meta_esc.
Tabs are no longer confused by ANSI display codes from server.
Added -P option to /quote and /repeat to run on prompts, like %lpquote.
Prompted (-P or %lpquote) processes with a -w option are only run by prompts
  from the specified world.
Added /runtime.
If an additive operation on integers would overflow, it is converted to real.
TF will not terminate on SIGHUP if SIGHUP was ignored when TF was started.
/ps lists processes in ascending order of pid.
/paste accepts "." to end.
Added -A, -B, -C options to /recall to print lines of context around each
  matching line.
"/restrict file" disables /lcd.
Added %keepalive to detect dead connections even while idle.
Added %keypad to control application keypad mode.
getopts() options can take time arguments.
Optional offset argument to strchr(), strstr().
Optional length argument to tolower(), toupper().
Simplified proxy customization (but an old proxy_command that worked in 4.0
  will still work).
Clock defaults to 24 hour format (see /help clock).
Added %sigfigs.
Improved telnet protocol handling, and detection of telnet vs. non-telnet
  servers.  Apparent telnet commands commands are not stripped from data
  stream if server doesn't use telnet protocol.  /localecho may be delayed.
Changed default keybindings to be more consistent with those in emacs, bash,
  and other gnu readline applications.  The old bindings can be restored with
  "/load kb-old.tf".  See "/help keys".
  The most important changed keys are:
      Old          New                       Meaning
      ^[b ^[f      ^[{ ^[} ^[left ^[right    change foreground socket
      ^B ^F        ^[b ^[f                   move cursor by one word
      left right   ^B ^F left right          move cursor by one character
Added /purgealias to alias.tf.
Added /randline to textutil.tf.
Added is_connected().
bg_output is tested when socket is foregrounded (like /fg -q), instead of when
  text is received.
New screen handling:
  /dokey redraw (^L) actually redraws screen.
  Added /dokey clear (^[^L) to clear screen.
  %shpause defaults to on.
  Eliminated all "Resuming TinyFugue" messages and RESUME hook.
  Default status_int_world prepends "!" if foreground socket is a zombie.
  Changing a status_{int,var}_* will cause the status line to update.
Time is measured and printed with microsecond resolution:
  %prompt_sec and %prompt_usec replaced with %prompt_wait
  /recall:  h:m[:s[.f]] is interpeted as time-of-day, s.f as absolute time.
  ftime():  "%@" includes microseconds; added "%.", "%s", "%F", "%T" formats.
  /ps, time(), idle(), sidle() print or return values to the microsecond.
  Time values for /repeat, /quote, /at, %ptime, %maildelay can be specified
    to the microsecond.
Arguments to ftime() are optional.
ftime() supports %E and %O if system library does.
Added mktime().
Added "i" argument to /repeat for infinite count.
Variables used in status_fields do not need to exist.
Optional <pid> argument to /ps.
Expression variables are stored internally as natural types instead of strings
  for greater efficiency and to avoid loss of floating point precision.
Display attributes in string values are preserved by just about every string
  operation:  commands, variables, expression operators, functions, regexp
  substitutions, $() command substitution, and status bar field expressions.
Improved workaround for solaris terminal driver bug that could disable
  keyboard after typing LNEXT (^V), FLUSH (^O), STOP (^S), or START (^Q);
  also, in the extremely unlikely case that it does happen, it can be fixed
  with any signal (e.g., ^Z or ^C) without quitting tf.
Fixed handling of bold-off display attribute code from server.
An error within a tfrc file does not cause tf to try to load an alternate file.
When server requests window size (TELNET NAWS), tf sends %wrapsize instead of
  the actual screen width.
Fixed: "/addworld" with no args clears the name of the first defined world.
Fixed: "/unset MAIL" crashed tf.
Added "substr" matching type.
Added %tfhost and "/addworld -s<srchost>" to define client address of
  connections.
TF closes all open sockets, pipes, and files before the 'Press any key' prompt
  when dumping core, so servers and other processes don't have to wait for the
  keypress.

UNDOCUMENTED
is_open([world])
fake_recv(string[, world])
"windowed" (unconnected-but-open) worlds.
new /listsocket flags:  p=proxy, o=open, c=connected, x=connected-ssl
ESC-digit; global and local %kbnum; /dokey {recall,search}{b,f}, and
    recall{beg,end}, and macros in kbfunc.tf honor kbnum
/fg -cN
nextopt numeric args can be signed
MORE status field is updated when limit changes, and shows "LIM".
/limit [-A] [-v] [-m<style>] <pattern>:  redraws screen, showing only lines
    that match <pattern> and/or have attributes (-A).  With no args, returns
    1 if limit is in effect, 0 if not.
Scrollback!
    /dokey hpageback (PgUp, ^X[), /dokey hpage (^X]),
    /dokey pageback (^X{), /dokey page (^X}),
    /dokey lineback (^[^P)
    /dokey line (^[^N)
    /dokey_flush means jump to end
    /dokey_selflush acts like limit
winlines()
Disables tty STOP/START to avoid problems and make ^S/^Q available to tf.
ssl:  /addworld -x, addworld(...use_proxy), /connect -s, /listsockets
/paste -t -q [cookies]
vercmp() (in stdlib.tf)
/pfxgen and pfcmd() (in pcmd.tf)
Changed how attributes combine:  colors always override, not OR; inline x
  causes replacing of line attrs.
Synchronous processes can be interrupted.
Replaced Henry Spencer's regexp pacage with PCRE (Perl Comaptible Regular
  Expressions).  It is backwards compatible, with one exception:  the character
  '{' introduces a quantifier, so you must use '\{' to match a literal '{'.
  Also, regexps containing no uppercase letters default to caseless matching.
macro usage counts with /list -su.
Added inline_attr().
Network/host unreachable does not cause disconnect, only loss of sent text.
New screen handling:
  Per-world screen buffers, including More prompt.
  %virtscreen (do not change while at a More prompt).
  Redraw after /suspend, /sh, and changing window size, %visual, or %isize.
  Doesn't automatically leave a dead socket if the text hadn't been seen.
  WORLD hook is silent (if virtscreen).
  A disconnected socket does not disappear automatically after displaying its
    buffered text.  It will dissappear if you /dc it again, or /fg another.
Fixed: if a loaded file did not end with newline, the last line was executed
  twice.

Hrm.  So does this mean that providing support for perl is no longer a
part of TF5?

As far as I know, it never was.  Support for the Perl Compatable Regular
Expressions was.

I thought it was just perl regular expressions (through pcre) that was
promised.

-doh-  You're right.  I went back and looked and that /was/ all

Triggers already work in background worls, or do you mean something
else?

Triggers will still work in background worlds.  %bg_output never had
any effect on triggers on background lines, only on the display of
background lines.  That entry says the decision to display the line is
now made when the socket is fg'd, instead of when the line is
received.  So now it's possible to have bg_output=off, get a bunch of
lines in a background socket, decide you really do want to see them,
and do so by setting bg_output=on before you /fg the socket.

that's what i mean. triggers currently work in bg worlds when text is received.
it just reads as if it's a new thing in tf5, that triggers won't catch stuff in
bg worlds until they are fg'd :/

i know i must be wrong, because that'd be moronic to implement, it just reads
like that, to me, anyway :)

I supplied a patch to the list that does this, oh, about 4 years ago.

I also have a newer patch from about a year ago that also allows tf to use
the 256 color xterm extension. (8 normal, 8 bright, 24-color greyscale
ramp, and a 6x6x6 color cube).

It really makes color hilighting *rock*. :)

I've noticed ^L clears the screen rather than just redrawing it. Is
there a way to just refresh it with the text remaining? Also, I'm
hoping in TF5, given that it sounds as if the display has been more or
less reworked, that this won't be an issue any longer.

For TF5. That doesn't help me now. My assumption was that this is
true, which has been proven by the quoting from the ChangeLog. I also
will take it that this means there's no current way of doing it.

As far as I can tell there's no way to do this. TF4 keeps a record of 
incomming lines, but doesnt keep a display framebuffer, which is what's 
required for a screen refresh.

Apparently, there's supposed to be a colour definition file along with 
that patch. Any chance you could mail that one too ?

Sorry for spamming the list with unnecessary emails, folks. I'm not 
keeping good track of who I'm sending email to :)

Anyway, I've included the colour definition file, and Scott's impromptu 
README in with the other... so now its a more complete collection.

http://onca.catsden.net/~chris/tf-patches/

As per the readme, Scott, nor myself (because I have no clue :) will 
support this, but I'll happy update any of the instructions if found to be 
inaccurate.

I'm looking into integrating it into the mainline code I keep on
druware.com.  

I've been considering bringing up a CVS server for TinyFugue and another
OpenSource project I'm involved in.  Though, even if I do so, it would
be a branch of the main code, NOT Ken's official code.  That's been
what's prevented me from doing so to this point.

Hi all,

I'm new at MUDs and programming so apologies in advance for the stoopid 
questions.  Love linux and refuse to go to a windows client so will 
probly be here for a while.

Anyway, I am currently trying to use colours to hilite different things 
and at the moment am using the following:

/def -auCred -t"You have recovered balance *"

In the MUD balance is a big thing and until I can work out how to test 
the prompt want to know when I have it.

Now the text returned is underlined and bold but not red.

When I do:
 /help color - i can see the colours in the help file.

In the shell i do
echo $TERM and get 'xterm'
It displays white on black.

I have set in my .tfrc file:
 /set emulation=ansi_attr

In the MUD itself you can also set colours for different forms of text 
received.

Have tried to include as much info as possible.  

Can someone tell me what things I need to change/investigate in order to 
get things working.

Many thanks,

Peter.

Is your XTerm configured to display colors?

Find out with:

ls --color=always

This should contain some other colors than black and white.

If not, you can try to enter the following lines in your ~/.Xdefaults 
file (assuming you are using X):

XTerm.VT100*colorMode:  on
XTerm.VT100*dynamicColors:  on

For colors that are readable with black on white I use the following 
color definitions (belong to ~/.Xdefaults too):

xterm*background:       White
XTerm.VT100*cursorColor:  black
XTerm.VT100*color0:    #000000
XTerm.VT100*color1:    Red
XTerm.VT100*color2:    #00a800
XTerm.VT100*color3:    Orange3
XTerm.VT100*color4:    #0000a8
XTerm.VT100*color5:    Magenta
XTerm.VT100*color6:    #00a8a8
XTerm.VT100*color7:    #909090
XTerm.VT100*color8:    DarkViolet
XTerm.VT100*color9:    Red3
XTerm.VT100*color10:   #007054
XTerm.VT100*color11:   Orange4
XTerm.VT100*color12:   Blue4
XTerm.VT100*color13:   Magenta4
XTerm.VT100*color14:   #006060
XTerm.VT100*color15:   #707070
XTerm*highlightSelection:  true
! The following 2 lines will give you blue output instead of bold
XTerm*VT100*colorBDMode:  on
XTerm*VT100*colorBD:  blue
! The following 3 lines will give you red output instead of underlined
XTerm.VT100*colorULMode:  on
XTerm.VT100*underLine:  off
XTerm*VT100*colorUL:  red

If you added those or similar lines to the .xdefaults file, restart your 
X ('xrdb ~/.Xdefaults' might help without restarting, but don't know 
exactly, simply try it and start a new xterm)

Hope this helps
  Ralf

Here is a very interesting question.
Does anyone have experience with getting Tinyfugue to handle prompts from
MUD's that are not of any standard origin?
I am using Tinyfugue with Achaea (http://www.achaea.com) and experiencing
some weird problems which I think are related to the prompt.
Achaea is a commercial MUD and is not based off of any others, though I
beleive it resembles Diku in a way. The engine is completely original.

No matter what terminal emulation, locale, even terminal program I am using;
Bold ANSI received from the MUD does not 'reset'. And any text displayed
after a line that is bold ANSI will be bold.
Also, for some reason, newlines are inserted after most lines, giving the
MUD a chopped up appearance.

I have played around with alot of the variables including the prompt hooks
and %{lp} mode settings. As well as tried all of the world types.
These options I have tried under multiple terminal programs and OS.

Nothing seems to be working. Any help suggestions? Greatly appreciated.

I want tf automatically execute commands when it's input line becomes more
than x chars. For example I load a menu to the screen (part of it):

.-------------.-------------.
| Echo is OFF | enable_echo |
'-------------'-------------'

Then by using mouse I double click "enable_echo" getting it highlited in
my terminal (PuTTY). By pressing right mouse button the terminal pastes
the text and sends it to tf. I want this so that when tf gets this text
(or any text), it, for example, executes a function /enable_echo. This way
I could use mouse as I couldn't find other ways.

So possibly, first input buffer is all empty. When it gets the pasted
"enable_echo" it does something. Or then after loading the menu to the
screen tf could replace the input buffer with "/menu_command ". And then
when the text is pasted it would automatically execute "/menu_command
enable_echo" without a need to press enter.

It would be nice not to get the all the command text visible to the
command line but just to keep it in store (possibly use some other
variable and keep input buffer untouched).

I could do this with /repeat but it can't be set to execute faster than 1
second (need faster or the speed-up becomes slow-down)? So some kind of
gotFocus event is needed. Can it be made with some hook (when command
line's value changes, it goes to some function and does this and that)? I
also need this event tracking function to be enabled only occasionally, so
it wouldn't matter if the solution was just /repeat every 0.1 seconds
which is impossible?

Is there a rule of thumb how much faster a simple trigger is compared to a
glob or regexp trigger? I wonder whether it is better to use 3 simple
triggers or 1 regexp trigger, for example. I dont't expect a constant
ratio (time for regexp)/(time for simple), but perhaps an estimate.

Thanks in advance,
Martin

I have a trigger that reads my prompt and parses it for variables.

/def -i -p9 -F -mregexp -h'PROMPT HP:([^ ]*) MV:([^ ]*) MA:([^ ]*)\> ' \
     catch_prompt = /test prompt ({*})%;/set woc_hp1=%P1%;/set \
     woc_mv1=%P2%;/set woc_ma1=%P3

These variables are then used in a report macro I created that I can use
to tell my party my condition quickly.

Well, this worked up until the mud added color to the prompt.  Is there
any way to match "HP:([^ ]*) MV:([^ ]*) MA:([^ ]*)\> " while ignoring
all of the color codes?

Thanks,
Russ

Hi All,

I'm just wondering and I know it's been mentioned in past posts, 
but I still don't know how to set it up.

Anyway, I wanted to send any tells I send someone or they send 
me, by somthing like You tell name 'hello....'. and Name tells you 
'hello....'. etc. and also want to log Name tells the group '.....'.
to a different window, which I believe someone suggested at one 
stage on the mailing list by a null world ? I sometimes deal with a 
lot of spam while I'm mudding and all, and get sick of missing tells 
every so often.

Any lines of code would be appreciated, thanks

Jono.

Is there a way to update the status bar to show an
alternate timezone than the one that the system clock
uses?

In particular, I have a very good friend that I use TF
to chat with, in Australia (Sydney/Melbourne zone). I
live in NY. I don't want to lose my personal system
time, but, it would be right handy to be able to
calculate "Oz" time, so, I'm not trying to remember
that she logs in @8:30 before DST and another time
after.

Gwen

I honestly am not too sure if you're willing to accept just one clock
on the status bar displaying the time of your choice, but TF does seem
to honor normal Unix timezone settings, ala:
'TZ="Australia/Queensland" tf' (this of course will vary based on
shell and system)
You said you didn't want to lose your personal system time, but maybe
you just meant you didn't want to reset your system's clock.

If you're using unix, (or this might even work under windows), use the TZ 
environment variable to set the timezone you're in. Like this:

   TZ=Australia/Melbourne tf

Here's some examples using the date function.

[chriscog@redhat sysconfig]$ date
Thu Apr  4 19:02:32 PST 2002
[chriscog@redhat sysconfig]$ TZ=Australia/Melbourne date
Fri Apr  5 13:02:33 EST 2002
[chriscog@redhat sysconfig]$ TZ=UTC date
Fri Apr  5 03:03:24 UTC 2002


This assumes your system is using the 'zoneinfo' system. You can pick any 
zone that is in /usr/share/zoneinfo

Not very pleasant but this line displays the time in the UK (me), AT
(time on the game) and MC is the timezone of a good friend of mine
(Canada).

The number is in seconds so its (hours from your timezone to his) * 60
* 60

/set status_int_clock strcat(ftime("%H:%M", time()), "__AT:", ftime("%H:%M", time()-18000), "__MC:", ftime("%H:%M", time()-14400))

/def setstatus = /set status_fields= @more:8 "_Wd:":4 @world:5 "_UK:":4 @clock:25 @read:6 @active:11  @log:5  @mail:6 insert:6

Hope it helps, its not the worlds tidiest code.

Whilst this probably works roughly 50 weeks out of 52 each year, there's
an issue; different areas move to and from summertime on different
dates, determined by different rules.

For instance, roughly speaking (ie, I haven't checked for exceptions),
continental North America moves to summertime this Sunday coming
(2002-04-07, first Sunday in April), whilst the EU moved to summertime
on the Sunday just gone (2002-03-31, last Sunday in March).

Whether or not this is worth worrying about, for something which mostly
works, is a matter of personal taste.  I don't see a way of improving
it without getting hideously complex.  Eg, define those offsets as
variables in a separate file which is generated at 6am each morning,
from cron.  Actually, perhaps that's not too hideous.

Unless %TZ can be localised to stop it exporting, and to keep changes
small in scope, whilst still being used by ftime()?  In which case,
/test might help.

Hi,

I write a chat server in which I send login prompts either terminated by
EOR or GA. EOR if the client responds that it can, otherwise GA.
If i add a 'lp' type world for such a server of mine, on connection, the
login prompt comes up fine, no problem.
But if I connect to a new chat server with just /world, i.e.
/world address port
The login prompt doesn't show up..even though my server debugging says
that TF will do EORs and I am sending an EOR, and TF says:

% This looks like an unterminated-prompt world, so I'm redefining it as
one.  You should explicitly set the type with the -T option of /addworld.
% addworld: Redefined world (unnamed1)

/listsockets says:
     LINES IDLE TYPE      NAME            HOST                       PORT
*  foregnd   2s prompt    (unnamed1)      xxxxxxx.xxx                xxxx


When i enter my login name and hit enter, the next EOR terminated prompt
(password prompt) shows up fine. So maybe there's a glitch where just the
first prompt which triggered the detection isn't getting outputted by TF?
I dont have any prompt hooks set or any defaults modified.
I've read the docs but couldn't find any furthur info to help me.
This is with 4.0 stable 1 on Linux 2.4.5

Any help is appreciated,

Why not do something like:
/def -Fq -p100 -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ tells? [^:]+:.*' telllog = \
  /test fwrite("telllog", "${world_name}: %P0")

and then do tail -f telllog in another window.  This way
you get a good history and can view them w/out switching 
worlds.  Alternatively, you could create a tells subdir to
put stuff in and do:
/def -Fq -p100 -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ tells? [^:]+:.*' telllog = \
  /test fwrite("tells/${world_name}", %%P0)

and:

tail -f tells/*

for some nice seperated output:
tail -f logs/tf/tells/*
==> /home/mark/logs/tf/tells/W1_Test <==
You tell Test: testing
Test tells you: testing

==> /home/mark/logs/tf/tells/W2_Test2 <==
Test2 tells you: testing
You tell Test2: testing

Notes:
You might not need the priority, I do for some other stuff I have
setup.  You might not also have world_name defined, I think that's
local to the stuff we have here.  I can't remember for sure though.

Let TZ do the work for you.  Save the current timezone, set TZ to the one you
want, call ftime(), then restore TZ to its original value.  This will show
the local time and the Sydney time:

    ; /tztime <timezone> [<format>]
    /def tztime = \
	/let oTZ=%TZ%; \
	/set TZ=%1%; \
	/time %-1%; \
	/if (oTZ=~"") /unset TZ%; /else /set TZ=%oTZ%; /endif

    /set status_int_clock=strcat($(/time %%H:%%M), " ", \
	$(/tztime Australia/Sydney %%H:%%M))

The value "Australia/Sydney" may not work on your system; see your
system's documentation.

You'll also have to incrase the width of the @clock field to 11 in
status_fields.

Okay, that's another approach to localising the effect.  :^)

Is there any compelling reason, one way or the other, to choose
$(/macro) with echo side-effect or function() displaying the return
value?

Eg, /tztime as above, or tzftime:
/def tzftime = \
        /let oTZ=%TZ%; \
        /set TZ=%1%; \
        /let retval=$[ftime({-1}, time())]%; \
        /if (oTZ=~"") /unset TZ%; /else /set TZ=%oTZ%; /endif %; \
        /return (retval)

/set status_int_clock=strcat(ftime("%H:%M", time()), " ", \
        tzftime("Australia/Sydney", "%H:%M"))

Is one form or the other going to be easier to convert to Tf 5?

Thanks,

Hello everyone.  I have received great advice here and I want to thank
you all for your time!  I dont have a problem so much as a lack of
programming knowledge on how to set up something that is probably very
easy to do.  I have set up a list of alias's for different rituals on my
mud that require sometimes over 10 events to be sent to finish one
ritual.  However, after line 1 is sent, I must get a particular prompt
from the mud before the next line can be sent.  I have tried using a
repeat type script that pauses a certain amount of time before each new
line is sent but as lag is unpredictable, the whole thing gets messed
up.  How can I set tf up to send my lines one after another after the
prompt from the mud has come?
For example:

;;Ritual 1
/def -h"SEND event1" event1 = do event1 stuff
/def -h"SEND event2" event2 = do event2 stuff
ect.....

How can I make a fast script that runs event 1 and 2 when I type in the
ritual name, that waits for a prompt?

I run tf on Windoze and have no idea how to "set" timezone information that 
works correctly, for example, /set TZ=PST8PDT does *not* change my timezone 
information from Eastern to Pacific. The Microsoft system clock seems to 
rule tf time functions.

To set a second timezone with alternate information (that tf can even read) 
is something I don't know how to do. Anyone know the answer to this?

I've just been working on customizing TF some more, and was wondering some
things.

Is it possible to set colors in the status line?  It seems to be able to
set every attribute /but/ colors... I don't mean for the whole line, that
it will do, but for specific things.

And how do I get /sh to take me into a shell that uses my usual prompt,
which is stored in .bash_profile?

No big issues.  Just little vaguely-irritating things. :)

Thanks!

You can set colors in status_fields when defining the line, like:
/set status_fields \
	@more:8:Br :1 @world:10 :1 @read:4:BCcyan :1 dyn_active :1 @log:3:Ccyan :1 insert:3:Ccyan :1 status_bar:1

In tf4, you can't adjust the colors inside of individual variables,
the only way is to edit the entire status_fields line.

The /sh thing reads the bash_profile from /etc/bash_profile. so gotta
change that as far as i know.

To change colours on the status line thingies. heres a example.

You add something by putting   variablename:width:colour   

So adding    wuss:3:BCred    would make the wuss variable 3 letters long
and red.

Dunn remember if it works to make the colour to a variable to buy might.
works to make the width to one atleast.

So where would that be changed, to make it read from ~/.bash_profile
first?

I did some more checking, and discovered the problem.  What I was trying
to do was use status_attr to make the whole line one color, then use the
fields bit to set certain things to be particular /other/ colors.  And
that doesn't work.  Can anybody think of a way to get this to do what I'm
asking it to? :)

~/.bash_profile is only ran when you log in... so it makes sense that
/sh inside tinyfugue doesn't run it.

If you want something to be run each time you start another instance of
bash, you need to put the commands in ~/.bashrc

Or am I misunderstanding the question?

You may update the status line itself by changing the attributes given to
the fields.

this has to be done within each trigger

there are other possibilities

patching tf-source, writing self-serving tf-macros :)

Okay, well, that's helped that part.  (I was told to put my prompt in
.bash_profile.  I really don't know all that much about how the shell
itself works, thus far.)

Which leaves the rest of the question--

How can I get the padding part of my status line to be one color, not the
default, and the fields to actually be whatever I set in status_fields?
If I set status_attr, that seems to nullify what's in status_fields, or
something along those lines.

Hi

Whenever I start up tinyfugue it has the time in the right hand corner like:

  Help on summary:
......
  If you are having trouble reading the help sections because text is
  scrolling off the screen, try typing "/more on" before /help, and then 
press
  TAB at a "--More--" prompt when you're ready to continue. 

___________________________________________________________________________05:31
/help

I have found a very annoying thing is that whenever it ticks over 1 
minute it goes back to the bottom of the terminal.

It usually takes me way longer to read help files and screen output than 
a minute so regularly lose where i was up to.

Is there some sort of setting that I can turn on/off to stop this from 
happening?

Thanks in advance.

Peter.

hehe i have an idea, why dont you write a mailing list policy that allows
posting spam mail into the list, but doing so costs lets say some nice round
number .., $500 per post :) most of those ppl are trying to make money so they
have fax number, mailing address or something in that sense in the email, you
could send them invoice together with the rules of the mailing list :) i doubt
that you would ever make any money out of them without taking them to court,
but it would most likely get rid of them for a bit ;)

                                                Dingo.

Or change your %{SHELL} to be bash -l

Probably the latter, as putting a bunch of extra non-login stuff in your
bashrc will be a pain for general interactive shell usage.

I have a simpler solution.  I complain to their ISPs using SpamCop, 
each time and every time.  I can't prove it works, but it sure makes 
me feel better about having to pay to download all their rubbish...

Hello all

Has tf an option equivalent to 'Execute Script' from zMud?

I use this option in zMud to send the content of a file to the mud (I mean every line of the file
contains a valid mud command)... it is very usefull if you have alias files and like that you can
set up your aliases to become mud aliases and not client aliases...

So, is there any chance to execute in tf the same scripts I execute with zMud?


Best regards,
Alin.

/test seems to have problems with return values

I tried:

/def x=/return "abc"

and
/test x(),echo({?})

but instead of abc
only a empty string was echoed

This works for me:
 /test x()%;/test echo({?})

  /test evaluates the <expression> and returns its value, also setting the 
  special variable %?.

So at the time that /test returns the value, it sets %?.  Nothing says
that it's set before then.

I've got the following problem in tf.
I wrote a quicksort that is called in another macro.
If pedantic is set on, tf warns about non-numeric string values.

I reduced the problem to the macros listed below.
It is reproducable.

% pedantic=on
% y: warning: non-numeric string value used in numeric context
% 252: /def x = /if (1) /y a%;/endif
% 253: /def y = /return {1}%;/while (0) /done

If the /while in y is replaced by /if or /y a is called on the commandline
or without the enclosing /if the problem doesn't occur.

After studying the sources for serveral hours. I concluded that tf
correctly interprets the {1} expression of the return but then perhaps has
problems with it's instruction pointer and searches for the continuation
of a conditional expression (which???) and tries to handle {1} as an
boolean value in valbool() which calls valint() that produces the warning.

As I got totally confused at this point, I stopped debugging the source
and tried to reduce the problem to a simple case.

And no setting pedantic off is not an option, as many other people use
this stuff who want their tf to be pedantic.

In the real code the warning appears for each parameter passed to the
quicksort macro (Just imagine the scroll of perhaps 50 parameters).

Michael (Mesirii) this time asking for help :)

Not answering the rest of your question at the moment, but here's a nice

The message is a bug in tf, which I've fixed in the 5.0 code.

My qsort.tf code that David mailed out doesn't invoke that bug, and is
also well optimized for tf and well tested (I and several other people have
been using it for years).

I can't remember if this has been discussed here before (I asked it
somewhere else), but here are two questions I could test with tf but I
want to know if things are executed in the way I thought they would.

Help on: functions: strstr()
  strstr(s, t)
          (int) First position of <t> within <s>, or -1 if <s> does not
          contain <t>.

Help on: functions: strchr()
  strchr(s, t)
          (int) First position within <s> of any character contained in
	  <t>, or -1 if <s> does not contain any characters from <t>.

So with strstr() tf makes a loop, checking character per character if
given string <t> exist in current part of string <s>? And with strchr() tf
needs to do this once per every character included in <t>? Computer is
able to work with only one character at time? I just became to wonder if
I should create my own functions similiar to these if they're called
often, to find shortcuts at some parts of code, to save computing time?

As these are mapped directly to c functions every piece of code you would
write would be much slower.

But if a builtin function would make this loop a loop of 100 and I could
shorten it to 10 executes, then which way would be slower? Regarding
string handling.

I really have a hard time imagining that these string functions
are costing you any performance what so ever.  With tf 4, macro
and expression execution is interpreted in such a way that I'd
expect most of your time to be spent in "macro parsing" not in
doing strchr/strstr operations.

Depending what you are trying to do, you may find things like
regmatch more useful/efficient.

In any case, you should not even try adding a new function for
"performance" in tf until you've built a tf with profiling turned
on, and collected gprof stats on your *normal* usage and seen where
the actual time is spent.  And if it turns out you're calling
strchr/strstr a lot from tf macros, then you might also be better
off fixing the algorithm of the macro to be smarter rather than
special casing some other calls.

x is called as a function, not as a command, so it returns its value instead
of setting %?.  So, a correct usage would be

    /test var:=x(), echo(var)

or just

    /test echo(x())

(Given this explanation, you might expect %? to contain the value set by
the command prior to the /test command.  This is what should happen, but
there is a bug that clears %? when a macro is called as a function.)

Personally, I'm getting sick of the spam that's coming through on this 
list, especially since I cant put in 'spamcop' into the MTA to kill it 
before its received :)

Can we put the list into 'post from subscribed address only' mode, please?

Okay.  Some further clarification:

My whole status line is currently set to be cyan.  If I set the 'world'
attribute to be, say, yellow... then it does it.  But the rest--well, the
ones I can check quickly, like mail and more and the time... if they get
set to any different color, they revert to white.  Other attributes work
fine. Strange.

I've also got another question, then--how can I get other attributes to
actually evaluate before being put on the line?  I'd like to set it up to
report both the world name and character name, and the only thing I've
managed so far is to add the character name to the world field, not to
actually set up a separate one. :)

Not that any of this is essential stuff.  Just trying to make my client
look good.

Hi,

I've got a problem using /sh

Even with a -ag -hRESUME Hook and /sh -q it always generates 2 empty lines
when returning.

If I understand the code correctly this is the result of restoring visual
mode.
If /sh is called without visual=on those lines do not appear.

And with isize=1 not as well.

The number of lines generated by /sh seems to be isize-1.

Does anyone have a solution to this?

I am also looking for a replacement for /sys with win-tf as it doesn't
support tfopen(..,"p")

Thanx,

Mesirii

than one process. Ofcourse I can kill all the processes using /mapcar
command, but if i want to kill only processes that send something to the
mud, and others, which for example updates some data I want to have runing
becomes very hard to code.
I see some ways in newer versions of TF to avoid such problems:
- creating classes for some processes. Then - you can use /kill
<class_name> to kill all processes from that class
- making priorities - like in linux processes - /kill -3 would kill all
the processes with 3, 2 and one priority.

Hi.

I have made something like this and it should be add in TF5 not exacly
in that form ... but it is a good thing when you want to run proces
once ..
Making classes would make only mess, but priorties would be a nice thing

Hi!

   I'm trying to figure out how to set up a set of names and when one 
of the names comes up to highlight just the name.  I haven' had much 
luck figuring out how to set up a set though.  Any pointers or sample 
tf files much appreciated.

Thanks!
David

The who list should only pose a problem if two of the names appear in the
same line. Or if the names differ from those in the sentences. Regexp
triggers are case sensitive!

You may define a macro:
--------------------------------------------------------------
;first definition
/def -t"none" -mregexp -P0Cyellow -F t_hl_names

; usage /hl_add Name
/def hl_add = \
	/if (hl_names=~"") \
	   /set hl_names=%1%;\
	/else \
	   /set hl_names=%hl_names|%1%;\
	/endif%;\
;redefinition
	/edit -t"(%hl_names)" -mregexp t_hl_names

; If you want to save your names you may use

/def hl_save = \
   /test fwrite('hl_names.var',strcat('/set hl_names=',hl_names))

; and:

/def hl_load = \
   /load hl_names.var%;\
; Load successful
   /if ({?}) \
      /edit -t"(%hl_names)" -mregexp t_hl_names%;\
   /endif

; If you include this into your file the names saved last time are
; reloaded when loading the file
/hl_load
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is not testet but I hope it works :)

Have Fun

Michael

Hello!

I would like to write a /my-toggle function which toggles variables this
way: on -> off
     off -> on
     yes -> no
     no -> yes

So I could do for example '/set loot yes' and then I after the command
'/my-toggle loot', loot would be 'no'.

I came up with this, it didn't work tho :-(

,----
| /def my-toggle = \
|         /let _res $$[%1] %;\
|         /eval /echo this is _res: %_res %;\
|         /if (_res =~ "on") \
|                 /set %{1} "off" %;\
|         /elseif (_res =~ "off") \
|                 /set %{1} "on" %;\
|         /elseif (_res =~ "yes") \
|                 /set %{1} "no" %;\
|         /elseif (_res =~ "no") \
|                 /set %{1} "yes" %;\
|         /endif
`----

I have absolutely no idea what my mistake is, please help! :-(

TIA

Though I do have a query, which involves prompt handling...
Some of which TF appears to have some problem dealing w/ multiple line
prompts.
With visual=on, and a 3 line typespace. if the mud sends a 2 line prompt
only the 2nd line of the prompt goes into your typeSpace the other line
-the first line gets placed into your viewspace window...
Anyone had this problem?

Michael.

Hello again!

I have a list of words in a variable like: 
'/set foo armor shield stone'

Now I would like to remove words from it destructively.  I tried for
example (I wanted to remove shield): '/eval /set foo /remove shield %foo',
but then foo's value became: '/remove shield armor shield stone'.

What is the solution?  I could use a little exlanation too! ;-)  Thanks
in advance!

as /remove echoes it's return value you should use:

/set foo=$(/remove shield %foo)

$() captures the output of an macro and returns it

/require lisp.tf

To remove the first item:

 /set foo $(/cdr %foo)

To remove the item "shield":

 /set foo $(/remove shield %t)

The lisp.tf macros ("/help lisp") handle a bunch of list-manipulation
duties for you, without having to go through hoops.

This may require me to modify tiny fugue source code.. but.. I want it so
a certain macro will be called everytime a packet is received.

This may sound kind of wierd, but I play a certain mud where there is
this one wierd event that happens that might be real or fake.. in fact
it is two seperate things at once.

I did some sniffs of the traffic, and the only difference is that
the fake data comes in one packet. And a real attack uses two seperate
packets.

I looked at ACTIVITY hook, but that apparently only works when you first
connect to a mud.

This would require you to modify either the OS or build a separate interface
on top of a packet sniffing interface.  The TCP sockets API does not
provide indication of packet delivery, just a stream of bytes.  If two
packets are sufficiently close together in time relative to when your
program reads them, they will be merged.

Michael and Phil, thank you for your really fast answers!  I wasn't
aware of '$(...)', things are a little bit clearer now. :-)

A side note: both of you wrote '/set foo $(/remove shield %foo)'.  It
only works if I prepend '/eval' to it.  I wonder if you you just forgot
it or am I still missing something here? :-)

Because they are writing what you'd put in a macro, under the
assumption that no one would want to type something that complicated
at the command line.

Like you'd probably make a macro:

/def remove-foo =\
    /set foo $(/remove %1 %foo)

And do /remove-foo shield  or whatever.

Ohh, that makes sense, thank you, I learned a lot about tf from this

    I am having some problems and am hoping someone could point out what I
am doing wrong.  What I wan to do is emulate a queue of commands and then
perform the commands in the queue on demand.  All I need is a macro to add
commands to the queue, then a macro to perform it.
    I haven't yet started to figure out how to create a dynamic list of
commands, so I defined two macroes as such:
/def qcmd1=look
/def qcmd2=score
;;; and then faking the queue of commands
/set myQ=/qcmd1 /qcmd2
;;; /def addq=add commands to the queue -- not done (obviously)

Here is my macro I am trying to execute the commands in the queue.  I am
still learning TF, so I probably have most of this mixed up, but it doesn't
work correctly.
/def performQ= \
        /set qSize=$(/length %myQ) %; \
        /while ({qSize} > 0) \
                /eval -s0 $(/first %myQ) %; \
                /set myQueue=$(/eval $(/rest %myQ)) %; \
                /set qSize=$(/length %myQ) %; \
        /done

    I have changed this around various times, but this seems the closest to
what it 'should' look like.  Perhaps someone could point out my error(s), or
maybe someone has implemented something like this already that they can
share with me.

Thanks in advance,
M...

If you try this in the command line you need eval as its input isn't
automagically evaluated. within a macro you don't have to use /eval as the
macro body is evaluated before running it.

(btw. you may have the command line input evaluated by setting sub to full
but this has many unwanted side effekts for me :)

Have fun

Michael

It depends if the commands you want to add to the list, are single words
or multiple ones.

A quite simple solution would be the following:
this it not tested but it should work

/def add_cmd = \
	/if (cmd_list=~"") \
	   /set cmd_list=%*%;\
	/else \
	   /set cmd_list=%cmd_list#%*%;\
	/endif

; it builds up a string composed of commands that are separated by #
; these commands can be mud commands or tf commands or even tf code pieces
; eg. /add_cmd look
; /add_cmd /do_this
; /add_cmd /look_at me%;/look_at enemy

/def next_cmd = \
	/if (cmd_list!~"") \
	   /let off=$[strchr(cmd_list,"#")]%;\
	   /if (off>-1) \
	      /let this_cmd=$[substr(cmd_list,0,off)]%;\
	      /set cmd_list=$[substr(cmd_list,off+1)]%;\
	   /else \
	      /let this_cmd=%cmd_list%;\
	      /set cmd_list=%;\
	   /endif%;\
	   /eval %this_cmd%;\
	/endif%;\

Have Fun

What he said.  But I'll also point to a Ken Keys binding, which has been
thrown out before:

; From Ken Keys [ESC RETURN turns on substitution for the current line only=
]:
/def -b'^[^M' =3D /sub full%;/dokey newline%;/sub off

That's what I used to double-check what I wrote, before sending.  Very
very useful, for those few times when I _do_ want "/sub full" for a
command-line.

I'm a tf newby with a simple question.

How can I change the background colour of the display. There must be a 
simple default setting or variable somewhere, but I haven't found it.

Thanks

Anthony

As far as I know it's your terminal that handles the colour. Many
terminals have possibility of adjusting colour values.

Howdy,

Just a quick question, and hopefully straight forward.

I use the /repeat command to issue time delayed commands (if theres a better way of doing this i'd love to know!), but unfortunately I only seem to be able to delay by the second. What I really need is some way of issuing a command with a 1.5 second delay such as /repeat -1.5 1 jab something.

Is there any fairly simple way to emulate the #wait <miliseconds> in zmud?

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer, and apologies for uzing the 'z' word.

Richard.

Hello!

I noticed that /rest gives back the wrong result if it's parameter only
has one value (word).  For example '/rest foo' gives back 'foo' instead
of empty string (?).

What is the proper way of setting a variable's value to empty string?
How can I check the emptyness? /if (foo =~ "")?

Would someone give me a /rest version that gives back empty when there
is only one word on it's parameter list?

Thank you. :-)

But it does give back the empty string if there is only one item.  Have
you redefined rest somehow?

/rest a b c
--> b c
/rest a
--> 

> What is the proper way of setting a variable's value to empty string?

/test foo := ""

Yes, you're right, I made a big mistake, i did this:

,----
| /set kill_ring $(/rest %kill_ring)
`----

When the $() expression gave back the empty, the /set didn't take it
as parameter.  So after I read your letter I came up with this:

,----
| /test kill_ring := "$(/rest %kill_ring)"
`----

Thanks for your answer again! :-)

Btw, i've made a nice and simple kill ring system.  You can specify
trigger / keyword sets for mobs like this

,----
| /make-kill-ring-trigger A tiny elemental form wanders about. elemental
| /make-kill-ring-trigger A small eddie current swirls junk around here. eddie
| /make-kill-ring-trigger A warrior of the Rainbow Cult swears his loyalty. warrior
| /make-kill-ring-trigger A small rock. elemental
`----

Notice that the last word is a keyword for the mob.  Now when you are in
a room the triggers fill the variable 'kill-ring' with keywords:

,----
| The Electric Playground
| [Exits: east south]
| Though there is a seemingly carefree atmosphere here, you sense that
| something much more important takes place near by.  The playground continues
| south and east.
| You notice a few drops of blood on the floor.
| A lava beast spews from place to place.
| A small spark of electricity fizzles here.
| A baby rainbow dragon plays among the elements here.
| A baby rainbow dragon plays among the elements here.
|
| >> kill-ring: elemental elemental dragon dragon
`----

The variable 'kill-ring' gets filled with the corresponding keywords.
Now the command /kr-kill send 'kill keyword' to the world:

,----
| => /kr-kill
| sending: stance bull
| sending: kill elemental
| >> kill-ring: elemental dragon dragon
| You hunch down into the bull fighting stance.
| => /kr-kill
| sending: kill elemental
| >> kill-ring: dragon dragon
| => /kr-kill
| sending: kill dragon
| >> kill-ring: dragon
| => /kr-kill
| sending: kill dragon
| >> kill-ring: 
`----

The actual code is this, feel free to comment! :-)

,----
| ;; set it on...
| /set kr off
|
| /alias kr /my_toggle kr
|
| ;; for unique trigger names
| /set _kill_ring_trigger_counter 0

A better way to do that would be to add an '=' to your original /set command,
to force it to be an assignment even if the value is blank:

    /set kill_ring=$(/rest %kill_ring)

The /test solution will probably work for you in this situation, but in
general you need to be careful that the expansion doesn't create an invalid
or unwanted expression.  For example, if kill_ring contained

    foo bar"baz quux

then the /test expression becomes

    kill_ring := "bar"baz quux"

which is a syntax error.  You could also postpone the expansion to when the
expression is evaluated, like this:

    /test kill_ring := $$(/rest %%kill_ring)

so the /test expression becomes

    kill_ring := $(/rest %kill_ring)

and the right hand side is evaluated by the expression.
But the /set solution is simpler.

BTW, you should look at the files in the directory named by %TFLIBDIR.
They're not all documented in /help.  In particular, stack-q.tf has
/enqueue and /dequeue that would've saved you a few lines in manipulating
kill_ring, and lisp.tf (which is documented) has some other macros that are
useful for this sort of thing.

Thanks I've replaced my queue manipulation with /enqueue /dequeue (lot
less messy now :-)).

Now I've encountered another problem.  I wrote a spell-up script that
looks at my 'affects' output, if it sees a spell it removes it from a
list, then casts the rest.

For example I have: /set spellup_spells shield bless protection armor

If I have shield and armor on me, then a temporary variable becomes
'bless protection', after that 'c bless' and 'c protection' will be sent
to the mud.

So far so good, but what about spells like 'detect invis' and 'detect
hidden'?

I think I could do something like '/set spellup_spells detect_invis
detect_hidden' and before sending the cast command replacing all _ with
spaces.

I tried lot of variations of '/replace _ ' ' foo' etc but couldn't find
the right one!

Try using it function form.  Quotes don't mark arguments in macro
form.  In this case you are calling /replace with 4 arguments:
	1. _
	2. '
	3. '
	4. foo

Try:
/let expanded=$[replace("_", " ", foo)]

And you can do similar in the other direction before storing commands.

If you need to also be able to handle commands which may actually have
_ in them, then I suggest you just use a generic encode/decode function
which handles all of that.  There have been a couple posted on the list
in the past.

I'm having some trouble tracking down a bug in my macros.  The
spammyness of /mecho is making it hard to actually spot where the bug
is, though.  What I'd like to do is turn it on for logging, go through
until the bug pops up, then analyze the log to find out what the bug
is.

Can this sort of thing be done?  I don't see a hook for it, so I don't
have much hope.

Ooo cool, thank you!  I saw this notation in the help file, but wasn't
paying attention, I thought I could do everything the "other way".
Sure, I was wrong. ;)

Hi,
    I am still familiarizing myself with tf and slowly converting some old
tintin/ytin script over.  Also, when creating some new scripts I was
wondering if this situation is possible:
    I want to create a counter of different damage verbs to see frequency of
how I am doing.  I have created the trigger to recognize the verb, but I
don't know how to create a counter for that verb.  Here is two example
outputs from the mud:

Your attacks strike the grand templar 2 times, with mangling viciousness!
Your attack strikes the grand templar 1 time, with *EVISCERATING* brutality!

And here is the trigger expression to pick it up

/def -p0 -ag -mregexp -t'^(Your attac.* strikes?) ([a-zA-Z0-9\-\.\,\'\ ]+)
([1-9]+) (tim.* with) (\**)([a-zA-Z]+)(\**) ([a-zA-Z]+)!'

So the "verb" is %P6.  The reason I capture everything in brackets is
because I echo it out in a different format.  What I want to count is the
frequency of the second last word.  What I would like to be able to do is
create a dynamic variable based on that word (note: the word can be upper or
lower case).  An alternative I could do, although not desirable, is I could
just compare it against particular verbs (ick!).  In yTin/tintin I was able
to accomplish this, but have not figured out how to do it with tf yet.
Although, I am sure it can be done, and probably easier.

Thanks!

Been experimenting with triggers, trying to setup "critical hit" 
announcements, the LPMud I play displays a string along with a damage 
indicator ** Blah blah blah (x2 damage) **

However, both the strikes FROM foes, and TO are displayes using nearly the 
same strings, so using a * to trigger it will have me saying "bang x2" 
even if the strike was FROM a foe.

The mud however, does support color, and coloration of tags, is there a 
way to setup a trigger based on the COLOR of the text? make it look for 
the ANSI sequence AND the x# damage message and act accordingly?

Like if it sees the text "(x2 damage)" in GREEN, its a strike TO a foe, 
and if its in RED, its FROM. It would then act out the trigger (saying the 
appropriate one-line) 

** You have been struck a hearty blow! (x2 damage) **
^^ RED. = "You're gonna hit ME x2?
** A wonderful attack! (x2 damage) **
^^ GREEN. = "2 for 1 special!

I tried setting up /trig *blow! (x2 damage)* = "You're gonna hit ME x2?
and it works, as well as all the attacks TO foes 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16 but 
due to the huge amount of hit messages FROM foes, it is unfeasible to 
setup a trigger for each monster.

So can looking for color save the day?

Hi all,

I am using TF 4.0 stable 1 with Windows NT, and am encountering the 
following problem. As soon as TF is running (connected or not, executing 
triggers or not), every ~ 2 minutes it causes the system load to raise to 
100% for about 5 seconds. This effect doesn't cause TF itself to slow down, 
but all other applications stop working for the mentioned amount of time.

Does anyone have an explanation for this problem or an idea how to solve 
it? I already tried to set the process priority for TF's DOS-Box to 'high' or 
'low', but it didn't change anything. I am not sure whether it is a problem of 
TF itself or of the cygwin-environment required for running TF under 
Windows.

Any help is greatly appreciated. :-)
TIA,
Christian AKA Ahab@MorgenGrauen

Are you using a prebuilt version or one you built yourself?

This was an issue with the Cygwin b19 tools, but shouldn't be a problem with
t the later cygwin releases.

I'm trying to capture some text, put it in a variable, and then use 
it later but in all caps.  I've tried all sorts of combinations and 
can't get it to work. The latest attempt being:

/def -mregexp -t'^(.*), the Great*' which_great = \
	/set great=%{P1} %;/eval toupper(%{great})

/def gtest = message fred %{great}


Thanks!
David

BTW Is there a searchable archive of this list?  I imagine I could 
learn alot without bothering y'all with my newbie questions.

I think what you want to do is this:

/def testit=/set great=/eval $[toupper({1})]
/def -mregexp -t'^(.*), the Great*' which_great = \
    /set great=/eval $[toupper({P1})]

Just try:

/def -mregexp -t', the Great' which_great = \
	/set great=$[toupper({PL})]

use $[] to evaluate expressions
{PL} and {PR} are the left/right side of the matched expression

Why the eval ? It has no effect in your case :)

as $[] is evaluated during macro expansion
the line woul read after it:
if P1 was foobar
/set great=/eval FOOBAR
This would be the content of the great variable "/eval FOOBAR"
It makes no sense :)

My bad.. I was just using the /testit "macro" and that is how I got it to
work.  I didn't realize it would work differently in a trigger.

First I want to thank everyone for being so helpful.  The help I've 
gotten has get me from just giving up.

I'm trying to figure out how to have a script that I can tell 'pound 
3 nails' and it will execute pound nail 3 times.  There is a wait for 
balance in between so there need be a wait.  In Rapscallion it was 
@@watch for text 'text'  I looked at hooks thinking it should be 
there.  Anyway, this is what I have and it doesn't seem to want to 
stop, just keeps going:

def pnd = \
         /let to_pound =%1%; \
         pound %2 %; \
         /let to_pound=$[to_pound - 1]%; \
         /while (to_pound > 0) \
                 /def -t'You have recovered balance on all limbs.' \
                         balance_wait = \
                         pound %2%;  \
                         /let to_pound=$[to_pound - 1]%;\
                         say {to_pound} %;\
         /done%; \
         /undef balance_wait


Thanks!
David

				^^^^

You need to put an extra % in when defining macros inside of macros
(and a third for macros in macros in macros, and so forth).

I'd wouldn't do it with a while loop, since holding tinyfugue in a
while loop will suspend all trigger/macro evaluation til it's done,
thus breaking all kinds of stuff.  I'd do something like this,
instead:

/def pnd = \
        /def -t'You have recovered balance on all limbs.' \
                balance_wait = \
                /send pound %%pound %%; \
                /set to_pound=$$[{to_pound} - 1] %%; \
                /if (to_pound == 0) \
                        /undef balance_wait %%; \
		/endif %; \
        /set to_pound=$[{1} - 1] %; \
        /set pound=%2 %; \
        /send pound %pound

It is.  You're missing the -n option.

/def pnd = /let count=$[{1} - 1] %; pound %2 %; \
 /def -n%count -t'You have recovered balance on all limbs.' \
  more_pounding = pound %2

If this is unclear or too "wordy" sorry :) Not used to mailing lists.
Michael.

I find this works well for me...
Get_V is version2 of Get_Var (shown below)

/def -i get_v2 = /return %{1}
/def -i get_v  = /get_v2 $[strcat({1},"_",{2})]%;\
		 /set %{1}_%{2}=%?%;\
		 /return %{1}_%{2}

GetVar was done to use a global variable that could have a different
value depending on which world it was queried from.

/def -i getvar =/let wn_var=$world_name%;/let wn_var=%{wn_var}_%{1}%;\
		/getvar2 %{wn_var}%;/set _%{1}=%?

/def -i getvar2 =	/return %{1}

/def -i getme = /getvar me
/def -i setvar =	/let wn_var=$world_name%;/set %{wn_var}_%{1}=%{2}
/def -i setme = /setvar me %{1}


An example of get_v below:

/def -i set_gain = \
    /let tmp_gain=$[{2} - get_v({1},"old")]%;\
    /set %{1}_old=%{2}%;\
    /if ({tmp_gain} != 0)%;\
        /if ({tmp_gain} > 999 | {tmp_gain} < -999)%;\
            /let tmp_gain=$[format_num({tmp_gain})]%;/endif%;\
        /set %{1}_gain=$[strcat(" {@{C3}",{tmp_gain},"@{n}}")]%;\
    /else /set %{1}_gain=%;/endif

I'll include "format_num" just for the sense of completeness...I don't
expect it will be of any use ... basically it takes in numbers and adds
in appropriate comma's ... may not be the most efficient way but it works - 
especially when yer looking at 6-12digit numbers ;)

How do people measure and profile performance of TinyFugue triggers
and code?  I've finally reached a point where I feel my stuff might be
getting a little burdensome on the client host, and I'd like to find
out where the problems are.  I'd also like to be able to test new
stuff before putting it in.

Hello,

I have the same kind of need: I'd like to implement a 'clever'
mapping, by checking if the latest move command was successful or not.

MUME sends back either "Alas, you cannot go that way...", either the room
name in green (by default). So, if I set a trigger to cancel the latest
move when encountering "Alas, ...", it won't work when I move too fast
for the server:
  
  <send north>                      ; Failed
  <send west>                       ; Successful
  Alas, you cannot go that way...   ; north reply
  <green> Bend in the Path          ; west reply

Canceling the latest path would remove west instead of north.

Well, if anyone has a solution...

Thanks,
Waba

I think that the "help" is a bit fuzzy in something as simple as doing a =
counter.
Such as in C: $i++;

I know that the TF isn't a "newbies" client, but a bit more practical =
examples would be great.
I am an experienced PHP and SQL coder, but I have problems with learning =
by abstract examples...

Regards, Gunnar

That looks more like Perl.

Anyway, in an expression (in a "/test", "/while ()", or "$[]"
substitution):

/set i 10 %; \
/test ++i %; \
/while (--i) \
    /set k $[++j] %; \
/done

It's not at all like either of those.  It's more like Tcl.

If you want actual example code, see the contents of your TFLIBDIR.

There is also a code library, though there isn't much in it, at
http://www.wilburware.net/code_library/browseLibrary.asp?class=8
That has some example code, and if you have more samples or code you'd like
to see added to it, I can add it.  When I finish the rewrite of the Druware
website now that I have gotten the company restarted (long story, but I
sold/merged with WilburWare, but the joined company wasn't going anywhere,
so I've restarted Druware and am moving everything back to the druware name
and consolidating everything back into that).  Once that move is completed
the library and all of it's contents will move back to the druware website.

I can't say that I am a Linux guru, so how do I set the locale so that I =
get the swedish keyboard layout?
- ie. =E5=E4=F6  (html: &aring;, &auml; and &ouml;)

I have it in the shell, but not in TF.

I use, under GNU/LInux, Red Hat 7.2, the following:

;; Language: swedish.
/set LANG sv_SE
/set istrip off

Hope this helps.

I'd like indented wrap-arounds, and am coming up short of a good way
of handling it. In a nutshell, that means I'd like any text string
that's wider than the screen to have all but the first line indented 8
spaces.

So:

Bob says, "dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar
frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar
frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar
frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot"
Sally says, "dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar
frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar
frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar
frink woot"


Becomes the easier-to-scan:

Bob says, "dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar
        frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot dag dar woodle
        dag dar frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot dag dar
        woodle dag dar frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot"
Sally says, "dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar
        frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot dag dar woodle
        dag dar frink woot dag dar woodle dag dar frink woot dag dar
        woodle dag dar frink woot"


I tried it with triggers, but the problem is that when I resize my
display and /recall, I can't make it reflow. Also, I seem to lose all
my ansi color if I process things as strings and spit them out again.

Am I perhaps missing some simpler way of handling this, of perhaps
catching text at display time instead of receipt time so I can just
inject spaces after each non-terminating carriage return?

/wrapspace 8
/help wrapspace

Although, most people seem to prefer something smaller like 4.

In tf:
 /help wrap
which points to:
 /help special variables
and you'll then see four wrap* variables.

> Am I perhaps missing some simpler way of handling this,

Look at the wrapspace variable.

What I'm trying to do is catch the first "word" I send after the login
Hook is caught, and then send that word(name) to the setme function.

When I use the -h CONNECT hook, it also has the sideeffect of opening
the new window in the background - which I don't want either :P

Would the LOGIN hook be used instead - the SEND hook doesn't seem to
catch text until you're in the Mud itself.
This is likely something basic, but this is one area of TF I've
never really delved into as deeply as other issues ;)
Any help would be appreciated.

/def -p1 -mregexp -h'CONNECT ' any_connect = \
   /def -p99 -n1 -F -mregexp -h'SEND ^([^ ]*[^ ])' catch_one_thing = \
         /setme %%*%%

I figured out...how to FORCE the catch of text to work...
But still the new World opens in the background.
Is there a way to force the world to be the foreground window?

This is what worked...
/def -p1 -mregexp -h'CONNECT ' any_connect = /setup_setme

/def setup_setme = /def -n1 -ip9 -ag -mglob -h"send *"  \
   alias_call_oneshot = /send %%*%%;/setme %%*

Is there a way to run a spell-checker directly from
the Windoze compile of tf?

Something where I could hit, say, esc-s and spell
check the current outgoing line, just like UNIX users?

Hey there.  Im a relativly longtime tinyfugue user, with some little
experience with triggers.  Ive written basic triggers, but nothing
advanced.  Ive recently been stumped while trying to get functions to
work within a trigger.

what I would like is a trigger which when it recieves the line

(name) kills (name2).   (note the .) will send "kill (name2)"

The trigger i have been trying (and many variations on this theme)
follows

/def -t '(name) kills *' kill_trig = kill substr(%3,0,strlen(%3)-2)

Which is sending "kill substr((name2),0,strlen((name2))-2)"

Im sure my problem is something simple.. but I cant work it out (Ive
spent 4 hours + working on this so feel free to call me a total clueless
newb.

Thanks in advance

Matthew

Better to try

/def -t'(name) kills *' kill_trig = kill $[substr({3},0,-2)]

Lately I've been working on a spellup state tracker that notes when some
of my spells wear off, so that I can recast them when I want with the
touch of a button.  I get no warnings until the first spell wears off,
which gives:

% test: store_spell: warning: argument passing semantics for macros
called as functions haschanged in 4.0.  See '/help functions'.

store_spell is as follows:
 
; Puts a casting onto the stack
/def -E{spellsystem} store_spell = \
  /test ++Spells_Stack_Count %; \
  /return put_array("spellup_cmds",{Spells_Stack_Count},"%{1}")

I've read /help functions over and over, and I'm still not sure what it
is I'm doing wrong.  Can anyone please offer me some advice?  The code
works now, but for the warning.  I don't like warnings...

Thanks in advance,
Chris

It's a harmless warning that only happens the first time you try to call
a macro as a function.  The alternative is to turn warnings off ...

Do you have legal problems?  Do you need legal advice?
It just doesn't make sense to pay some Attorney $200 
or more for just a hour. . . 

Now you can get a whole month's worth of service from
one of the top-rated law firms in your state for much 
less than it costs for your cable TV

/def -t'Bolarn kills ([a-zA-Z \.\,\-]+).' kill_trig = kill %P1

Unfortunatly that is not triggering on the line..

Bolarn kills bob.

Matching has to be explicitly set to use regular expressions, like so:

/def -mregexp -t'([a-zA-Z]+) kills ([a-zA-Z \.\,\-]+).' kill_trig =3D kill =
%P2

and:

/def -mregexp -t'Bolarn kills ([a-zA-Z \.\,\-]+).' kill_trig =3D kill %P1


I believe the above examples will work as expected.

Hi

I am trying to do a simple count from 1 to whatever the first parameter 
on the line is which comes from the 'hints' help page as per:

        /def count = \
            /let i=1%; \
            /while ( i <= %1 ) \
                say %i%; \
                /let i=$[i + 1]%; \
            /done

But whenever i try to execute:

/count 10

It says "1" but then comes back from the actual MUD with "You must wait 
a short while to use a say-like command again." and doesn't finish.

Is there anyway to pause this command between counts?

Thanks in advance.

Peter.

Hi

I am trying to attack a rat and some take 1 hit, some 2 hits and others 
3.  I am using the repeat command to do this as in:

;<------------------------->
;< Auto Kill
;<------------------------->
/def ak = \
    t rat %; \                    ;; Set the target to rat
    1 %; \                         ;; This is so my first attack is not 
delayed by 5 seconds.  "1" is aliased to 'claw rat'(Is there a way to 
use repeat so that first action is not delayed?)
    /repeat -5 %1 1     ;; This is so i can specify how many attacks on 
the command line i want to do.

What i am wondering is whether it is possible to use a trigger to exit 
from the attack.  So once it says I have "slain the rat" it will exit 
and not keep attacking the now dead rat?

Is this possible?

Can someone give me an example of how to implement it?

Is there anyway to include fractions of a second in the delay?

Thanks in Advance

Peter.

One way would be:
;<------------------------->
;< Targetbashing
;<------------------------->
/def tt = settarget t %1 %; /set Target=%1%;get 50 vial from pack
/def at = setalias c %1 \&t
/def cll = \
         /send c %; \
         /def -F -t'You have recovered balance on all limbs.' \
                 balance_wait = \
                         /send c
/def stopc = /undef balance_wait
/def gett = /send get %{Target}
/def -F -t'You have slain*' stopb = \
		/undef balance_wait

Sorry, don't know about the delay.

Im not much of an expert.

That said. here is my soluion

/def ak = t rat %; /def rep_kill_rat = claw rat %%; repeat -5 1
/rep_kill_rat

/det -t'A rat is dead' stop_rep = /def rep_kill_rat = /_echo Stopping
killing the rat

Opviouslt you will need to insert the correct death message in the above
line.  This isnt elegent, in fact its a bit of a hack, but it should get
the job done.

Im sure thers a more elegent solution using loops and variables.. but
like i said my tf triggers arnt that great.

I had to do the same thing. The easiest way is to start with the code of
tick.tf (available in your tf lib dir) and to modify it to suit your
needs.

Hey there,

I have just started using TinyFugue and am very confused... so excuse me if
this question has been asked before.

Is there a way to issue multiple commands to the mud?
For example those of you that have used zMud would put a ; between each
different command.

As it stands right now. If I create a trigger to create food when I am
hungry it would go as follows.

/def -t"You are hungry." food = c cre
/def -t"A Magic Mushroom appears." newfood = get mushroom
/def -t"You get a Magic Mushroom." myfood = eat mushroom

This is nice and all but occasionally my prompt appears before the phrase
"You get a Magic Mushroom." which throws this whole thing to pieces. Thus,
if there is no way to issue multiple commands, is there a way to disregard a
possible prompt line? (prompt looks like this...
 <527hp(527) 270ma 408mv(36230) 1160gp ft: none sp: [commn] > )

Thanks alot,

Brian

If I have a variable that is a string, say
/set myString=thisVariable

and I also have a variable
/set thisVariable=Something else

is there a way to get the value of the "thisVariable" value using the
"myString" variable?

Perhaps an example would make more sense.  I am trying to set up some gear
swapping macroes and I keep certain 'sets' of gear in their own container.
So for example:

/set acContainer=bag
/set hitContainer=urn
/set manaContainer=girdle

so I am going to set up a macro to switch between two sets like so:
/switch ac mana
to switch from my ac gear to my mana gear.

I got this far with the switch macro
/def switch = \
        /echo % switch from %1 to %2 %; \
        /echo % containers: %{1}Container and %{2}Container

and it will echo
% switch from ac to mana
% containers: acContainer and manaContainer

but I am having trouble figuring out how to get the value of acContainer or
manaContainer (or if I even can).  Perhaps using the /test command?

Someone had posted something similar for me earlier, but I have lost many of
my emails, but I had trouble figuring it all out.  So if anyone knows a
simple, or complicated way to do this, could they please share.

Thanks,
M...

p.s. - can someone also post the link for the mailing list archive URL?

Without specifying -m<type>, you get a straight text match - the line has to 
look -exactly- like the text in the " "s.  Read up on matching (mregexp, 
mglob) for some insight.

Easy one: As stated in the "evaluation" help page, you can separate
commands with a %;
So, on the command line you'll to type:
  /eval first command%;second command
In a file you don't need the /eval

You have to use the patterns, either the "basic" globing ones, or the
more advanced regexp ones.
In this case you have to use the regexps for the conditional prompt:
  /def -mregexp -t"^(<[^>]*>)? You are hungry." food = c cre
  
I use here a start-of-the-line ^ to avoid false positives, such as:
  Lamer tells you '<> You are hungry.'

But in other places a simple glob could be used too.
More details in the "patterns" help page.

Waba

Would you be interrested in a tutorial site?
Note that I am a newbie too, so I have the "ability" to see problems =

If so, what sort of stuff would you like me to put there first?

You can use one variable to index another. look at /help eval

The interesting bit is this example:

  command: /def showvar =3D /eval /echo %{1} is %%{%{1}}.
  command: /showvar borg
  output: borg is on.

Hello.  I'm new to the list, though not all that new to TF.  I have two
questions, actually, I know the subject said just one, but anyways here
are my questions. :)
1.  Is it possible to do multiple commands on the command line?  I know
about the %; thing for allowing multiple commands in a macro or trigger,
but is it possible to  perform multiple commands on the actual command
line itself?
2.  I  want to make a triger that would perform a certain action when my
hit points go below a certain level.  So when my hitpoints go less than
500, i want to drink a potion.  I know one way around it, which is this:
/def -t'*HP: 5*' drinkpotion = drink potion
But sometimes a monster will hit for more than 200 hp and if my hp is 600
and a mob hits for 200 damage, my hp goes to 400 or less and the trigger
doesnt go off.  I want a way to where the trigger will evaluate my prompt
each time it shows up and if the prompt says my hp is 500 or less the
trigger will go off and I'll drink the potion.
Did that make sense? :)
thanks alot for any help someone might be able to give.

One way is to change the matching structure to match anything that is les=
s=20
than 500. Use regexps for this:

/def -m regexp -t 'HP: [4-1]?[0-9]?[0-9]x' drinkpotion =3D drink potion

Replace 'x' with something that may appear after the value in HP. Or $ fo=
r the=20
end of line.

The other way would be to use a regexp like this:

/def -m regexp -t 'HP: ([0-9]+)' drinkpotion =3D (something)

Then inside the macro itself, compare the HP to the level that you want. =
I=20
dont know how to do that, though :)

A thiend of mine actually wrote a complete character specific,
gear-switching trigger set for Avatar mud. it should be relativly
similar to what yoiu need.

Ill paste it below

Matthew

;; tiny.gear
;;
;; Contributors:
;;	Harliquen ( khaosse_angel@(NOSPAM)alpha.net.au)
;;
;; Gear change definitions.
;; This has been done in a very complex, but flexible way. Basically,
you
;; define gear and bag sets for each character, and it allows you to
update
;; it without having to change all associated aliases any time you
change
;; a single piece of gear.
;;
;; Usage:
;;	/<current geat set>2<new gear set>
;;	As you can see this is very flexable, as it can take any gear
set
;;	and switch to any other. So long as it knows how. It can do more
;;	than just take all the bits from 1 bag and put them on. There
are
;;	provisions for things it should do before and after wearing and
;;	removing each set of gear. Unfortunatly there is no easy
interface
;;	for this. It uses the following 4 macros when they exist:
;;		/<gear set>_pre_on
;;		/<gear set>_pre_off
;;		/<gear set>_post_on
;;		/<gear set>_post_off
;;	I think their names speak for themselves.
;;	All the gear definitions and additional macros should be set up
in
;;	the individual world files.

That set up the triggers.  Now you gotta make a world specific fail,
loade4d when the world is opened for each character.  This is done using
an addition to your adworld macros.  The last argument is the name/path
of the file.  read help addworld for more information.

Below is a sample file from one of my characters.  It only uses 2 sets
of gear hit and tank, but is capable of as many as you want.

-------
/set main_bag "bodybag"

/set dam_bag "mummified jubal benevolent"
/set dam_light "torch flames"
/set dam_finger1 "ring purity"
/set dam_finger2 "ring purity"
/set dam_neck1 "admiral cape"
/set dam_neck2 "admiral cape"
/set dam_body "silver breast"
/set dam_head "silver dragoncrest"
/set dam_legs "pants flaming"

A little bit ago, someone posted 256 color highlight
information.

I think the idea was bandied about that it could be
added to the Windoze compile. 

Has this been done (for Andy's binaries), or, is this
fairly easy to do if someone wants to compile their
own using Cygwin?

What if you have it set to display your percentage of health?
Would it be:
/def -m regexp -t 'HP: ([0-9]+)%' drinkpotion = /if %p1 < 20 /send drink
potion

asking cause I am not sure about the % (if it needs something
before/after it to read.

In this case, the % in the regular expression is optional, since the other 
soliution will still match the set of digits. The above solution just makes 
it more 'precise', and should still work.

This script will let you stack commands on the command line.

I dont know where I found it, so I dont know who to credit.
Anyways....

Usage:
;cmd1;cmd2;cmd3

The line needs to start with a ';' (without the quotes, of course)

I hope this helps, I use it all the time.

Is it possible to run the Windoze version of tf
completely off a floppy (ie: not 'installing' it on
the system?)

As it stands now, I can only get it to run by actively
installing it, but, I'm going to have access on a
computer where I can't modify any existing files or
configuration (in a uni computer lab), but, I can run
any software on floppy that I like (and will actually
run).

What appears to be the basic minimal files all fit,
but, I don't know how to get it to run and look for
the .tfrc in the primary dir on my disk (instead of
the 'home' dir which won't be configured), and I don't
know if there are any extra dlls or files put in a
system directory during installation.

    As far as I am aware, you can use the equal sign "=" to separate
commands on the command line.  Although, I can't seem to get this to work
properly with the speedwalking and the /alias emulation from tintin.tf

    Makes sense, I also want to do some triggering on the prompt, but have
been too lazy so far to figure it out.  You want to check these helps

http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/help/topics/status_line.html#prompt example
(the " example" should be part of the link, it didn't come out right);
the "prompts" help: http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/help/topics/prompts.html ;
and the /prompt help:

Hope some of this helps, maybe someone else will post a better example for
triggering the prompt.

Whatever...you can use '/sub on' to enable substitution of the '%;' and 
'%\'. That way you can simply type:

/echo test%;/echo test
or
west%;north%;north%;look

As long as all your macro files fit onto that floppy (mine don't), TF should 
run all fine. The program doesn't really need to be 'installed', you can just 
copy a running system onto any computer without difficulties.

The .tfrc file is loaded automagically if placed in the same directory as the 
tf.exe and if named tfrc (simply remove the leading dot '.'). In this directory 
you will need a cygwin-DLL, e.g. cygwinb19.dll or just cygwin1.dll. If you 
like, you can copy the sh.exe from c:\bin to that 

If you generate a batch file for starting TF where you set all required 
environment variables, you shouldn't have any problems. I'll quote my own 
file as an example (assuming TF to reside in a:\tf\ and all macros files in 
a;\tf\tf-lib\).

-------------------
set PATH=%PATH%;a:\tf\
set home=//a/tf/
set tflibdir=//a/tf/tf-lib
REM for NT, setting the DOS box' window size:
mode con lines=55 cols=80
tf -n
-------------------

This is all that has to be done if you are not allowed to 'install' TF onto that 
specific computer.

I see that on my machine Tinyfugue is linked to libncurses.  I know
ncurses supports scrolling windows.  Is anyone with programming
knowledge (this eliminates me, for the meantime) willing to try making
tinyfugue support one-key scrollback, similar to Epic4 and ircII?

Mr. Keys, if you're listening, would you be willing to hack on that and
consider adding it to tf 5?

Sincerely,

I believe it's always been the case that TF5 will have scrolling, as
in an ircII type way. It's on the ChangeLog for 5.0 (or, whatever the
equivalent he posted was.) and I'm sure we'll see that at some point.
I've considered looking at the code to add such support, but it seems
like it would be a pain to rewrite an area like screen display,
especially with TF5 coming out "sometime."
In the mean time, the two suggestions most commonly referred to are
using screen and its builtin scrolling features, which adds quite a
few key strokes admittedly, or using xterm/rxvt and simply scrolling
with that.

May this could be useful for someone out there.
I'm not experienced with tf scripting and would like
comments about could style.

See ya.


----- autotick.tf -----
;;;; Tick counting
;;;; Useful on Diku muds.  To use, just /load this file and add
;;;; something like tick:2 at your status_fields variable.
;;;; The macro tick_action may be changed or undefined.
;;;; You may need edit the command used to toggle mud autotick info.
;;;; And the mud tick info pattern "--> TICK <--".

;;;; usage:
;;; /tick       Toggles tick counting ON/OFF.
;;; /tick <n>   Set the tick length to <n> seconds (default is 30).

   Greetings,

   My name is Dan...

Let me start by telling you a little bit about myself in the
hopes that you will join me and not envy me.


For 21 Years I worked for IBM.  Back in 1996 I left IBM and
started my own company from a spare bedroom in my house. The
company grew and we moved into office space allowing us to
hire many more employees.  At the end of 1999 I sold my
company for over 10 million dollars.


My wife and I, and two dogs, live on a $2,000,000+ Ranch. I
drive a Porsche and my wife drives a BMW.


I have come across something that I feel can help some people
to become better off financially.   This is not a get rich
quick scheme and it does take effort.  Not everyone can do it
because they will not have the motivation.


I am not making any outrageous claims of how much money you
can make per month because to do so is illegal.  The
potential for someone to make good is money is there.


This is not a multi-level-marketing or pyramid scheme.  It
does not take much money to get started.  It does not involve
selling any products. It does not involve buying homes with
no money down. It does not involve investments.  It does NOT
require that you to work at it full time.


I will be sending you a detailed 6 page "Blueprint" of what
to do.  So that I may share with you my discovery,  I'm
going to ask you to take the first step and invest $20 for
something I feel can be a life changing investment.


If you are NOT satisfied with the information I have sent
you I will refund the entire $20.  Simply return the
information I have provided.  Yes, this is a 100% money
back guarantee.


Yours truly,


Dan Nuan

Unimatrix Capital LLC

 Please cut along dotted line and mail this bottom portion to us


O.K. Dan you're on!  I want it!   Rush me my personal copy of
your 6 page Blueprint, but only on the condition I can return if
I am not satisfied. There is no possible way I can lose.  On
those terms, here is my $20.



Your Name: _____________________________________________

For Windows, there is a popular client called "Mudmaster" which has a
peer to peer chat protocol.  "Zchat" is an implementation of the
Mudmaster protocol.

After working a few things out with Mudmaster's author, I wrote a program
which partially (not fully) implements this protocol in Unix C using the
berkeley sockets, and I've tested the functionality so far and it works
quite well with Mudmaster clients.  So far I have it as a stand alone
program I call 'uchat' (for Unix Chat).

I am thinking that maybe this code could be thrown into TF, but I am
unwilling to work on it unless a lot of people want to use it. Is anyone
out there even interested in using Mudmaster/Zchat chat protocol in TF?

I know TF's source has a lot of structures for implementing 'tf sockets'
and other things like that, so am a little concerned on how well I could
fit my code into TF, or if I did as a separate system, to what efficiency
caveats I may have....  Anyone have any thoughts on this?

tf-chat - sounds great for me, especially if there'll be a possibility to
open chat just like a typical MUD-session - with triggers, hooks aliases
and all such stuff avaliable.
So keep on working it'll be VERY usefull.

I've been using a trigger that lets me know when a mob is a mob I should
bother fighting or not:

/def -p1 -wa -mregexp -t" snickers nervously.$" snickers= /echo
-aBCyellow (%PL is ideal)
/def -p1 -wa -mregexp -t" looks a little worried about the idea.$"
worried= /echo -aBCyellow (%PL is ideal)
/def -p1 -wa -mregexp -t" chuckles at the thought of you fighting (.*)"
chuckles= /echo -aBCred (%PL is ideal)
/def -p1 -wa -mregexp -t" should be a fair fight!" fair = /echo
-aBCgreen (%PL is ideal)

When I consider the mob i get:

(The woodsman guard is ideal)
The woodsman guard chuckles at the thought of you fighting him.
(The woodsman guard is ideal)
The woodsman guard chuckles at the thought of you fighting him.

TF's output seems to come up 1st even before the text does.
Is there a way to have TF's text appear BELOW?

The woodsman guard chuckles at the thought of you fighting him.
(The woodsman guard is ideal)
The woodsman guard chuckles at the thought of you fighting him.
(The woodsman guard is ideal)

This counter-intuitive behavior is because there may be other low priority
triggers that could color or gag the triggering text.  TF doesn't know how
(or if) to display the text until all of the triggers have run.

To make your echo appear after the triggering text, you can delay the echo
by 0 seconds, like this:

  /def -p1 -wa -mregexp -t" snickers nervously.$" snickers = \
    /repeat -0 1 /echo -aBCyellow (%PL is ideal)

I think it'd be cool if TinyFugue had better tools for performance
analysis.  I think it'd be cool if I had a better mechanism for
telling what the changes to my client code have on TinyFugue
performance -- rather than waiting til I'm in the middle of combat
with another player to find out that the new code is too laggy :p

Alternatively, does anyone else have any mechanisms or techniques for
analyzing TinyFugue performance?

Hi there.

Im wondering as to the current state of tf for windows.. The only
version I am aware of is using the cygwin dll files to run the compiled
linux exeutable..

What I am considering is the posibility of using VC++ to rewrite the
network and interface code to provide a more stable and windows-friendly
implementation.

I guess what im asking is am I right about the current state of Tf for
windows, and what do people think of this idea.. is it worth doing?

And also does ken have any objections.

Thanks

Matthew Aldridge

I'm trying to make a trigger that first sets a variable to a name, and then 
makes a color macro for that name. My triggers looks something like this:

/alias target /set target %{1} \
     /def -mregexp -PCgreen -F -p2 -t'%{target}'

This doesn't work though. Is there a way to make TF replace %{target} in the 
second line with whatever you set %{target} to?

For example:

target Zard

would make the player Zard appear in green text.

You need a %; to separate the two commands in your trigger - put this
just before the \ at the end of the first line.

/help %;

Are there facilities for this within tf?  A recent convert to
tf has a problem with his cheap home router timing out his telnet
connections.  I'm thinking if I could find a way to send, say, an
AYT signal to the other end on a regular basis I could keep it form
timing out without affecting the idle-time reported by the mud.

Theoreticallly you could do it by writing oe trigger to read the "should
be a fair fight", having it set a variable, then writing another to
trigger on the prompt, if the variable is set..

This will only work if the prompt always comes directly after you
consider the mob.

another alternative would be to use a gag trigger to gag the sauraman is
ideal line, then replace it with sauraman is ideal, or if you wanted to
see both it might be posible (youll have to experiment) to get a gag
trigger to gag then do two things.

         Is there any way to gag the TF program messages that come up on 
the screen every time you run the program?

Mine looks like this:

TinyFugue version 4.0 gamma 1
Copyright (C) 1993 - 1998 Ken Keys (hawkeye@tcp.com)
Type `/help copyright' for more information.
Regexp package is Copyright (c) 1986 by University of Toronto.
Type `/help', `/help topics', or `/help intro' for help.
Type `/quit' to quit tf.

I realize I could gag it line by line, but, I was hoping for one gag to 
work with all of it.

Gwen

The following macro works nicely, EXCEPT when the object being cloned 
includes a '?' as part of the command.

In that case, it drops that attribute from the second object (it doesn't 
copy it), but, it DOES echo it to the screen.

A sample bit of code that's regularly dropped when I use this macro:

MP-CMD [#186]: $mp ?*:@pemit/silent/silent/list
   [setq(0,u(FN-VERIFY,[v(MP-NAMES)]))]%Q0=%N multipages
   ([iter(%Q0,[name(##)])]):
   %N[switch(%0,:,{%b%1},;,{%1},{%bsays%b"%0%1"})];@pemit/silent %#=You
   multipaged ([iter(%Q0,[name(##)])]) with:
   %N[switch(%0,:,{%b%1},;,{%1},{%bsays%b"%0%1"})]

I would assume the ? triggers something in the tf macro language, but, is 
there any way to get around this? I can't *not* set a question mark on 
certain commands, it's too useful in Mush code.

Gag everything, with a higher priority trigger ungagging on the lat line
you want gagged

Heh- i havent tryed it but it should work..  If that stuff isnt
processed before your TFRC

I have a trigger that will cast a shield on everyone who tells me shield, 
however I would like to limit the people that can use it so it should only 
cast the shield if the person is on my list of friends.

Is it possible to check for this in TF, and are there any good ways to handle 
lists?

Using a respeller in a MUD that one of the players made.
The one prob that I had with it was that when i would log out and then
back in, it wouldnt know what spells/skills wore off.  So i made a work
around that SORTA works.
Used this to take the spells/skills and save it into a file:

/def vitaespellvar = /listvar *Spells_Stack* %| /writefile
vitae_spells_vars.tf

Then using his code I just added /vitaespellvar at the end of the part
that stores the spells:

/def -E{spellsystem} store_spell = \
  /test ++Spells_Stack %; \
  /return put_array("Spells_Stack_cmds",{Spells_Stack},"%{1}")%;\
  /vitaespellvar

BUT it never seems to call the /vitaespellvar. I manually do the
/vitaespellvar and it works fine.
I've got the past year and a half of this mailing list on a folder in my
email and i checked for /return and every time I seen it it's been
followed by an /endif.  Is there another way that I can have it work?
Short of adding /vitaespellvar at the end of every spell/skill wearing
off.....

TIA
Jason

Probably you have to change the text to be triggered, or even use a
regexp trigger, but the idea should be clear, I hope.

Hello,

I use tinyfugue on cygwin almost daily. It's really
nice. There are a couple of things that could be
fixed.

One is that in output.c about stuff not working in b18
are mostly irrelevent since b18 is ancient, they can
be removed (and they work now). Also, cygwin now
supports pipes, so that ifdef (in tfio.h) is
irrelevant as well.

Thanks,
Kiran Prakash

Pipes! Almost can't believe it... Can you _please_ give more details about 
the changes you did? Which version of cygwin (btw: complete SDK or only 
the .dll?) is needed to run 'your' TF?

Yes I know, lots of questions, but the TF macros I use are based on pipes 
so that the programmers had to do several awful hacks to get them running 
under cygwin (as of today, some of them unfortunately can't be changed). ;-
) So I am really _extremely_ interested in any information helping me 
compile my own TF to include your and perhaps even other people's 
changes.

Sure. look at the patch.
The originals just had some ifdefs to check for
cygwin, and disable pipes in cygwin, and disable some
terminal codes. and I commented the cygwin specific
"fixes" out.

Anyway, the patch follows. of course, YMMV.

I use cygwin 1.3.12, though any recent cygwin should
suffice. (Btw if you havent used cygwin recently,
Things have changed, its no longer a monolithic file.
get setup.exe, install from internet, and so on.)
Since I compiled it myself, I need gcc, which needs an
installation of cygwin. Dont know if it works with
only the dll. works nicely with cygwin rxvt (without
X) though.

Don't know why this happens, I would think TF checks for gaging lines 
before even sending it to the screen.

Why is it sometimes during lag i'll see the gagged line i'm gagging but 
then it gets erased? gagging lines using something like this

/def -mregexp -ag -F -t'^ ' gag_all

This will gag all lines that start with a space, I do stuff like this to 
temporary gag a bunch of lines then have another trigger to turn it off 
when it hits a certain word or something, good for gaging a range of text.

Thanks! This was exactly what I wanted, and it worked great!

However, I've tried to expand this trigger a bit but failed. Since I add alot 
of people to my "friends" list, two aliases - one for removal and one for 
adding - would help alot.

I'm also using the lists in a queue-trigger to spell up different people. To 
make it complete I need an alias or such that can check a list and give a 
response that can be checked if it's either empty, and if it's not it should 
return the name of the person who's first in the list. With this I can use 
the alias for removing a name after he's spelled up, and continue with the 
next on in the list.

I don't know how easy/hard this might be to do but any help is appreciated :)

I have a function that makes me some graphical menus for me.
Furthermore, it highlites some specified characters also, so that menus'
borders and text insterted can have different colours and such. I created
it so that if a line in menu contains ie. text "enabled" it would make the
word green and all other plain (or as defined). "disabled" would be red.

So the input text gathered together would give a line like (part of a
menu):

| Input Buffer Logging  | disabled | =D8=DEFeat_InputBuffer  |

And the code would search it for special highlited characters and give out
code:

@{BC6}|@{nC7} Input Buffer Logging  @{BC6}|@{nC7} @{nC1}disabled
@{BC6}|@{nC7} @{nC3}=D8@{nC0}=DE@{nC7}Feat_InputBuffer  @{BC6}|@{nC7}

=2E..that would of course make output of (colours can't be seen here
though):

| Input Buffer Logging  | disabled | =D8=DEFeat_InputBuffer  |

and so on. These are automatically created by the function meaning that it
must check the input-string for every character included in my list of
ones that should be highlited. I first had possibility for single
characters to get highlited but I expanded the possibility for words also.
I came up with only one way that sounds reasonable to do this:

-Function takes one should-get-highlited word from my list and in a loop
checks if the output-string contains it. If it does then it adds @{xCyy}
codes into string so that when echoed with -p attribute colours will be
shown.

But this as everything seems so slow. I thought about tf's built in
functions but they would just create more inner-loops though they should
be more effective.

I've recoded this function twice now and it still looks too odd. That's
greatly because I cannot decide which way to go. And to new version of
tf, make commenting the code easier..! Argh, I will always be stuck with
strings and variables.

I'm trying to work out a set of macros that will allow
me to back up MUSH/MUX items I own or control. I'd
like to grab a list of dbref numbers sent to the
screen, and increment through that list, @decompiling
each one to a separate log file.

So, it would look something like this:

/def -p100 -t'TF> Now working with object *' = \
	/log %8.log

/def -p100 -t'TF> Object ready!' = \
	/log -w off %; \

/def -p100 -t'TF DEC DIR> *' = \
	/cd %;\
        /lcd ${LOGDIR}/decomp

/def -p100 -t'TF DEC CHAR> *' = \
	/cd %;\
        /lcd ${LOGDIR}/decomp

/def -p100 -t'TF> Decompile done!'= \
	/relog %;\
	/cd %;\
	/cd ..%;\
	/more on %;\

These above macros already work with another macro,
so, they don't need to be modified -- they're just
here for reference.

/def -p100 -t'TF List> *'= \
<somehow set the list into storage to increment
through>

/decompile <character name>
/send -w @pemit me=TF List> \[search\(%*\)\] 

----
(This is a sample list that that /decompile would
generate:
TF List> #162 #180 #198 #203 #207 #208 #209 #210 #212
#213 #216 #221 #223 #228 #260 #298 #316 #319 #321 #322
#332 #334 #336 #346 #349 #350 #351 #360 #361 #362
---

/send -w @pemit me=TF> Now working with object <insert
#612> , name [edit(name(<insert #612>),\%b,_)];
@decompile <insert #612>; @pemit me=TF> Object ready!}

<wait 2 seconds>
Increment to #180, and then do the above /send again.

After the last object in the list is @decompiled, 

/send -w @pemit me=TF> Decompile done!

I hope this makes sense. If not, I can try to clarify
what I'm looking for.

Gwen

this is no help but i get that, too. i haven't bothered increasing the trigger's
priority, but that might help :)

stuff like this
struct data {
  string : char[20]
  number : longint
}

My main langauge is pascal, and my C is extremely limited in knowledge.

But in TF it doesn't support binary files or structured variables.
So you could do data.string = name and data.number = 456
then tfwrite it.  I'm glad arrays are coming to TF, but I would also 
like to see structured variables it just makes coding much cleaner 
overall and very good for reading writing file data.  I just wrote some 
code that reads and writes 9 lines of data to a file, what a pain to 
have 9 lines ot tfwrite/tfread, it works, but could of been much shorter 
with a structured variable, cutting that 9 tfreads to one.  And less 
likely of making bugs.

By the way how are arrays going to work, just the way variables work now 
they can containe either string or numbers.
By the way I noticed whole numbers are limimted to 2billion this had me 
running around for several hours before I realized the limit was TF and 
not a bug in my code.  So I had to do /test variable = (value from mid) 
* 0.0 to force it to a float.  

Also is the interface going to be text based or graphics.  Reason I ask 
this cause in windows, if you switch to a console you lose flashing ansi 
all together.  

Also will TF scripting have the ability to do any kind of graphics or 
windows or any of that stuff.  If TF is in graphics it would be awesome 
if you could have TF code to open a small window and the upper right 
corner to show special info, it would give a whole new level of 
costimizing,  if it's in text maybe a text window instead.  I can think 
of many uses for this my self.

Thanks

I had people coming to me here and there saying this stuff doesn't work, 
only to find out they're not using the latest version of virtual arrays, 
I use this stuff a lot, one way is to pass data to a function, want to 
pass 1000 values to a function, this is the best way :)
=========================================
;------------------------------------------------------------------------
;Get array / get 2array : A virtual array function to similate a real array
;usage:
;get_array("Array name here", I) & get_2array("array name", I, I2)
;example get_array("Dir_Array", 43) returns the 43rd element from 
"Dir_Stack"
;
;------------------------------------------------------------------------
/def get_array = \
  /return _%1_array_%2

/def get_2array = \
  /return _%1_array_%2_%3

;------------------------------------------------------------------------
;PUT array / put 2array: A virtual array function to similate a real array
;usage:
;put_array("Array name here", I, st) & put_2array("array name", I, I2, st)
;example put_array("Dir_Array", 43, "sw") puts "sw" at element 43 in
;"Dir_Array"
;------------------------------------------------------------------------
/def put_array = \
  /IF (strlen({3}) > 0) \
    /set _%1_array_%2=%3%;\
  /ELSE \
    /unset _%1_array_%2%;\
  /ENDIF%;\

/def put_2array = \
  /IF (strlen({4}) > 0) \
    /set _%1_array_%2_%3=%4%;\
  /ELSE \
    /unset _%1_array_%2_%3%;\
  /ENDIF%;\

;------------------------------------------------------------------------
;PURGE array : Purges a virtual array made by get_array & put_array
;usage:
;purge_array("Array name here")
;example purge_array("Dir_Array"), deletes the whole array from memory
;NOTE: Purge array starts from element 0
;NOTE: this can also purge double demensiond arrays too.
;------------------------------------------------------------------------
/def purge_array = \
  /quote -S /unset `/listvar -s _%1_array_*

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------
;listarray / list2array
;USAGE:
;/listarray array_name <num> & /list2array array_name <num> <num2>
;Will list the whole array of array_name starting from element <num>
;/list2array only lists the second demension from <start>
;--------------------------------------------------------------------------
/def listarray = \
  /test LA_Count := %2 - 1%;\
  /test LA_Element := " "%;\
  /while (strlen(LA_Element) > 0) \
    /test ++LA_Count%;\
    /test LA_Element := get_array({1}, LA_Count)%;\
    /test echo(strcat({1}, "[", LA_Count, "]:=", LA_Element))%;\
  /DONE

/def list2array = \
  /test LA2_Count := -1%;\
  /test LA2_Element := " "%;\
  /while (LA2_Count < 255) \
    /test ++LA2_Count%;\
    /test LA2_Element := get_2array({1}, {2}, LA2_Count)%;\
    /IF (strlen(LA2_Element) > 0) \
      /test echo(strcat({1}, "[", {2}, "][", LA2_Count, "]:=", 
LA2_Element))%;\
    /ENDIF%;\
  /DONE
==================================
Thanks to the people that helped me make the code better.

Some examples:

/test put_array('test_array', 1, 367382)
/test put_array('test_array', 2, 'a string')
/test echo(get_array('test_array', 1))
/test echo(get_array('test_array', 2))

You should see 367382 and a string echoed to your screen.

Passing an array to a function

/def function_array = \
/test array1 := get_array({*}, 1) %;\
/test array2 := get_array({*}, 2) %;\
/test echo(strcat(array1, ':', array2))

/test function_array('test_array')

I didn't test any of this stuff, but what I wrote here is what I have 
done in some of my code. What I wrote here was just some stuff off the 
top of my head real quick.  Hope it helps.
Oh and /listarray is a real good debuging tool, I use this as well. SO 
/listarray test_array should return:
test_array[1]:=367382
test_array[2]:=a string
test_array[3]:=
/listarray only lists up till a blank entry, I thought about using entry 
0 as the # of elements but decided that some people may want to start 
arrays from 0 and not 1. Feel free to modify the code to do so if you 
want :)

I once posted a message here earlier about designing the Mudmaster chat
protocol for the TF client.

I have been busy so I haven't done much other than gronk at the code and
get a feel for how I can blend it into TF.  So far, I have written some of
the basics like opening a chat connection, changing chat names, and
sending text.  Still havn't written answer mode yet.

Anyway, I'll probably be finished before the end of the summer.

I have chosen tf-4.0s ("TinyFugue 4.0 stable") as my version of source to
modify / work with to develop the peer to peer chat protocol on.

So far.

I notice some of you are also using the gamma 1 release.
Before I get too wrapped up in the project, I may want to reconsider my
code base.

Which is the best source I should work with?

There is an argument to each:
for stable:  Use source that is a 'known good' and reliable to launch
your project off of.
for gamma: Use source that is newer and less difficult to integrate for
future versions.

Not really sure (especially since I do not have a clear picture of what
the *differences* between gamma and stable are!).  I'd like to hear Ken's
suggestion on this one the most.  The majority of the work is very
encapsulated in my own chat.h and chat.c files, but I did have to modify
command.c, h, and socket.c and main.c (for the inits and cleanup) and it
probably wouldn't be very hard to throw into the gamma, as it is only a
few lines (countable in one hand, n < 5).

Any ideas, anyone?

It seems to be a common thing (all the other clients are doing it):
1.    MCL ("My Linux Client") has the chat protocol (www.andreasen.org)
2.    MM and MM2k (the original mudmasters)  (www.mud-master.com)
3.    Zchat/Zmud (zuggsoft.com)

I have also heard from a friend of a friend of a friend of someone who
wrote the protocol as a stand alone chat program for Unix.

Hate to sound like I'm following the competition, but since it looks like
this little peer to peer chat protocol thingy is growing in popularity,
the world's best mud client (TF) might as well have it too :)

I could use one of those other clients to solve my chat protocol needs,
but quite simply, those other clients suck :)

Right now I am little skeptical about suggesting my own source end up
being added to the standard version of TF and included in all future
versions (at Ken's discretion of course) mostly because there are a few
vulnerabilities in the protocol that might raise some small concerns.
(It is quite possible to 'spoof' or 'fool' other chatters, or a violent
attack script could generate a great deal of spam, but naturally, even if
you have the protocol, that doesn't mean your forced to use it :))
[ These vulnerabilties are how the protocol was defined and are not a
byproduct of my code or implementation of the protocol]


Sincerely,
A TF Enthusiast


P.S.  Working with the TF source has been a pleasure.  Ken has really
written TF with an elegant and tasteful style.  I encourage others
thinking of playing with the source to have a look at it.  Nicely
commented, too.

Well, since 4.0 stable 1 is newer than 4.0 gamma 3, you should be using
4.0s1 no matter what.

Didn't realize that.  I guess he likes to keep a few older ones on the ftp
site just in case.

Hi,
I dug nearly through the whole docs, but I couldn't find anything. Myabe
you can help me.

I have a regexp on ht prompt hook. It works fine as long as I don't have
anycolors in the prompt. How can I make an regexp work with colors?
Since I don't want to strip colors completely.

thanks in advance,

Daniel Mester

Hi Folks,
some time ago I tried to create 'enhanced' command line for mudding in
a world which has "'&' command concatenation" ('say hi&say ho' would
result in saying hi and, at the next heart beat, saying ho). I wanted
to be able to type "cf orc&cf orc", with "cf" expanded by client (the
mud's alias amount is restricted) to "cast 'firebolt'" in both positions, 
while "say cf ?" should of course be left as it is. With some add-ons
like expanding "5n" to "n#n#n#n#n" the whole thing became very useful 
for on-demand actions. I made a lot of use of recursive techniques and
unless I made something terribly wrong I might have found a bug. *sniff*

This is the relevant part:

/set TEST_STRING=\
01#02#03#04#05#06#07#08#09#10#11#12#13#14#15#16#17#18#19#20#\
21#22#23#24#25#26#27#28#29#30#31#32#33#34#35#36#37#38#39#40#\
41#42#43#44

/def bugtest = /bugtest_recursive_call %TEST_STRING

/def bugtest_recursive_call = \
  /if ( {1} !/ "*#*" ) \
    /test echo({1})%;\
  /else \
    /test (regmatch("#",{1}))%;\
    /test echo({PL})%;\
    /test bugtest_recursive_call({PR},0)%;\
  /endif

Now calling /bugtest will cause an "expression stack overflow, leaving
tf in a buggy state; you will have to /quit and restart it:

(...)
% test: expression stack overflow
% test: function name must be an identifier.
42
% bugtest_recursive_call: expression stack overflow
% bugtest_recursive_call: expression stack overflow

... and then you have to meddle with something like:

% status_int_clock: Internal error at expr.c:377, TinyFugue version
0 stable 
1.  Please report this to the author, and describe what you did.
% stack underflow

Yes, I know, it will be fixed in tf 5.0, but actually I'd be glad 
for a workaround (or just a hint about the right way solving the
problem) or patch right away with tf 4.0. Which is already a neat 
mud client. :)

Thanks,
Adrian

In tinyfugue, smallstr is too short. I've had that buffer overflow in worlds with longish names, or including macro's with longish names.

Memory is cheap, may I suggest changing it to:

tf.h:typedef char smallstr[65];     /* Short buffer */

or even higher?


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, there are some bugs where 'short' is used where attr_t should
be:

With this change, you can use attribute sets of 32 bits. (As I did in
my 256 color patch.) by changing the typedef of attr_t

Yes, this has been fixed in my working version of 5.0, but I'm afraid
I don't know where, and even if I did, the rest of the code has changed
so much that it would be impossible to extract a patch that would apply
to 4.0.  However, this iterative version of the macro does not invoke the
bug, and is more efficient to boot:

/def bugtest_iterative_call = \
  /let text=%1%; \
  /while (regmatch("#", text)) \
    /test echo({PL})%;\
    /let text=%{PR}%;\
  /done%; \
  /test echo(text)

Hi!

I have some problems using /dopath on a telnetd server.

I have some paths with about a hundred directions, and when I execute
the /dopath with this paths, TF sends all the directions commands to the
telnetd server at once, and the server ends droping some of the last
direction commands to reduce flood...

There is some way to send one direction command at a time, wait for the
prompt, and then send the next direction command to the server?

TIA

ivan

/def dirs1 = e%;n%;... etc..
/def dirs2 = more dirs..
/def dirs3 = more dirs..
........
.......
/def dirslast = last dirs...

/def doitall = /repeat -1 1 /dirs1%;\
               /repeat -2 1 /dirs2%;\
               ...............

Its not ideal, but its a hack.

Does anyone know how I can add help pages under the /help system?

I think its roughly stored in tf-lib/tf-help and tf-lib/tf-help.idx
Although if you look at those you can see why I'm asking.

Hi, 

is there a way to add color to variables that show up
on the status_field *without* redefining the
status_field each time the variable is changed?  Ie,
how do I change the color of the contents of a
variable?

-Chad

This is possible (along other things) with a modified TF version
available at http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=34521

The modulename is "tf-40s1"

In this version you can set a "status_attr_xxx" variable similar to
"status_var_xxx".

Example:

/set status_fields "HP:":3 hp:3

/set status_attr_hp=hp>99?'Cgreen':'Cred'

Now if your hitpoints are below 100, they are displayed red, otherwise
green.
You can insert any function in this variable, it just has to return a
string containing the attributes.

Regards,
Jens

Well... I -tried- to make the subject meaningful. :)

Anyways... I have a problem that I can't quite figure out the solution
to, except for a hacky-feeling one. Basically I want to do this:

/def ... BLAHBLAH= \
	blah%; \
	blah%; \
	/def ... BLAHBLAH2= \
		blah2%; \
		blah2%; \
	/def ... BLAHBLAH3= \
		blah3%; \
		blah3%; \
	blah

Now... What that basically means is that on triggering BLAHBLAH I want
the three blah commands executed and BLAHBLAH2 and BLAHBLAH3 triggers
setup, each to execute the 2 blah2 and blah3 commands respectively.

The hassle is, I have no idea how to say 'The /def definition ends
-here-' so that the BLAHBLAH3 /def and the following blah do not become
apart of the BLAHBLAH2 /def.

The one hackyish way that I thought of doing is to turn BLAHBLAH2 and
BLAHBLAH3 into commands so that the above becomes:

/def ... BLAHBLAH2_CMD= \
	/def ... BLAHBLAH2= \
		blah2%; \
		blah2
/def ... BLAHBLAH3_CMD= \
	/def ... BLAHBLAH3= \
		blah3%; \
		blah3
/def ... BLAHBLAH= \
	blah%; \
	blah%; \
	BLAHBLAH2%; \
	BLAHBLAH3%; \
	blah

But that doesn't sit quite right with me. I don't want BLAHBLAH2_CMD and 3
to be there, hanging around all the time. I just want them there to do their
thing if and only if BLAHBLAH is triggered.

Is there a way to achieve what I want to try and achieve. Does the above
make sense? :)

extremely simple: it has to look like this

/def ... BLAHBLAH= \
	blah%; \
	blah%; \
	/def ... BLAHBLAH2= \
		blah2%%; \
		blah2%; \
	/def ... BLAHBLAH3= \
		blah3%%; \
		blah3%; \
	blah


because the single % in %; means that the 'inner' definition is done.

Yes. You can simply add text to the tf-help file. Every chapter should
start with one or more lines consisting of an ampersand with keyword
(&chapter). If you want to be able to search for sections within a
chapter as well, precede the section by a hash with keyword (#section).

The tf-help.idx file is generated automatically. In the TF source you
will find a small program called 'makehelp' which will generate this
reference table. Just type something like
	./makehelp < tf-help > tf-help.idx


Ciao,

Ahhh. Where did you find this little tidbit? Ofcourse, I just looked in
the .tf files for it only -now-. If I had a brain I would've looked there
sooner... ;) But where did you find it?

Actually I don't know, I'm using TF for 7 years now and almost stopped 
coding for it, because I'm only playing one single mud and did all I 
could do there or considered worth being done (regarding TF). But as 
soon as one sees it, it is simply damn obvious ;-)

This is true. I looked at it and went, 'Well, duh...'

K, pretty bored of the /beep :-)
How/can I get TF for Windows to play acutal sounds, like .wav's?
One of my fellow Aardwolfians suggested:
/sys playername c:\dir\sound.wav (or something along those lines. This was
Friday.)
but i get an error that says that it cant find !playername (or something along
those lines. This WAS Friday. ;-) )
even tried
/sys c:\dir\playername.exe c:\dir\sound.wav (errr....u know the rest)

Anyone acutally get this to work?
Would kinda like a victory wav when i finish a quest and not *BEEP* :-)

Try 

/sys start "pathtowav.wav"

That will run it with whatever the registered player is.

Hi,

As a mud coder, I've found getfile/putfile to be a godsend.
Recently, my mud moved to a shinier, faster machine, and
getfile no longer works. I believe the problem is my machine
is too slow in setting up the defs before ed starts spewing
its file to me. I get to see the whole file on my screen,
and by that time the log is just starting. Is there any way
to delay the invocation of ed so my machine can figure all
the defs out? Barring that, is there something else that
anyone here uses (within tf, of course) that would do
the same thing? Copy/paste just doesn't cut it.

thanks,

mike

A quick search for the above line shows this email to be a bad copy of a
rather pathetic scam.  I personally doubt anyone would be dumb enough to
fall for it, especially since it was sent to a mailing list and from a
free web-based email account, but I posted just in case.

A brief look through the mail headers reveals that the message was
received by the list server (tcp.com) from a non-existent domain with an
ip address that does not seem to be assigned to anything.

I have forwarded this mail to guju.net's abuse address, and encourage
others to do the same.  At the very least, we can have this person's
return address shut down and perhaps save some naive member of the public
from being scammed...

But, you can look up who owns that ip address at www.arin.net.

You should also cc the upstream provider, as many of these small isps
do nothing regarding spam complaints, and in far too many cases, have
no abuse address to complain to.

Greetings,
I must admit that I've loved tf for qute a while, have used it since I've=
 been=20
using linux (some 5 years now). The only thing it lacks (IMHO) is MSP=20
support.
When trying to download the (older) MSP.tf file, I find that it just isn'=
t=20
compatible with the new(er) MSP protocol, which supports downloading of=20
sounds et all (not that hard to do).=20
I figured I'd modify it, try to see what I could do to get it to work.

;;!!SOUND(socials/purr1.wav V=3D60 L=3D0 P=3D55 T=3Dsocials=20
U=3Dhttp://dreamless.wolfstream.net/sounds/socials/purr1.wav) is the prot=
ocol=20
needed. In order to process this, I use the following:
/def -ag -mregexp -t"\!\!SOUND\(([_a-zA-Z0-9\./\-]+)( V=3D([0-9]+))?(=20
L=3D([0-9]+))?( P=3D([0-9]+))? \
( T=3D([_a-zA-Z0-9\./\-]+)?(U=3D([_a-zA-Z0-9\./\-]+))?\)" =3D \
That is the best way I've found to do it, HOWEVER, the following error sh=
ows=20
up when that protocol is loaded.
% Loading commands from msp2.tf.
% msp2.tf, lines 24-43: def: regexp error: too many ()
Is there a better way to do this?

----- Original Message -----

   The following is the text of a message sent to a mailing list I am on.
   This seems to be a slightly modified version of a scam being run by a
   bunch of Nigerians targeting people mainly in South Africa. The only
   real
   line of interest in the header is this one:

   Received: from 2mails2833.com ([217.78.76.157]) by tcp.com
   (8.9.0/8.6.10)
   with SMTP id VAA24405 for ; Fri, 9 Aug 2002 21:53:30
   -0700 (PDT)

   The domain name "2mails2833.com" does not seem to resolve and Sam
   Spade
   (http://samspade.org/t/) finds the ip address coming from a private
   network somewhere with no reverse DNS.

   Any assistance or feedback you can give me would be welcome.

Indeed, for the purposes of the curious...   my spam reports went as follows:

:-(
It works.....sorta......
The sound plays BUT it brings the program to the front of the screen and blocks
out the TF window and I have to close or minimize it. And if its played again,
even if minimized, it opens back up and blocks the screen.
I tried it a few different ways to see if maybe there was a way to stop it and
only one other way worked:
/sys cmd /c "c:\ps2.wav"
But the window still popped up and blocked.
I have a program called WatchCat that can hide a window so that it isnt visible
(i use it all the time while at work to mud ;-> ) and that even brings out the
program.
Don't know if this blocking thing is a windows XP thing or what.
I can't test it at work because i dont have a sound card or even a program to
play sounds with.
Question, is there a way to have it play the sounds the way that Windows does
with events?...like empty recycle bin makes a noise but no program comes up?...
If not then i'll just give up and make noises with my mouth :-)
*Quest Fail* = Fart noise from mouth ;-)

This is a hack in a handbasket...  but here are some code snippets
from TF (...src/regexp/regexp.c):

#define FAIL(m) { regerror(m); return(NULL); }

        /* Make an OPEN node, if parenthesized. */
        if (paren) {
                 if (regnpar >= NSUBEXP)
                         FAIL("too many ()");
                 parno = regnpar;
                 regnpar++;
                 ret = regnode(OPEN+parno);
         } else
               ret = NULL;

--------------------------
It looks like regnpar >= NSUBEXP so you getting that error.

In regexp.h,
#define NSUBEXP 10

So it looks like this threshold is 10.

One very dirty move could be to increase this value and possibly remove
the error? :)

There may be another way, but your MSP stuff is harsh on my eyes =)
Maybe someone else can find a more simpler solution by finding a better
way to express the same statement with less ()'s.

Actually, I just took a look and there are either one to many ('s or
one to few )'s.
what I did was highlight the info between and including the ()'s.
This might look confusing but here goes.

Thats it.  on the 12th step you have a ( with no closure.
As a guess, you need to put another ) at the end.
I did it this way because i once ran into the same msg, and i took it part just
like this to find the error

About TSBB
Our featured company OTC BB: TSBB has established a subsidiary 
to meet an unfulfilled need in the market place, specifically financing
and investment banking services for small-and-mid-cap companies. TS&B 
Financial Services, Inc. (TSBFS), previously an in-house Investment 
Banking division, was incorporated as part of a nationwide expansion 
strategy.

TSBB plans, through its subsidiary, to expand the opening of 60 new 
field offices over the next five years. TSBFS currently has offices at 
its headquarters in Orlando, Florida, with sales offices in Little Rock,
Arkansas and Freeport, Illinois and with affiliates in Naples, Florida, 
Tavernier, Florida, and Rapid City, Michigan. TSBBs financial services
subsidiary has established relationships with broker/dealers, investment
funds and consultants, insurance companies, pension funds, underwriters 
and private investors as well as banks to meet clients needs.

The Industry Demand
The financial and investment banking needs of the market are the 
result of both increasingly restrictive lending constraints and 
covenants of financial institutions and an economy that has been in a 
downswing.

Historically banks, made up of commercial and savings institutions, 
were the primary sources of funds in the community for borrowers. 
However, constantly changing tax laws and uncertain economy have 
resulted in the lack of availability of capital from these traditional 
sources for most early stage companies, and sometimes, even seasoned 
companies.

The TSBFS Solution
TSBFS is an organization of seasoned executives with significant 
expertise in professional financial services. The emphasis and overall
objective of the company is to implement their business model through 
which the products and services can be effectively, profitably and 
efficiently delivered to the client.

New Management
As part of the management expansion, Scott R. Neils was named President
and CEO of TSBFS. He also retains his position as CFO of the parent 
company, TS&B Holdings, Inc. "We believe that this is an excellent time 
and opportunity to expand our services. I am very confident in our 
ability to provide high-quality corporate finance and investment banking
services to companies nationwide, while at the same time supporting our
parent company's acquisition model."

Investment Information
TSBB is a company that seems to be at the right place at the right time.
The company will continue to align itself with complimentary acquisition
s. It appears that the industry niche in which this company finds itself
could prove to be very profitable.

Got this piece of code.

/def -mregexp -t"pimpslaps" replace_tf = \
  /test substitute(strcat({PL}, "lays the smackdown on", \
   replace("pimpslaps", "lays the smackdown on", {PR})))

what it does is takes whenever the word pimpslaps shows it replaces it with lays
the smackdown on.
but the problem is that it also strips the line of color.
During a fight the text is normally red, but once I load this code, it turns to
white.
How can i stop it from stripping the color?

thanks in advance,
Jason

I'm assuming that this is merely describing what %P2 happens to be, not
attempting to assign to a builtin variable.

> /set target =3D tolower (%P2)%;

First: the =3D after the space is part of the value being assigned.

/help set

 /set <name>=3D<value>
 /set [<name> [<value>]]

Second: the actual syntax of how it needs to be used.  Tracking this
information down is tricky the first couple of times.  All the various
contexts are initially bewildering.

tolower() is a function.  "/help functions" notes that they are used in
expressions.  "/help substitution" includes:
-----------------------------< cut here >-------------------------------
Expression evaluation.
$[expression]

  The <expression> is evaluated and its string value is substituted in its
  place.  See "expressions".
-----------------------------< cut here >-------------------------------

"--->" for stuff you type, "<---" for stuff coming back.

---> /eval /echo F is "%{F}"
<--- F is "Foo"
---> /sub full
---> /set target=3D$[tolower({F})]
---> /eval /echo target is "%{target}"
<--- target is "foo"

/sub controls substitution.  It's normally off whilst you're at the
command-prompt, which might upset some tests if you're trying to figure
stuff out.  If you want to do a lot of small tests, it can be useful to
have something like the following in your .tfrc:
-----------------------------< cut here >-------------------------------
; From Ken Keys [ESC RETURN turns on substitution for the current line only=
]:
/def -b'^[^M' =3D /sub full%;/dokey newline%;/sub off
-----------------------------< cut here >-------------------------------

HTH,
--=20
As the Irish famine illustrated, it's bad karma to rely on a single crop;
so why do the same with software, especially a product so disease-prone
as Windows?  -- Richard Forno

About TSBB
Our featured company OTC BB: TSBB has established a subsidiary 
to meet an unfulfilled need in the market place, specifically financing
and investment banking services for small-and-mid-cap companies. TS&B 
Financial Services, Inc. (TSBFS), previously an in-house Investment 
Banking division, was incorporated as part of a nationwide expansion 
strategy.

TSBB plans, through its subsidiary, to expand the opening of 60 new 
field offices over the next five years. TSBFS currently has offices at 
its headquarters in Orlando, Florida, with sales offices in Little Rock,
Arkansas and Freeport, Illinois and with affiliates in Naples, Florida, 
Tavernier, Florida, and Rapid City, Michigan. TSBBs financial services
subsidiary has established relationships with broker/dealers, investment
funds and consultants, insurance companies, pension funds, underwriters 
and private investors as well as banks to meet clients needs.

The Industry Demand
The financial and investment banking needs of the market are the 
result of both increasingly restrictive lending constraints and 
covenants of financial institutions and an economy that has been in a 
downswing.

Historically banks, made up of commercial and savings institutions, 
were the primary sources of funds in the community for borrowers. 
However, constantly changing tax laws and uncertain economy have 
resulted in the lack of availability of capital from these traditional 
sources for most early stage companies, and sometimes, even seasoned 
companies.

The TSBFS Solution
TSBFS is an organization of seasoned executives with significant 
expertise in professional financial services. The emphasis and overall
objective of the company is to implement their business model through 
which the products and services can be effectively, profitably and 
efficiently delivered to the client.

New Management
As part of the management expansion, Scott R. Neils was named President
and CEO of TSBFS. He also retains his position as CFO of the parent 
company, TS&B Holdings, Inc. "We believe that this is an excellent time 
and opportunity to expand our services. I am very confident in our 
ability to provide high-quality corporate finance and investment banking
services to companies nationwide, while at the same time supporting our
parent company's acquisition model."

Investment Information
TSBB is a company that seems to be at the right place at the right time.
The company will continue to align itself with complimentary acquisition
s. It appears that the industry niche in which this company finds itself
could prove to be very profitable.

Hi all,

after recompiling WinTF with Cygwin 1.3.12 the problems with pipes etc. 
have gone, but now some other problems show up.
I compiled several different versions of TF with the TERMINAL option (in 
unix/Config) set to termcap, ncurses, ncurses6, and hardcode-ansi.

The new problems I have are concerning colors and keybindings.

In the 'original' WinTF, underlined text was displayed in bold magenta, red 
underlined text in bold red. Any of the above mentioned new versions 
displays every kind of underlined text in plain cyan, regardless of other 
color attributes - does anyone have suggestions how to fix this?

Now for the keybindings: In the termcap and ncurses versions, keybindings 
like /def -BF1 are working fine, the hardcode-ansi version displays only the 
cryptic keycodes like [[[A for F1. The termcap/ncurses versions (which I 
would like to use) unfortunately show a 'misbehaviour' that makes them 
nearly unusable for me. When starting WinTF, there is some scroll from 
loading the .tf macro files. This scroll is re-displayed [1] by these TF 
versions in different (but at the moment not reproducible) situations. It 
seems that the normal MUD output is sent to the background and is 
reappearing when the next line of output arrives. This is not acceptable as it 
is occurring even during fights... ;-)
For this problem I also need some idea how to fix it.

Thanx in advance,
Christian.

[1] Re-display means that the whole page of text shows up immediately, it is 
not scrolling from bottom to top as any other text. With the next line of MUD 
output to be displayed, this 'page' disappears, again without scrolling.

When I gag a line of style:

/def -p0 -ag -mglob -t'gag-catch-text'

I notice when a "gagged" line comes up, although I do not see it, I get
an extra new line.

hmm, maybe more clearly, the line comes up ANYWAY with the effect of
someone having painted over it so that I can't see it.

I can tell when a lot of gag text comes in because I start seeing a lot of
empty new lines.  Is there a simple solution for removing the new lines?

Are you sure you're seeing a blank line in place of the gagged text?  Or
is it possible that the server is sending you the (gagged) text followed
by a blank line for spacing?

If it's the blank line afterwards, maybe you could solve it with a fancy
regexp.. Maybe something like 'gagged$^$'?  Regexes are really NOT my
strong suit..

Oh, I just thought of this - maybe you could make your gag trigger action
set up a one-shot gag, thusly:

  /def -n1 -mglob -ag -t'*' gag_nextline

Anyway, I like that better than my regexp suggestion.  Good luck.

Come to think of it, the server may send a \n\n after the text I want
gagged.  TF is probably gagging the first one but perceiving the second \n
as a different line and therefore it doesn't get gagged/trigger the gag.

Hmm, good point.

I'm not much one for regexps either.

That should work, but may be more "computationally expensive" than what
I would like to see, although realistically its probably not a big deal.

I tried a few bozo attempts of things like
/def -mglob -ag -t'gagtext\n'
and also ^J and ^M instead of \n but TF takes them "literally"
(\n interprets as backslash + n)

Come to think of it, can a trigger or pattern match act outside the scope
of a single new line character?

I was trying to do something similar with another mud client once, and this
is what I found:
      Playnow
      Windows Program to play .wav file on the command line 12Kb

http://www.websitemoneymakers.com/utilities/playnow.zip

then you can either "/sys playnow.exe sound.wav"
or, if you have perl installed, you can use the following perl script:
# playwav.pl
# play a wav sound
system("playnow.exe $ARGV[0]");

then just "/sys perl playwav.pl sound.wav"

I have not implemented using this in my scripts for TF yet, so not sure if
it will work or not, but seems pretty sound (pardon the pun) to me.

Subject Re: Windows TF and Sounds

:-(
It works.....sorta......
The sound plays BUT it brings the program to the front of the screen and
blocks
out the TF window and I have to close or minimize it. And if its played
again,
even if minimized, it opens back up and blocks the screen.
I tried it a few different ways to see if maybe there was a way to stop it
and
only one other way worked:
/sys cmd /c "c:\ps2.wav"
But the window still popped up and blocked.
I have a program called WatchCat that can hide a window so that it isnt
visible
(i use it all the time while at work to mud ;-> ) and that even brings out
the
program.
Don't know if this blocking thing is a windows XP thing or what.
I can't test it at work because i dont have a sound card or even a program
to
play sounds with.
Question, is there a way to have it play the sounds the way that Windows
does
with events?...like empty recycle bin makes a noise but no program comes
up?...
If not then i'll just give up and make noises with my mouth :-)
*Quest Fail* = Fart noise from mouth ;-)

About TSBB
Our featured company OTC BB: TSBB has established a subsidiary 
to meet an unfulfilled need in the market place, specifically financing
and investment banking services for small-and-mid-cap companies. TS&B 
Financial Services, Inc. (TSBFS), previously an in-house Investment 
Banking division, was incorporated as part of a nationwide expansion 
strategy.

TSBB plans, through its subsidiary, to expand the opening of 60 new 
field offices over the next five years. TSBFS currently has offices at 
its headquarters in Orlando, Florida, with sales offices in Little Rock,
Arkansas and Freeport, Illinois and with affiliates in Naples, Florida, 
Tavernier, Florida, and Rapid City, Michigan. TSBBs financial services
subsidiary has established relationships with broker/dealers, investment
funds and consultants, insurance companies, pension funds, underwriters 
and private investors as well as banks to meet clients needs.

The Industry Demand
The financial and investment banking needs of the market are the 
result of both increasingly restrictive lending constraints and 
covenants of financial institutions and an economy that has been in a 
downswing.

Historically banks, made up of commercial and savings institutions, 
were the primary sources of funds in the community for borrowers. 
However, constantly changing tax laws and uncertain economy have 
resulted in the lack of availability of capital from these traditional 
sources for most early stage companies, and sometimes, even seasoned 
companies.

The TSBFS Solution
TSBFS is an organization of seasoned executives with significant 
expertise in professional financial services. The emphasis and overall
objective of the company is to implement their business model through 
which the products and services can be effectively, profitably and 
efficiently delivered to the client.

New Management
As part of the management expansion, Scott R. Neils was named President
and CEO of TSBFS. He also retains his position as CFO of the parent 
company, TS&B Holdings, Inc. "We believe that this is an excellent time 
and opportunity to expand our services. I am very confident in our 
ability to provide high-quality corporate finance and investment banking
services to companies nationwide, while at the same time supporting our
parent company's acquisition model."

Investment Information
TSBB is a company that seems to be at the right place at the right time.
The company will continue to align itself with complimentary acquisition
s. It appears that the industry niche in which this company finds itself
could prove to be very profitable.

When a combat in mud ends, I get a message 'Battle Over.' and I want to
make an autoloot & grave digging if I have set the variable 'i_looter' on.
I put all the stuff into a macro but I'm running into problems with this:

;---- file ----
/set combat_inform	-i -aBCgreen
/set i_looter		on

   /def -i load_settrigs = \
/def %combat_inform -t"Battle over." battleover = \
  /if (i_looter =~ "on") /then loot%; dig grave%; /endif%;\
/def %combat_inform -t"more triggers to come.." moretrigs

  /load_settrigs
;---- ends ----

tf says this: line 102: load_settrigs: unexpected /ENDIF in outer block

What am I doing wrong?

In the definition of battleover you use three seperators '%;' but
already the first one will end the definition of this macro because of
the nesting level. You want to use '%%;' here instead to prevent that:

/def -i load_settrigs = \
	/def %combat_inform -t"Battle over." battleover = \
		/if (i_looter =~ "on") \
			loot%%;\
			dig grave%%;\
			/endif%;\
	/def %combat_inform -t"more triggers to come.." moretrigs


Seperators are nested with extra %-signs just like variables.

Looks to me like you need to escape the %'s in your trigger.
Try:
  /if (i_looter =~ "on") /then loot%%; dig grave%%; /endif%%;\

This seems a little complicated.  How about something like this instead?

/set i_looter 1
/def -F -p10 %combat_inform -E{i_looter} -t'Battle over.' battleover =3D =
\
  loot %; dig grave
/def -F %combat_inform -E{i_looter} -t'Battle over.' battleover2 =3D \
  echo Do this stuff after loot & burial...

Thanks for all the help. The solution was to add %-signs as said (also
after /endif%;\ became /endif%%;\). But for the suggestion:

Why couldn't I just put everything in the end of 'battleover'. Is there a
need to create an additional definion? However, this would seem easier and
better, but I have several flags for different actions (continue killing
into other monster, get corpse instead of looting etc.). So the code would
get long and bad.

Furthermore, is there a way to make (%comat_inform=-i -aCgreen):

/def %combat_inform -t"text" combattrig

...into:

/def -i -aCgreen -t"text" combattrig

...without placing it into a separate macro like I do... Would work of
course by adding /eval into beginning of the row, but then I would need to
make that for every line...

There is rarely a program that really ever gets "100%" finished.  Software
is always in evolution, well, a lot of it is anyway.

If you are interested in TF with chat features (the MM peer-to-peer chat
protocol I posted about earlier), you may download it at:
www.metafocus.net/~tf

I'm getting more busy lately and I'll pick up a lot of the tiny details
later, and maybe setup a few vars /set var=<val> for it when things slow
down a bit.

I consider it stable and practical enough for actual use so thus this
post, but really I could use some more testing and fixing up :)

Enjoy for those of you who need it.

P.S.  Anyone know how to gag an empty line (just "\n") w/out having to
gag * ?

If you mean newlines sent to the server by tf just add an nop command to
your trigger.

/def -t"foo" -mglob t_foo = /test 0


should work

btw. I defined /def nop = /test 0


Have fun

If I have a variable holding the name of a variable, how can I get to the
second variable?

Example:

/set varname=3Drun_someplace
/set run_someplace=3Ddirections to a location

I want to send the directions to the server, referencing it by varname
instead of run_someplace.

Thanks in advance,

Chris Hilts

Tried this over the weekend, but for some reason XP wouldn't LET me associate
wav's with playnow.exe
Very odd. :-(
Never had a problem associating other files, like .tf's to notepad, and others.
Any help?  Like should playnow be in a certain directory?
I downloaded the vbrun file that it needed, even downloaded the other vbruns (i
didnt have any *boggle*)

You shouldn't have to associate the wave files with playnow.exe.  All I did
was place the playnow.exe and the necessary dll's in the same directory as
the mud client and called it that way.  Otherwise, you could:
    /sys path\to\playnow.exe path\to\wave.wav
or something like that.  But as I said, I haven't tried this with TF yet,
but it should work just so.  If you still have problems after this let me
know and I will reinstall TF on this  machine and see if I can get it to
work.

I am trying to write out something that when I am on a particular quest that it
will tell me what the areas are that the mobs are in.
This a portion of my old code (this might not parse well):
/def -F -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) \* The imp*' \
  The_imp=/echo -aBCyellow (The UnderDark)

/def -F -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) \* The prime assassin*' \
  The_prime_assassin=/echo -aBCyellow (The UnderDark)

/def -F -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) \* An Ironroot Treefolk*' \
  An_Ironroot_Treefolk=/echo -aBCyellow (The Land of Dominia, Emerald)

/def -F -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) \* The Carnivorous Plant*' \
  The_Carnivorous_Plant=/echo -aBCyellow (The Land of Dominia, Emerald)

/def -F -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) \* The Horror of Horrors*' \
  The_Horror_of_Horrors =/echo -aBCyellow  (The Land of Dominia, Jet)

/def -F -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) \* The Icatian Priest*' \
  The_Icatian_Priest =/echo -aBCyellow  (The Land of Dominia, Pearl)

Now, this works perfectly as is.  BUT i decided to get fancy and stuff.
This is what I have now:

/def -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) \* (The imp|The prime assassin)*'
\
 Underdark_cp_gq=/echo -aBCyellow (The UnderDark)

/def -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) \* (An Ironroot Treefolk|The
Carnivorous Plant|The Scarwood Hag)*' \
 Dominia_Emerald_cp_gq=/echo -aBCyellow (Dominia, Emerald)

/def -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) \* (The Icatian Priest|The
Preacher|The Serra Angel)*' \
 Dominia_Pearl_cp_gq=/echo -aBCyellow (Dominia, Pearl)

/def -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) \* (The Horror of Horrors)*' \
 Dominia_Jet_cp_gq=/echo -aBCyellow (Dominia, Jet)


I do this to test it:
/trigger You still have to kill 3 * The Icatian Priest
(Dominia, Emerald)

errr...it should be (Dominia, Pearl)
So, I try again:
/trigger You still have to kill 3 * The Icatian Priest
(Coven)
/trigger You still have to kill 3 * The Icatian Priest
(The UnderDark)
/trigger You still have to kill 3 * The Icatian Priest
(Dominia, Jet)

K, i think there is something seriously wrong here.....
I add -F to the Pearl one just to test if that will help:

/trigger You still have to kill 3 * The Icatian Priest
(Dominia, Pearl)
(Dominia, Jet)
/trigger You still have to kill 3 * The Icatian Priest
(Dominia, Pearl)
(The UnderDark)

I say to hell with it and -F them all, and i get the entire list of all the
areas.
Good thing i only went thru 4 areas before testing it.

Oh I was actually wanting to do this to at least keep it organized better
visually:
/def -F -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) \* (\
 The Icatian Priest|\
 The Preacher|\
 The Serra Angel\
 )*' Dominia_Pearl_cp_gq=/echo -aBCyellow (Dominia, Pearl)

And it works but in the same way of:
/trigger You still have to kill 3 * The Icatian Priest
(Dominia, Pearl)
(Dominia, Jet)

Anyone able to help? I have had (|) stuff before and there was never any
problem. But i couldnt find that old code because i decided not to go with it
and deleted it, so i might be missing something. :-(

These all fail because of the * after the ) making that entire thing in parens
optional.  You don't want a trailing * at all.

The actual text that it triggers on is something like this:
You still have to kill 1 * Ursa Major the bear (End of the Dipper).

so thats why i had the * at the end.  I just tried it with (.*) and i havent run
into any problems :-)
/def -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) \* (The imp|The prime assassin)
(.*)'

btw this also DOES work now that I added the (.*):
/def -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) \* (The imp|\
 The prime assassin\
 ) (.*)'
etc

And what I never understand is I post a question and i get an answer before my
question ever shows up for me....
weird...
Got your answer and I nearly ignored it because i thought it was just MY
question :-)

Thanks David!!!!

I am new to this list as well, although I have been using tf for 
probably 6-7 years now. I was wondering if anyone out there has 
successfully installed tf on Mac OS X Jaguar (the new release). I have 
had no problems installing tf on previous versions of X, but this one 
gave me some errors that I'm stumped on. It looked like this:

TinyFugue version 4.0 stable 1
Copyright (C) 1993 - 1999 Ken Keys (hawkeye@tcp.com)
Type `/help copyright' for more information.
Regexp package is Copyright (c) 1986 by University of Toronto.
Type `/help', `/help topics', or `/help intro' for help.
Type `/quit' to quit tf.

dyld: tf Undefined symbols:
_tgetent
_tgetnum
_tgetstr
_tgoto
_tputs
Trace/BPT trap


And then dumped me back into my prompt. I looked in the documentation, 
but didn't see anything about what this may be. Does anyone have any 
ideas? I would really appreciate it. I refuse to mud without tf, so 
this is very frustrating!

Thanks!

There is some difference betwen,

/send open $(/last %path)

and

/send open $[last(%path)]

I just rebuilt it and it worked fine after that.

I've got it built and running on Jaguar.  There are a couple of Terminal
related bugs though.  If you alter the isize to 1, the screen won't update
correctly.   At 2 or 3 it's fine.

Other than that, things are running just fine.

In order to make the installation, I had to make sure that /usr/local/bin
was added to the search path.  Check www.macosxhints.com for directions to
updating the path the old 10.1 structure.

If you have the developer tools installed,  you'll want to sudo tcsh, then
run ./unixmake to build and install it.  If you don't have the developer
tools installed, feel free to email me directly and I'll see about updating
my .pkg of the build and send that to you.  The build that's currently on
VersionTracker isn't Jaguar ready.

One works and the other doesn't?  The second version doesn't work,
because it will provide last with a single argument (the entire
variable contents of `path').

Andy,

Seeing your name reminded me of a question in the back of my mind...  (apart
from your email raising the question of exactly how many plaforms you are
running - lol).

I've used your win32 port of TF for some time now (very happily I might add). 
I've recently got cygwin installed on my new laptop though and before installing
TF on this box it occurred to me that I could maybe have TF running within the
cygwin environment itself.

I was wondering if you (or anybody else) had any pointers for getting TF running
in the cygwin environment.  I don't currently have any of the development tools
installed, so I'd prefer a binary solution if possible (e.g. can your win32
build be rigged to run in the environment simply).

I haven't had time to try it myself yet, so this might all be a stoopid
question, but just wanted to check if it had been done before, if there were any
gotchas etc...

You can in fact run it native, though the build that is currently floating
around is running against an older Cygwin dll, so it probably won't behave
very well within the current version framework.  I can post a more recent
revision this evening.  There have been some changes in the path structure
since that last build of TF for Windows that prevent it from running well in
the new DLL unless it's rebuilt.

As to the platforms, yes, I run several :-)  I've got an OS/2 box
specifically for rebuilding TF for OS/2 as needed, I swtiched to a tiBook
running OS X about a year ago from a Windows XP Dell.  I spent about 8-10
years on Windows as a programmer, and I still write code for Windows, but I
do it from / on a Mac.  Stability, Unix, retaining MS Office compatability,
and it's still simple enough that I can hand it to my wife when she wants to
surf the net.  I've been considering building up RedHat RPM's and
potentially a Solaris package as well, since I have both of those floating
around as well, but I don't see much demand for them, so I haven't.

Andy

Anyone know how to get this to display in colors? (if it can get done)

/def stats = \
  /test echo(pad("",20,"Stats",10))%;\
  /test echo(pad("",20,"------",10))%;\
  /test echo(pad("Exp",20,exp_count,10))%;\
  /test echo(pad("Kills",20,kills_count,10))%;\
  /test echo(pad("Avg Exp",20,avgexp_count,10))%;\

tried:
  /test echo -aBCred(pad("",20,"Stats",10))%;\

andL
  /test -aBCred echo (pad("",20,"Stats",10))%;\

got errors in both.
Reason I want this is not for this exactly, (just had it handy) but because I
want to do this:

1. Gladsheim       2. Pandemonium     3. Hades
 Asgardian Layer    Underground Realm  Oinos Gloom
 Muspelheim Layer    Larva             Niflheim Layer
 Nidavellir Layer    Nightmare         Pluto Layer
  Einheriar          Malephant          Yagnoloth
  Titan                                 Hordling
  Bariaur                               Night Hag
  Per

Basically, the 1st line would be a color, the one with the space would be
another, and the one with 2 spaces would be another...(That is IF the spacing
dont go weird to your view, might wanna copy it into note pad to see it
better)..the problem might arise because under 2. Pandemonium there is only one
single spacing and then starts 2..not sure if it makes sense....this might help
(or u might need note pad again)

0 0 0
1 1 1
1 2 1
1 2 1
2 2 2
2   2
2   2
2   2


Not sure what to do or if it even can be done, but I never cease to be amazed by
what i see this list come up with, so i am sure there might be a way.  maybe set
each up in a variable? and just let the pad() call it? but dont think the color
would come with it...I'll try that in the meantime, will post if it worked :-).
But if someone knows PLEASE let me know :-)

Thanks,
Jason

/help echo

ECHO(<text> [, <attrs> [, <inline> [, <dest>]]])

<text> is obvious
<attrs> in your case "BCred"
<inline> in your case 1
<dest> in your case none

/test echo (pad("",20,"Stats",10), "BCred", 1)


Hope that helped

    I need to send a command to the MUD server, get response and send
another command with part of this response. How can I do this single
thing?

    I tried this way, but ...

/def _test = \
    /eval /def -p0 -mregexp -t'(PATERN)' _trig_test = /set _resp=%%%P1%; \
    /send COMMAND1%; \
    /undef _trig_menjala%; \
    /eval /send COMMAND2 %_resp 

    1) Register trigger for first respose
    2) Send command
    3) Get response 1 and catch it by the trigger 
    4) Deregister trigger
    5) Send second command with catched _resp

    What is wrong here?

Try

/def test = \
    /def -1 -mregexp -t'PATTERN' _trig_test = \
        /send COMMAND2 %%P0%;\
    /send COMMAND1

(Depending on PATTERN and what you want to send back, you perhaps have to
change P0 to P1 or something else.)

Hi,

Anyone ever tried accessing/updating/getting data from a SQL database
in TF?

Just wondering if anyone had tried and done or failed it before I
spent a weekend trying to give it a go.

hmmmmmm
Using an sql database shouldn't be that hard.. For what though? Prefs?=20
Triggers? Worlds? All of that's handled through flatfiles.

I'm not sure what you'd use mysql for in tf, but it should be done easiy=20
enough (system mysql (or if you're like me, and you've got aliases set up=
 for=20
database_connects, use those)), etc.

I was thinking about a player database actually, currently I've got a
program that i wrote in VB, i drag info from the mud, to a text file,
get this vb program to parse it and get various statistical data from
the lot, something that would be more useful to me would be parsing
the data thru triggers into a database and just having a php script on
the front end of a webpage to get my friends/clan members to parse
thru the data as they wish.

The theory could easily be expanded to equipment databases and the
such where the primary problem is always the time spent getting the
information from the mud into a db.

hi,

I have no idea whether this problem has been known because I am new to
the list. I apologize if this is a known problem.

There is a problem with handle_socket_input() in src/socket.c. When=20
tinyfugue receives a TN_WILL, TN_WONT, TN_DO, or TN_DONT which is not
preceeded by a TN_IAC, it will be incorrectly interpreted as a telnet
command. This problem is especially severe for non-us-ascii users; some
special characters will be interpreted as command and a strange NAK of
that false command will be replied, causing problems.

In the following I include a patch that adjusts the braces in the
switch case and fixes this problem. I hope this patch to be applied
soon.

Hey all! I just joined this list. I have absolutely no idea what the 
traffic is like, or even if there is any. Anyway, I have several things.

First, I've been planning for a while to write some tf macros to turn 
TinyFugue into an IRC client. This is purely for fun. Anyway, I was 
just wondering if anybody had some pointers for implementing my own 
world system (i.e. the tf worlds would be servers, and my own world 
system would be the channels), including manipulation of the status bar.

Second, I have some TinyFugue macros I'd like to make available to the 
general public. If I want people to actually take a look at them and 
use them, is my best bet simply to put them on my site and tell you 
guys about it, or what?

Third, TinyFugue has seemed to be at version 4.0 stable 1 for a long 
time now. Is it still being developed at all, or is 4.0 stable 1 the 
final TinyFugue version?

This has already been done at least once. Take a look at

Put it on a website and tell the list about it would be the best way as many 
people object to large posts to the list.

Ken is developing the next version (v 5). He has not yet published a release 
date, so keep an eye on the list.

Ok. I was mainly interested in it simply for the sake of coding it, 
though, as I already use AthenaIRC for doing real IRC stuff.

Personally, I'm HAPPY that TF has been stable. What's with this 
fascination of getting new versions all the time? This isn't Microsoft 
Office, you know :)

I'm grateful TF is stable (ie: doesn't crash). I'd be glad to see new 
versions...because new versions mean new features. Not being technical 
enough to hack the source myself, I'm dependant on the kindness of others 
to update it for me ;).

Hi all,

I've been using TF for a little while but I still can't figure out how to get 
it to scroll text normally into the console's buffer so i can just use the 
console slider to scroll back old text.

I use linux tf and the scroll is only one screenfull long, ever. I want to 
be able to scroll back more than this w/o using the built-in tf command to 
ask for scrolling, which is too clumsy and slow on fast paced combat diku's.

The only option I've found is the variable 'scroll' which is set to 'on' but 
that doesn't have the desired effect. That simply makes tf simulate a 
screenfull of scroll instead of wrapping text from top to bottom of screen.

I've played muds that sent console commands to the user's console to effect a 
non-moving status-line simular tf's split screen, and they scrolled into 
history normally. So I know it's possible.

I just can't figure out how to get tf to do it.

Thanks for any help,
C

I've found it's usually easiest to just switch your term for this - some of
them will add the new text into the scrollback buffer even if it hasn't
'scrolled' off the top yet, and some won't. Eterm with TF doesn't seem do
it. Plain old low-rent xterm, however, does, so just run TF in xterm (make
sure you enable the scrollbar) and voila. konsole seems to work fine, too.

Did you need to do anything special to get buffer scrollback in Konsole 
to work as expected? For me, TF scrolls do not add lines to the 
scrollback buffer, so when I scroll, I get the data from the previous 
app.

Bah, you're right. I use konsole, but don't normally run in /visual mode...
xterm will do scrollback even in /visual mode (I just tested again to make
sure), but konsole doesn't. Sorry about that.

Not having luck getting it up and going.  My OS X is down and I'm forced to 
live with Windows for a bit.  Anyone able to help me figure out how to get 
the paths set up right?

If you're interested in my nifty tf macros, just check out:

<http://kevin.sb.org/tf.html>

The two I have up there are:

/go - actually several macros, but it provides a powerful way to 
save/load paths from one location to another, and even command lists 
(yes, it can save the paths to disk and then reload them later). Read 
the desc on the web page or, even better, in the file itself for more 
information.

/prefix - Allows you to set a prefix/postfix for all the text you send 
to the world (through the input line, I believe /send is unaffected, 
but I don't remember), including an antiprefix for those time when you 
want to say something without the prefix/postfix but you don't want to 
erase them. It can be very useful for doing bulk tasks.

Now remember, these were my first serious macros. I actually did them a 
while ago, but I haven't done anything since then that could be 
released to the public (i.e. anything potentially useful to anybody 
else besides me). If you see improvements that could be made, please 
speak up. Or if you have comments or anything, please tell me.

Hrm, now I still need to get around to writing my own IRC macros for 
TinyFugue, regardless of the existence of others...

Assuming that you use the setup package tf-40s1w.exe from www.druware.com/tf, which uses 
cygwinb19.dll, and installed it to c:\program files\tf, the paths should be HOME=//c/progra~1/tf and 
TFLIBDIR=//c/progra~1/tf/tf-lib.
If you compiled your own TF from the sources using a recent version of Cygwin, you must take into 
account that the path notation rules have changed. For my example above, the correct path would be 
HOME=/cygdrive/c/progra~1/tf, same applies to TFLIBDIR.

If you have Win98, but not 98SE, you will encounter a special difficulty: keybindings to the cursor 
and/or PgUp/Dn keys do not work, you'll have to use the num-block instead. :-/
Another windows-specific problem is that cygwin (b19) didn't support pipes (used e.g. in /sys 
commands) at the time, the setup archive was created.

    How can I set a color prompt by prompt() function?

    Let I have 2 variables (first and second, by example). I can set both in
prompt hook 

    /test prompt("%first %second > ")

    But I can't make first red, by example. How I can do it? How I can add
color attribute to variable? May be possible catch output of echo and put it
in varible, but how?

I play on Aardwolf (http://www.aardwolfmud.org).  I have created a bunch 
of scripts specific to this MUD which could possibly be adapted for use 
on other MUDs, or used as an example of how (not?) to do some things.

Others on Aardwolf have sent me some of their stuff too.  If you're 
interested in seeing the macros, check http://www.birdbrained.org/tf/

A while back, I set up a library for scripts, that I never really 
finished.  But we could easily extend it to be user submission driven 
if there is an interest.

Hey all,
Got this thing that works sorta, and only until recently have i decided to get
it to work correctly. ;-)

/def -mregexp -t'^The administrator tells you \'As a reward, I am giving you
([0-9]+) quest points and ([0-9]+) gold' reward1 =\
/set questgains $[{P1}+2]qp%;/repeat -2 1 /ftreward

/def -F -mregexp -t'^\*\* You gain a bonus (.+) \*\*' reward2 =\
   /set questgains2=+ %P1

/def ftreward =/set questgains3=%{questgains} %{questgains2}%;\
   ft %{questgains3}


The administrator tells you 'As a reward, I am giving you 15 quest points and
310 gold.'
** You gain a bonus practice **
** You gain a bonus train **
** You gain a bonus trivia point! **

You tell your friends: '17qp + trivia point!'

This happens everytime i have 2 or more bonuses. It always reads the last one
and outputs just that one.
I tried extending the /repeat delay to -5 and  -10, and tested it with /trigger
and each time i get the same result: 17qp + trivia point!

Nevermind, got it solved:

/def -mregexp -t'^\*\* You gain (.+) \*\*' reward2 =\
  /set questgains=%{questgains}, %{P1}

Seems to work anyways :-)

Maybe one day i will learn to PRETEND to send a note so that I can figure it out
(3rd time this happened ;->)

Try
    /set questgains2=%P1 %questgains2
instead.

No, there isn't.

I just even tried catching color text with a trigger and dumping it 
into /prompt, but no color got through.

[later]

Ok, it semi-works. You can't echo something from the screen directly 
into the prompt with coloring, but you can parse it (set up the trigger 
appropriately) and set up colors yourself. The way to do colors is as 
follows:

Whenever you want to change the color, put this before it:

$[char(27)][#m

Replace the # with the appropriate number. The numbers are as follows:

    , I've got it. I created this definitions and just using it:

    /test prompt("%RED%first %MAGENTA%second %GREY> ")

    But I thought there was more compatible way :-(

Most MUDs usually have some concept of "space" (rooms) or can be basically
drawn into maps.

Now let's say I have a few "robot" scripts which walk me around and I
traverse the map in this or that fashion until I complete whatever it is I
want done.

I have solved the notion of space by using a "state machine", or basically
have a variable called 'state' which is a number 1..N, and this number
changes as I move from room to room or from phase to phase in my
robot-walk.  When I query the state variable, I can know exactly where I
am at because each room is given a unique state (if a room is visited
twice, it still gets a unique state mostly to describe the order in which
it was visited or to denote time; also it is to prevent looping).

Basically, each state represents a room, and the state machine is used to
traverse the MUD's map.

I have heard of people using "map files", however, where diagrams in
textfiles could be parsed and translated into a set of directions or
states.  Does anyone know anything more about this?  I'm very interested
in using a graphical representation (as opposed to a linear one) to
represent a set of directions.  If there is any already-coded material on
this line of thinking, let's hear about it!! :)

Keep in mind a speedwalk is not what I'm talking about here because my
state machine based on MUD events will often pause, initiate a new script,
and then try to pick up where it left off later (go back to the last
state).  To be frank, everything works perfectly.  The only problem is
that each new map or change to an area I receive, I must make a new/modify
the state layout again and again.  If I could I just submit a new drawing
and have it all interpreted for me (into some kind of linear form), I
could just feed it to an engine that knows how to parse that linear form
and never have to write new scripts for every area.  Updates could be
simplified to the level of textfile diagrams, which is a much more rapid
process.

This line works in a logging script:
           /log -w ${LOGDIR}/$[ftime("%Y-%m-%d",
time())]_decompile_${world_name}.log %;\

This one doesn't:
           /log -w ${DECDIR}/$[ftime("%Y-%m-%d",
time())]_decompile_${world_name}.log %;\

(the only change is to rename 'LOGDIR' to 'DECDIR'
(which is properly set with '/set'.

It gives the error message:
% macro not defined: DECDIR

However, DECDIR *isn't* a macro, it's a variable. if I
type '/set DECDIR', the correct directory comes up,
so, DECDIR is defined. How do I call it in a way that
Tf will recognize?

Variables are read with %{FOO}  ${FOO} is an old thing to pull out
the body of a macro.

I have made much use of the -E parameter to /def in my scripts.  Things
such as
/def -wwolf -E{spellsystem} -t'Trigger here' spellsystem_spellname =3D
recasting info here

are common in some of my scripts.  However, now I'm trying to use more
complex expressions to control whether certain hooks and macros will fire=
.
 I'd like to be able to do something like:

/def -wwolf -E{!posting_note & some_other_var} macroname =3D

but no matter what syntax I use (and I've tried many a different way of
doing this) I've had no luck.  I get % def: illegal macro name "most of
the right side of the expression plus macro name".

I'd also like to be able to use a macro as the expression.

/def -wwolf -E(somemacro) newmacroname =3D /blah blah blah

Any advice would be appreciated.  Thank you.

First, quote the expression.

This works for me:
 /def -E"{foo} & {bar}" -t'hi' fred = /echo MATCH

You can also use "( .... )", but doesn't do much.

You want to evaluate a full macro, for _every_ line received from the
server?  The -E is evaluated _before_ trigger or hook matches.

 /def shotfoot = /result 1
 /def -E'$(/shotfoot)' -t'ho' barney = /echo BANG

Change shotfoot to have "/result 0" and that's disabled.

Ok, now that I've had a chance to test this on a couple of machines and 
had others test it as well, I'd like to release it to the public.

For Mac OS X 10.2, a TinyFugue installer is now available from 
http://www.druware.com/products/oss/tf

We have also updated our OS/2 binary to 4.0s1, and will be releasing 
the updated Cygwin Windows build later this week.  We've got one last 
bug to iron out in the installer.

We are still debating putting together a CD install set for TF with a 
short how-to/scripting tutorial.

Have a set of echoing triggers like this:

/def -F -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) (\
   Cheesethief|\
   Scragg|\
   a terrified rat\
  ) (.*)' Mossflower_Wood_cp_gq =/echo -aBCyellow (Mossflower Wood)

There are quests of a larger sort that have u hunting many mobs in many areas
and rooms.
At times you get either room names or get lucky and get the area name. The above
code will take the mob name and echo the area name. (the one problem is that if
there are mobs with the same names in diff areas but that is not really a
problem at this moment)
Lets take for example, and the real problem with the code, if i get one with
area names.  In this example i'll use Mossflower Wood as the area.

Without the code the mud sends this:
You still have to kill 1 * Cheesethief (Mossflower Wood).
You still have to kill 1 * Scragg (Mossflower Wood).
You still have to kill 1 * a terrified rat (Mossflower Wood).

With the code the output i get is this:
(Mossflower Wood)
You still have to kill 1 * Cheesethief (Mossflower Wood).
(Mossflower Wood)
You still have to kill 1 * Scragg (Mossflower Wood).
(Mossflower Wood)
You still have to kill 1 * a terrified rat (Mossflower Wood).

Pretty redundant.  Is there something that I can do that will tell it to say it
only when is a room name?
Like:

(Mossflower Wood)
You still have to kill 1 * Cheesethief (Room 1).
(Mossflower Wood)
You still have to kill 1 * Scragg (Room 2).
You still have to kill 1 * a terrified rat (Mossflower Wood).

Or a check with all the area names in it and if it hits that it dont echo it?

Sadly since 9 outta 10 mobs move adding the room name after the mob name in the
code wont work.
Unless there was a way to merge the 2 in seperate or the same code. this would
also help in not getting 3 areas for something like "the imp"
Such as:
You still have to kill 1 * (.*) (.*).
and it takes %P1 and %P2 and matches them and /echos the area name?  But i think
this would be a pain to code, tho with the brains out there it's prolly easier
that it seems to me.

TIA

Since you obviously know what the area is, just don't output it if the 
third regex referenced parameter (I always forget the var. Is it $P3? I 
don't remember) matches the area name.

I'll explain how to do it, to code it is another issue.
You create a trigger to look for "^(" this will only work if a "(" starts at the beggining
of a line from what you show here this is the case.

Then use the {*} which returns you all the text on that line.  then use strstr() to get
character position of the ending ")" then use substr to grab the text inbetween the ()
or you can just include the () if you want.
Then store this in a variable called RoomName
Also you need to set a counter I'll give some pseudo code

Get Room Name %;\
Check to see if RoomName is different than last RoomName %;\
If Yes then you're in a new room and you need to reset the counter and Set the RoomName to new name %;\
Increment Counter %;\


You will have a second trigger to look for "You still have to kill"
When you trigger on this the first thing you need to do is
echo out the roomname which you stored in RoomName so something like this.
The Counter will prevent you from echo'ing the roomname more than once in a room.
/If (strlen(RoomName) > 0) & (RoomNameCounter < 2) \
/test echo(RoomName) %;\
/test RoomName := '' %;\
/ENDIF %;\
Then echo {*}

This is very rough code but not that complicated in the end when it's all done
correctly you should see something like

(Mossflower Wood)
You still have to kill 1 * Cheesethief (Mossflower Wood).
You still have to kill 1 * Scragg (Mossflower Wood).
You still have to kill 1 * a terrified rat (Mossflower Wood).

Of course you can make the second trigger strip off the Room Name after the monster
as well.

Actually no the begining of the line does not start with (.
(Mossflower Wood) is what gets echoed, as this line shows:
 ) (.*)' Mossflower_Wood_cp_gq =/echo -aBCyellow (Mossflower Wood)

The mud outputs:
You still have to kill 1 * Cheesethief (Mossflower Wood).
You still have to kill 1 * Scragg (Mossflower Wood).
You still have to kill 1 * a terrified rat (Mossflower Wood).

And *I* output 
(Mossflower Wood)  <-- This is MY echo
You still have to kill 1 * Cheesethief (Mossflower Wood).
(Mossflower Wood)  <-- This is MY echo
You still have to kill 1 * Scragg (Mossflower Wood).
(Mossflower Wood)  <-- This is MY echo
You still have to kill 1 * a terrified rat (Mossflower Wood).

Having the echo is redundant when after the mob name the area name is there
anyway.
What I would like to do is to be able to have it not display the echo if the
area name is after the mob name.

I don't know exactly how it works, but i was thinking of this as i was stumbling
to bed last night at 3am

/def -F -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill (.*) (\
   Cheesethief|\
   Scragg|\
   a terrified rat\
  ) (.*)' Mossflower_Wood_cp_gq = \
    /if statement about %P2 NOT being equal to a list of area names from a list
in a /set, /else \
  /echo -aBCyellow (Mossflower Wood)
    /endif

I am not sure if for the /set of areas (if its even possible) to have something
like this:
/set areas= (\
 Takeda's Warcamp|\
 Mossflower Wood|\
 The Onslaught of Chaos|\
 Arboria)

Ok. This trigger has (Mossflower Wood) hardcoded in. Seeing as that's 
so, I assume all these creatures ONLY show up in Mossflower Wood. This 
means you don't need to compare against a list of areas set in a 
variable, you just need to compare against ONE area.

If you DO need to compare against a list, make the list a RegExp that 
matches like ^(area1|area2|area3|etc)$ and use that as the pattern to 
match against the area/room name you have.

Once again, I receive SPAM which has been sent to the list for
TinyFugue. I am very tired of it. The suggestion has been put forward
before, and I have supported it:

Only allow people who subscribe to the list, to post to it.

This is simple, and it is less inconvenient than having to download, and
delete the SPAM. It is also in line with modern opt-in solutions on all
fronts.

Either that or filter at the server end. I've found Vipul's Razor is
filtering some of the spam out of my tinyfugue mail quite nicely, and I'm
sure that in future it'll catch more than just the odd 75% that it's getting
at the moment.

I'm usually quite opposed to closed-posting lists where they're not needed -
mainly because I run a newsgate service (although not for the tinyfugue
list). For me, it cuts down on a lot of my users duping up lots of mailing
lists.

But if you want a way of killing it dead, yes, closed posting is the obvious
choice. Just if there are any newsgaters on the list, spare a thought for
them :)

Regards,
n.

Agreed, this list is one of the few I subscribe to that does not enforce this
policy.    Fortunately, SpamCop sorts it all out for me anyway...  but it would
be nice to cut it off at the source (so to speak).

What would also be nice is an upgrade to Majordomo 2, which allows neat 
tricks like: Confirm your first posting to the list (ie, moderator doesn't 
have to), and then reconfirm if you don't post for x days.  For spammers, 
they're never going to confirm the post, and thus the mail never makes it 
through.

Hi all,

Well, I'll probably stay on the list this time around.

Anyway, I'm still trying to get my head around all the tf commands, and 
seem to never be able to get my head around it all. Maybe I need to 
develop a full programming mind :)

Anyway, I was just wondering, andI know I need to use /if /def, and 
maybe even /set but how to do it, when I have constantly, changing 
numbers I'm not sure. I'm familiar with %PL and the like, and I don't 
know if that will help me.

Anyways, I play ack muds, which you can define your prompt within the 
game, and have whatever you like in the prompt, reading in the muds 
variables, depedning on the ack version, of where %h is generally hps, 
but hat doesn't matter to tf naturally cos it's internal, and tf just picks it 
up, but no need to stroe it. Anyway, I was wondering if my hps drop 
below a certain level, lets say 6000 if I have 11000 hps, or drop below a 
50% mark, how can I set it up, that I will automatically be healed, when 
ever tf sees the prompt ? Normally I have a prompt like the following, 
but with slight variations, but quite happy to change it depedning on how 
tf handles the trigger.
11283(11283) 6502(6502) -8715 1049/1060 6 pm Snake 1494403

or

11283/11283hp  6502/6502mn -8715 1049/1060 6 pm Snake 
1494403xp

Of course when I gain levels the second hp that I normally have is my 
maximum hp, which I assume will be a variable in itself or something 
assigned with /set, but I gain an unknown amount of hps as I go up a 
level. The mud will normally say something like You gain 20 hp 10 mn 
etc, or something along those lines, I don't remember what exactly, cos 
I won't be levelling for a while.

Also, I also wouldn't mind knowing how to store the current hp in the tf 
script for that particular mud, assuming I can cosntantly write to 
mudname.tf and write /set HPOINTS or soemthing similar in the file, 
and constantly over write the old /set HPOINTS, assuming it's a /set 
variable I need to use in the trigger.

Any help or thoughts would be appreciated, and I wouldn't mind 
something simple, that I might be able to understand, if at all possible.

Yeah I know I don't ask for much *chuckle*

Thanks in advance,

Jono Cooper.

Ok. Here's a quick solution. Change your prompt to simply be the values 
you want, such as

current-hp max-hp current-mana max-mana current-xp xp-to-next-level

etc., each separated by a space, and end it with a defined character 
such as >

Then write a trigger that triggers on any line beginning with a 
sequence of numbers of the same number of numbers as in the prompt, 
ending with >, possibly with text after it. Gag that line.

In the trigger, /set a bunch of variables to those values, such as 
/setting MUD-CURRENT-HP to the first, MUD-MAX-HP to the second, etc. 
Then print out a reformatted version of the prompt however you want 
using those variables, ending with > (or something similar) and the 
rest of the input line after the prompt beyond that. Either that or use 
/prompt to stick your prompt in the input and then print out the rest 
of the line after the input prompt.

If you do this then whenever you see the prompt you have all the values 
stuck in variables in tf, and you can change your prompt from within tf 
without touching the prompt on the MUD (you could even write a script 
that randomly rotates your prompt format :D).

At the end of the prompt trigger you could call another macro that 
examines the values in the variables and makes decisions based on that, 
such as examining MUD-CURRENT-HP and MUD-MAX-HP and healing if the 
current hp is less than 50% of the max hp.

Hope this helps!

    How can I do some delay in trigger?

    I want to do some "action", but after 5 secunds of "sleep". This
"action" may produce the same "trigger string", and I want to have some
time to send my commands between trigger results.

I just wanted to check the status of the latest Cygwin binary of Tf. At the 
site, it says it's still the older version. Are you still having trouble 
with the installer?

Also, do the assorted binaries include the 265-color patch that was posted 
here many moons ago? I'm interested in Mac OS X and Windows, specifically.

I'm asking on the list so that other users of these versions can be updated 
at the same time :).

Hi all,

It's probably me, but I'm having one of those, "nothing ever works"
days with TF. I've tried a variety of ways to do this, including
stealing similiar code from my other scripts with no luck :(

I'm looking to timestamp the a specific event and store the time in a
variable as a fixed number (so in 10 minutes, the contents of the var
will still be the time 10 minutes ago). The eventual result will take
the timestamps from two different points and get the time elapsed
between them.

Any help on how to set the variable a time value.

Thanks

-Craig

/set foo=$[time()]

you can use it later using ftime

like /echo $[ftime("%C", foo)]

I just noticed this and don't know how to fix it. When I type /time in 
TF its always one hour behind the time in windows.

Windows time is correct.  Anyone ever experience this and know how to 
fix it.

I'm getting the feeling that the echo below does not print out the
beginning spaces of P1 because tf parses all the args to /echo as a
whole and THEN splits them, rather then doing the split before parsing.

Am I right? Is there any way around it? Please note that whilst using
/test echo("%%%{P1}",...) does get around this, it has an issue with
quotes being present in P1. :/

Anyone able to help? ATM I'm using a | before the %%%{P1} but that's not
really adequate. :/

            /echo -wx - %%%{P1}                                

Also, is there a simpler way to do that regexp /def? Remember that
preceding spaces/tabs HAVE to be kept.

It works fine in Mac OS X. Maybe your shell environment is set wrong? 
(I don't know windows, though, so that could be completely missing the 
mark)

replace /echo -wx - %%%{P1} with:
/test echo(- %%%{P1}, , , "wx")

That should work if I understood /help echo correctly.

This is a problem with the Win32 binary. It's not just you :).

As near as I can tell, it does the DST (Daylight Savings Time) shift a 
couple weeks early, because, it will suddenly be off by an hour for about 2 
weeks, DST will shift, and then it will be correct, again.

I haven't found any way to fix it. You could try talking to Andy Satori and 
see if this is a fix he could do, or, if it's a deeper problem than that.

Wish it did but it creates more errors. As I said above, the problem
with using the function is similar to using the command. All the args
get parsed as one it seems and then split up because quotation marks in
P1 break the quotation of the first argument, resulting in an error. 

I've been trying to think of some way around this but still can't. :/

The universe is a bastid. :)

Right after posting this I read the hints help file and came up with
this:

/test echo({P1}, 'n', 'off', 'wx')

And it works great. :)

Hello, tinyfugue users,

    When I use tinygugue to connect to multi-byte mud, for example chinese
mud, it can't display the charaters correctly.
    The local (including LC_CTYPE, LC_TIME and LANG)is set to zh_CN.gb2312
automatically, it is no problem. And I also have set istrip to off.
    I can't find any more help from on-line help file. What should I do?
    Thanks in advance!

Best Regards,
Denver

Hi all,

I'm looking for tf patches... I remember there was an high color patch
for xterm, an msp patch and a mccp patch but i can't find them in the
net.

Does anybody still have those patches or other patches ?

Bastian

Can I make a trigger which will match all output from tinyfugue, as oppos=
ed to=20
output from the world I'm connected to? I'd like to make all tf output=20
(including help messages, error messages, "activity in world" messages et=
c)=20
in a different colour, but I can't see a way to do this other than making=
 a=20
hook that matches every event, and even then I'm not sure that that cover=
s=20
everything. Is there a way to do this?

    mccp compression patch. I didn't try use compression 1.0, but 2.0 worked
fine.

+ *
+ * mc_state is an opaque type representing the current compression state of
+ * a connection. You should include a (mc_state *) in the information you
+ * store for a server connection.
+ *
+ * Initialization / cleanup:
+ *
+ *   When a connection is initiated, call mudcompress_new, and store the
+ *   resulting pointer in your server connection information. This pointer=
 is
+ *   used as a handle for all other functions. This does NOT begin compres=
sion
+ *   - it just initialises various internal structures.
+ *
+ *   When a connection is terminated, call mudcompress_delete with the han=
dle
+ *   to delete all memory allocated by the decompressor for the connection.
+ *
+ * Reading / writing:
+ *
+ *   Reading from the server connection must go through the decompressor at
+ *   all times. The decompressor handles both negotiation and decompression
+ *   transparently - it receives input directly from the server, then prov=
ides
+ *   the main client code with decompressed data, hiding all protocol deta=
ils.
+ *
+ *   When data is received from the mud server, call mudcompress_receive,
+ *   passing it the handle for the connection, a pointer to the data read,
+ *   and the length of data read. It is VITAL that ALL data read is passed
+ *   to the decompressor - including data with embedded NULs!
+ *
+ *   After mudcompress_receive has been called, call mudcompress_pending()=
 to
+ *   see if any decompressed data is available. It returns the number of
+ *   bytes pending.
+ *
+ *   If there is pending data waiting, call mudcompress_get to retrieve it.
+ *   This fills up to "size" bytes in the provided buffer "buf", and retur=
ns
+ *   the number of bytes copied. Your client can now process this data as =
if
+ *   it had been directly read from the server.
+ *
+ *   Be sure to check mudcompress_pending again after calling mudcompress_=
get!
+ *   Removing some data from the decompress buffer may have allowed the
+ *   decompressor to decompress some more data - in which case, you want to
+ *   process it immediately, rather than waiting for another read from the
+ *   mud server.
+ *
+ *   Regularly call mudcompress_response. If non-NULL, you need to write t=
he
+ *   returned string to the mud server. This is needed when the decompress=
or
+ *   is negotiating compression with the server. When called,
+ *   mudcompress_response clears any pending string, so be sure to save its
+ *   return value!
+ *
+ * Status information:
+ *
+ *   mudcompress_error returns non-0 if there has been a (fatal) decompres=
sion
+ *   error. In this case, all you can do is tell the user that something w=
ent
+ *   wrong and close the connection.
+ *
+ *   mudcompress_stats fills in the two (unsigned long *) values passed, w=
ith
+ *   the number of compressed bytes read, and the number of bytes that they
+ *   decompressed to.
+ *
+ *   mudcompress_compressing returns non-0 if the connection is currently
+ *   using compression.

I've used tinyfugue for nine years. I have some comments/questions, but 
I'd like to check the list archives before harassing you folks. Is there 
such a creature?

TIA,
Chris

Just installed tinyfugue for windows, and I notice that I can't use the 
tab key to get past the more prompt.

% dokey: No editing function page

is what happens if I press tab.

Can anyone help me re-gain tab functionality?

many thanks!!

   /def -ag -mregexp -t'^.*' cwho_catchline = \

This way to date is the only way I know how to do this correctly, this 
includes matching blank lines
lines with text.  I use P0.

Problem with other methods I tried is something gets left out, either a 
blankline gets skipped, leading spaces removed or what ever and
its anoying to always see the stupid warning:
% def: Warning: leading ".*" in a regexp is very inefficient, and never 
necessary.

Well if it's never neccessary tell me how to do it another way.

This warning should be removed from TF anyway, I think this was good 
back in the day when people were using
machines running at 90mhz :)

What would happen if you defined it simply as -t'^' ?

> No, there's no way to do this, not even in 5.0 (unreleased).

May I suggest a "yet"? It should be no hardest rocket engineering
to support some configurable color settings for

- tf warnings (e.g. 'warning: "%#" substitution in expression is
  legal, but can be confusing. ...')

- tf messages (e.g. 'Activity in world foo')

- tf error messages (e.g. 'load: secret_garden.tf: No such file or
  directory')

Of course this could be enhanced quite a lot, e.g. the posibility to 
assign different colors to different hook events...? 

Of the other hand, nobody (except Ken, who maybe IS Terence Hill ;))
knows what 5.0 is coming around with... 

*ponder*

The trigger
    /def -mregexp -t'^'
matches all lines that have a beginning.  I.e., all lines.
If it's not working for you, perhaps you still have some other matching
trigger of equal or higher priority getting in the way.
BTW, the entire text of the line, including leading and trailing spaces,
is available via the %{PR} substitution within the body of that macro.

When I said -t'^', I relaly meant /def -ag -mregexp -t'^' 
cwho_catchline = \

I was just abbreviating.

Just use the rand() function in get_array
so like /test value := get_array("Your_Array", rand(1,10))
This would do what you want in this example it would retirve something 1 
to 10.

No, there's no way to do this, not even in 5.0 (unreleased).
Hooks do not cover everything.

You might try the reverse, though:  set your terminal's default color
to the color you want tf output to be, and use a high priority fallthru
"*" trigger to color all mud text the way you want it.  You can also
set the status_attr variable to the color you want the status bar to be.
Text in your input window, however, will be the same color as the tf
output; there's no way to change that.

Sorry, but tf does not support multibyte character sets.  Its locale support
is limited to 8 bit characters.

Sorry to have to send this to the list, but, all attempts to contact Galvin 
off-list have resulted in no response (which I'm going to assume means that 
he doesn't read those mailing addresses anymore).

Galvin (or other members of the list who like these sort of challenges),

Have you ever considered writing an add-on to your array package that 
allows users to grab a random entry from the array elements? I know *I* 
would find it incredibly useful (which is why I'm asking, of course ;)), 
but, I suspect that it might be of use to other people, also.

;;; You may store anything to be abbreviated in these lists, e.g. weapons,
;;; friends, npcs, scores etc.
;;;
;;; If you use text not containing other characters than letters, numbers and _

;;; e.g. /set_array weapon s1 sword_with_a_very_long_id
;;;
;;; /def wield = /get_array weapon %1%;wield %?
;;;
;;; Usage:
;;; instead of: wield sword_with_a_very_long_id
;;; just use: /wield s1
;;;
;;; Some Examples:
;;; /test put_array('test_array', 1, 367382)
;;; /test put_array('test_array', 2, 'a string')
;;; /test echo(get_array('test_array', 1))
;;; /test echo(get_array('test_array', 2))
;;;
;;; You should see 367382 and a string echoed to your screen.

;;; /test array2 := get_array({*}, 2) %;\
;;; /test echo(strcat(array1, ':', array2))
;;;
;;; /test function_array('test_array')
;;;
;;; What I wrote here was just some stuff off the top of my head real 
quick.  Hope it helps.
;;; Oh and /listarray is a real good debugging tool, I use this as well. SO 
/listarray test_array should return:
;;; test_array[1]:=367382
;;; test_array[2]:=a string
;;; test_array[3]:=
;;;
;;; /listarray only lists up till a blank entry, I thought about using 
entry 0 as the # of elements but decided that some people may want to start 
arrays from 0 and not 1.

Is this a planned improvement in the (as yet unreleased) tf 5.0?

That works if you have one array, or, multiple arrays with the same number 
of elements in each.

Here's what I'm doing:

I have a collection of silly teeshirt phrases that I use across different 
worlds. They vary by my character's interest on each world (one is 
music-oriented, one is language-oriented, another is fashion and shopping 
-oriented, etc).

Each time I connect to those worlds, I'd like their teeshirts to update 
with a random element from the array.

This works in test code this way:

/def -p3 -F -1 -w -h"CONNECT" tee_connect_hook = \
         /test tee_value := send(get_array('${world_name}_tee',rand(0,7)))

The arrays are named <worldname>_tee, and each one has a different number 
of elements. The longest has 15 phrases, the shortest has 8. Using a 
straight rand() call won't work across these various arrays, as I need a 
function that will count the number of elements in the array, and then 
return a random number based on the results. Each array starts with 0 as 
its first element.

Ok here it is two new functions now quite what you wanted, but this will 
be more useful to everyone.
;--------------------------------------------------------------------------
;GET array count / GET 2array count
;usage:
;get_array_count("Array name here", start)
;get_2array_count("Array name here", index, start)
;
;NOTE:
;These will count the number of elements starting at "start" till the first
;empty element.
;Get_array2_count will count the number of elements starting at index
;from "start"
;--------------------------------------------------------------------------
;/def get_array_count = \
;  /test GA_Name := {1} %;\
;  /test GA_Count := {2} - 1 %;\
;  /test GA_Element := " " %;\
;  /while (strlen(GA_Element) > 0) \
;    /test ++GA_Count %;\
;    /test GA_Element := get_array(GA_Name, GA_Count) %;\
;  /DONE %;\
;  /return GA_Count - 1

;/def get_2array_count = \
;  /test GA2_Name := {1} %;\
;  /test GA2_Index := {2} %;\
;  /test GA2_Count := {3} -1 %;\
;  /test GA2_Element := " " %;\
;  /while (strlen(GA2_Element) > 0) \
;     /test ++GA2_Count %;\
;     /test GA2_Element := get_2array(GA2_Name, GA2_Index, GA2_Count) %;\
;  /DONE %;\
;  /return GA2_Count - 1

Some example
/test put_array('halloween', 1, 'skeleton')
/test put_array('halloween', 2, 'owls')
/test put_array('halloween, 3, 'boo!')

/test echo(get_array_count('halloween', 1))
returns 3
/test echo(get_array_count('halloween', 2))
returns 2

/test put_2array('double', 1, 1 , 'hmm')
/test put_2array('double, 1, 2, 'burp!')
/test put_2array('double, 1, 3, 'damn')
/test echo(get_2array_count('double', 1, 1)
returns 3
Now for it to work in your stuff
;/def -p3 -F -1 -w -h"CONNECT" tee_connect_hook = \
;        /test tee_value_r := get_array_count('${world_name}_tee', 0) %;\
;        /test tee_value := 
send(get_array('${world_name}_tee',rand(0,tee_value_r)))
I count from 0 since you had rand 0 in there, if not then count from 1 
in get array count.

There is no way the arrays can have a built in counter since some people 
can put stuff in arrays
out of order, and for it to do a whole count every time someone does a 
put_array would
have huge overhead.
I never had a need for this, well now its all coded up and ready to use, 
I tested both the functions.
So they work.

I need to /send a string to the mud I'm on.  The string is this:
 
H:$h/$H S:$s/$S M:$m/$M C:$c/$C X:$x% $e.
 
These are not macros, but TinyFugue keeps interpreting it as a macro.  How do
I stop that?

Also make sure that %sub is off, if you're sending this from the command
line.

And it's more than likely MY fault:
Just to cut it short, I have a trigger set to go off on this:

You still have to kill 1 * the bear (Dark Forest)

With the out put of just showing me the area name like this:

(The Mirror Realm Evil)
You still have to kill 1 * the bear (Dark Forest)

There are many rooms in the area so i did this:

//def -F -mregexp -t'^You still have to kill [0-9]+ \* [A-Za-z0-9]+ \(\
   Dark Forest|\
   The Path|\
   Street|\
   The Sorcery|\
   The Street|\
   The Swamp|\
   The Temple|\
  \)' The_Mirror_Realm_evil_cp_gq =/echo -aBCyellow (The Mirror Realm Evil)

What is happening is if i walk into a room with those words in it i get:
(The Mirror Realm Evil)
The Temple Of Mota (G) (2133)

(The Mirror Realm Evil)
The Temple Square (G) (2133)

(The Mirror Realm Evil)
Sapphire Street (2085)

I even got this one (fun fun):
(The River of Despair)
(The Mirror Realm)
(Ancient Greece - Bandit's camp)
(The Mirror Realm Evil)
The Path (2122)

As far as I can tell, the trigger is TOTALLY bypassing:
^You still have to kill [0-9]+ \* [A-Za-z0-9]+ \(\
and just reading the stuff between

I have a couple of questions:

First, is it possible to get sub-second information from tinyfugue?  I'd
most like it for the /time command, as I'd like to see the exact timing of
some events that are only a few seconds apart.

Second, is it possible to have tinyfugue communicate with other programs?
I'm thinking specifically of Selim's Magic Mapper, which is a very good
mapping program, but less good as a MUD client.  Mostly, I'd like
tinyfugue to be able to report movement to smm so that its map tracks my
actual position.

In 4.0, /recall -t%T.%. will give you 100ths of a second precision for
history, but you can't use sub-second precision in anything else.

5.0 has sub-second precision for everything.  Too bad it's not in wide
release yet.

Little error in the 4.0 stable 1 docs. It should say strftime() rather 
than ftime() in /help time. You could type man 3 strftime from a shell 
prompt to get the formatting info. It doesn't support what you want, 
unfortunately.

Large tomes have been composed regarding the subject of inter process 
communications. A quick and easy way would be to use some temporary file 
scheme. Performance shouldn't be bad either, since the stuff will probably
be in a cache somewhere when you want it, if you don't wait too long.

Our modified TF at tf-macros.sf.net has a function mstime() which gives
you 1/1000 seconds (along with a md5-function, dynamic colors in zthe
status bar and other things).

I think the best way to communicate with other processes from TF are TCP
sockets.
If the process, you want to communicate with, doesn't support sockets,
yout could write some sort of little wrapper programm.

In the moment this is a project by German developers, mostly vom the
German MUD Morgengrauen. This is the main reason, why most of the
documentation is in German.
If there is interest from other people, an English documentation could
be considered.

The project has two main parts. Part 1 are TF macros for just any pupose
(a way system, combat stuff, keybindings, encrypted communication). We
try to split this into MUD dependend stuff (in the directory mg.mud.de)
and MUD independet stuff (top directory).
The TF macros are in the CVS module "Version".

The second part (stated by me) is a patched version of TF itself (cvs
module: tf-40s1).
I started it because I was frustated of waiting for TF5 and I didn't
like Kens handling ob bug reports (answers like "this is fixed/available
in TF5" are completely useless, when TF5 is not available).
The patched TF aims two goals: speedup and new features. Current
modifications are:

New functions:
string md5(string) -> calculates md5 digest of string. Used as general
hash and checksum function by various macros

int mstime() -> returns the milliseconds passed since the beginning of
the day. Used for timing and speed evaluation.

string regcomp(string) -> precompiles a regexp and returns a token for
it. this token can be used in regmatch() like a normal regexp. =>
speedup for regmatch.
regfree(string) -> frees the space allocated by a precompiled regexp.
the token cannot be used any more.

/help works for all new functions and returns the normal usage
description.

Other modifications:
The strstr macro has been removed and strstr is now an internal TF
function whichs is abount 7 times faster on my system. There is still a
macro wrapper for strstr so that /strstr works too (compatibility).

async_read: its now possivble to enable keyboard reading from
asynchronous macros (triggers). Wee needet this feature.

status_color:
There are new special variables for the status bar. They are called
status_attr_NAME and work similar to status_var_NAME. Bur the do not
determine the output of the variable but its display attributes.
Lets say you have your hitpoints in the statusbar in a variable called
hp.

/set status_fields="Hitpoints:":10 hp:3

Now you could do something like:

/set status_attr_hp=hp>100?'Cgreen':'Cred'

If your hp are above 100, they will be displayed green, if they fall
below 101, they will be displayed red. The attribute in status_fields is
ignored if this special variable is set (but only for this speciefic
variable).

The last thing was something with error parsing, but Michael Hunger can
explain this better than me.

If anyone is interested in working on the tf-source, please contact me
or Michael.

I will put this email at the project homepage, becau I think I've never
written down a documentation of the changes before.

Hi!

I've just joined the list, hoping to gain some insite into
triggers/macros.  I've perused through the docs on this, and tried
things similar to the examples in the docs, but haven't had much success
just yet.  Perhaps, there is an archive to this list I could browse
through, to see if I can find more examples to follow?  I seem to do
well learning with a stack of examples...

thanks for any help!

/recall works, since I can just let things happen, then check the timing.
Setting a trigger with /time would be more convenient, though.

I checked the tf website (<http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/>) and only found
mention of version 4.0.  Where would I find 5.0?  Am I even looking at the
correct website?

For examples one of the best things to do is go to the list's archive site:
http://www.cutery.fi/archive.php?list=tf

Also, do a search on google for TF macros.  i got a few links that helped me
from there.

By "not in wide release yet" it means you can't get it yet.

Last release I find mentioned in the archives,

From    Ken Keys 
Date    1999-03-07 23:42
Subject TinyFugue 4.0 stable 1 released

And I've seen quite a few answers from Ken that says "This has been fixed in
the the coming 5.0 release."

Dont you think its time to lets us try a gamma/beta version and bugreport? I
realize this is a personal project but since we already have announced forks
here on the list, wouldnt it be nice to share the changes you've made and
perhaps get some feedback?

okay, so I'm very new to TF, but I've been pouring over docs and the
mailing list archive, and hacking through this little bit of script for
the better part of my day, and since my head is hurting pretty well now,
I'm going to grovel and hope some help comes my way :)

I've got the following text coming in from the mud:

-------------------------
Kat@#twinmoon is now relaying messages from this chat room.
-------------------------

I've got the following trigger to work:

-------------------------
/def -ah -mglob -t"{*@#twinmoon} is now relaying messages from this chat
room." welcome_relay = say Welcome to Twinmoon Odysseys, %1!
-------------------------

and output the following to the mud:

-------------------------
say Welcome to Twinmoon Odysseys, Kat@#twinmoon!
-------------------------

This is neat, but I'd like to cut '@#twinmoon' out of %1.  I've tried
things like changing the trigger to be:

-------------------------
/def -ah -mglob -t"{*@#twinmoon} is now relaying messages from this chat
room." welcome_relay = say Welcome to Twinmoon Odysseys,
replace("@#twinmoon", "", %1)!
-------------------------

or....

-------------------------
/def -ah -mglob -t"{*@#twinmoon} is now relaying messages from this chat
room." welcome_relay = say Welcome to Twinmoon Odysseys,
/replace("@#twinmoon", "", %1)!
-------------------------

or...

-------------------------
/def -ah -mglob -t"{*@#twinmoon} is now relaying messages from this chat
room." welcome_relay = /test echo "say Welcome to Twinmoon Odysseys,
replace("@#twinmoon", "", %1)!" w
-------------------------

and a few others (I'll stop spamming the list with all of my
incantations now).  None of them seem to quite do the trick for me...

Anyone know of the simple answer that I just can't seem to find today?

thanks!!

This is how I'd do it:
/def -ah -mregexp -t"@#twinmoon is now relaying messages from this chat
 room." welcome_relay = say Welcome to Twinmoon Odysseys, %PL!

The variable %PL contains everything to the left (before) the start of
the pattern, which will be the name, e.g. "Kat".

> I've tried things like changing the trigger to be:

You need the replace(...) clause to be evaluated as an expression -- which
will happen if you enclose it within a $[].
This should work if you say {1} instead of %1.  Alternatively, you
could use "%1" instead of %1 for the third argument, but that's bad form,
and if you have %pedantic turned on it will say so:
say Welcome to Twinmoon Odysseys, $[replace("@#twinmoon", "", {1})]!

> or....
> /def -ah -mglob -t"{*@#twinmoon} is now relaying messages from this chat
> room." welcome_relay = say Welcome to Twinmoon Odysseys,
> /replace("@#twinmoon", "", %1)!
> -------------------------

Or you can call a macro by enclosing it in $() -- but macros don't enclose
their arguments in parentheses (and commas):
say Welcome to Twinmoon Odysseys, $(/replace @#twinmoon ! %1)

> or...
> /def -ah -mglob -t"{*@#twinmoon} is now relaying messages from this chat
> room." welcome_relay = /test echo "say Welcome to Twinmoon Odysseys,
> replace("@#twinmoon", "", %1)!" w

Arguments to /test are evaluated as an expression, so if you want to call
echo within it, you'd use  /test echo("...")
But that's not what you want anyway, because echo() (and /echo) only send
the text to your TF, not to the mud.

If you want to do some string hacking inside the echo argument, you could
do it this way:
/test echo(strcat("Welcome to twinmoon Odysseys, ", \
                  replace("@#twinmoon", "", {1})))

> and a few others (I'll stop spamming the list with all of my

I hope the above explanations help.  TF has a few different ways of
manipulating data and calling macros, but it all makes sense eventually. :)

You may want to read /help expressions and /help evaluation.

Try this:

>Kat@#twinmoon is now relaying messages from this chat room.

/def -mregexp -t'(.*)@.* is now relaying messages from this chat room.' \
	welcome_relay = say Welcome to Twinmoon Odysseys, %1!

I rarely use glob, but have you tried something like:

{*}@#twinmoon

as the trigger? This is, of course, assuming that {} is the 
backreference operator. Of course, if you were using regexp, I'd say use

([^@]*)@#twinmoon

and if you wanted to generalize it to accept anything looking like

<name>@#<place>

then I'd say use

([^@]*)@#([^\s]*)

with %1 being the name and %2 being the place. If you used this, you'd 
have to declare -mregexp as the flag instead of -mglob, though.

Wow, thank you all for your help!!  I haven't had a chance to try it yet
(still getting through the morning's email, about 50 minutes in so
far...), but I feel I've learned quite a bit more about how TF thinks! 
Thank again!!

Seems when I enter /repeat -1 1 /echo test
It takes 16 seconds for it to go off.
This should only take one second.

The last two copies I found
tf-40s1w.exe
tf-40s1-win32.exe

Dont support blinking ansi anymore.
The mud I play on uses this so its important.

What I dont understand is why command prompt in 98/NT/2000/XP
for win32 apps never addressed this problem.

The the old TF made in 1998 is the last one that has blinking supported.

I have a dos application that simply just calls the pascal function call 
clrscr which uses the CRT unit.
The TF will have blinking supported.

This is the only reason i'm using a copy so old.

The one i'm using is:
tf-40g1.exe

I'm hoping TF 5.0 is graphical based with built in blinking, then we 
don't need to worry about this anymore.

The windows verion of TF from 1998. According to the cygwin18.dll
This supports scroll region yet when I tested it with a simple
esc code [10;10r
Then the middle part of the screen should of started scrolling.
If I could do this then I could emulate split screen support, cause it's 
not all that hard.
I could also emulate it using virtual arrays and stuff but that would be 
huge overhead.

Works fine for me.

I'm running Mac OS 10.2.2, using the latest (official) tf from the 
terminal.

Hi all,

A query - I don't know if any of you have encountered the more
commercial MUD out there that have introduced their own ansi systems -
automatically colouring locations, exits, Gods, etc, but herein is where
my problem lies.

When using /highlite, /partial or indeed any form of color attribute
other than for /echo, I can only get bold or underlining effects to
work..

Turn the internal ansi system off, and it all works fine, but then I
lose all the features of distuingishing players and the like.

Any ideas??

Using TF 4.0 stable 1, compiled from source under Linux...

I have been using:

/def -Fp0 -PBCred -t'balance' (to try and just hilite the word 'balance'
in bright red.)

Works fine with ansi off. With ansi on, it is just displayed as normal -
doing a simple '/partial balance' it displays it in the bold standard
colour (as hiliteattr is just set to B - setting hiliteattr to Cred has
no effect either.)

Thanks in advance,

Richard.

I've run into this problem, too.  I have

/def -p11 -F -mregexp -PBCgreen -t'mushroom' mushroomlite

among my lites, which should put the word "mushroom" in bold green.
The MUD on which I play uses yellow coloring for room descriptions,
and if the word "mushroom" appears in a room description, it appears
in bold yellow.

Hi!

   I'm having some trouble evaluating a string that I've matched to 
see if there is a specific string in it.

String possibilities:

A blue elk            30 out
A star of quartz      13 out

I'm able to match the text ok and echo parts if I wish, but I can't 
seem to figure out how to

/def -mregexp -F -t'^A(.*) +([0-9]*) out.$' \
         count = /echo  There are  %P2 out. %;\
         /if ({1}  =/ 'elk') \
                 /echo "BING BING FOUND ELK!" %; \
         /endif


Thanks!
David

Well, according to your example, {1} should be something like 'blue elk 
      '

You may end up having to see if 'elk' is a substring of your string. 
Even if you trim it of whitespace, it will say 'blue elk' instead of 
'elk'.

Try '/if ({1} =/ '*elk*') \' with the glob matching type.
...or maybe that is '*elk' =/ {1} I can never remember.

Many thanks to Adrian Holzwarth for his fix -

Add the 'x' attribute to make TF e'x'clusively override the mud's
colourisation rules.

So, in your example: 

/def -p11 -F -mregexp -PxBCgreen -t'mushroom' mushroomlite

Should be fine!

Regards,

Richard.

See /help input

The library kbstack.tf makes use of the code to manipulate the input area,
so you may want to look at it as well.

Hi all :)

    I play a mud that has a nice map feature, when turned on it send a
string of characters that
can be converted into a map.  That's all well and fine..  I can catch that
string and /tr it into
an understandable map and echo it out, but..  I'd much rather display it in
a stationary position
on my screen.  It's a 5x5 map and having it scrolling with the rest of the
text from the mud is
a little much.  Is there a way to make the status line 5 lines long, or just
display it in the input
area in visual mode?  I've tried making it part of my prompt, but my prompt
refuses to span
multiple lines, wether I pad it or use line feeds (I use cygwin).  So I was
thinking maybe
echoing to the input area in visual mode just before my prompt, but I can't
find any info on
echoing to the input area.  <shrugs> Any ideas?


Thanks,
               Julius

{1} is 'A' for all of these, still first word on line even with
-mregexp.  Use {P1} instead.  And then you need {P1} =/ '*elk*' or
{P1} =/ '*{elk}*' more likely.

Hi.

The modified TF at tf-macros.sf.net now uses PCRE for all
regexp-matching.

Just noticed that i shoulda said
/def -F -i -mregexp -t'[kK]ill [ A-Za-z0-9]+ \* %P1 \(%P2\)'
The_Market_Road_cp_gq=\
   /if %P2=\
     (A suspicious looking australian|\
      ...
   /if %P3=\
     (A Butcher\'s Shop|\
      ...

I fixed that part but it still dont work :-(
I also tried:
/set mob=%p2%;\
/set room=%P3%;\
   /if mob=\
     (A suspicious looking australian|\
      ...
   /if room=\
     (A Butcher\'s Shop|\
      ...

And it didnt work.

Not sure how to do this:
Say i get this from the mud:
Kill at least 1 * A suspicious looking Australian (A Room in the Pub)
It passes thru this macro:

/def -F -i -mregexp -t'[kK]ill [ A-Za-z0-9]+ \* [ A-Za-z0-9]+ \(\
  (A Butcher\'s Shop|\
   A quiet hotel room|\
   A Room in the Pub|\
   A Small Chapel|\
   Wedding Reception Hall)\
  \)' The_Market_Road_cp_gq=/echo -aBCyellow (The Market Road)

And echos to me:
(The Market Road)


PERFECT! :-)
Now, what if there are more than one A Room in the Pub but only one A suspicious
looking Australian.

My code as it is will list ALL of the areas with a room called A Room in the
Pub.
What I want to do is have it echo if i am looking to kill A suspicious looking
Australian IN A Room in the Pub.
Basically, i think that if i use nested /if's it will do what i want.  I tried
it and failed tho. Never been able to get the handle on /if. /elseif and /endif
for some reason.

Kill at least 1 * A suspicious looking Australian (A Room in the Pub)

/def -F -i -mregexp -t'[kK]ill [ A-Za-z0-9]+ \* %P1 \(%P2\)'
The_Market_Road_cp_gq=\
  /if %P1=\
    (A suspicious looking australian|\
     A sarcastic killjoy|\
     a huge fluffy cat|\
     Kitten)%;\
  /if %P2=\
    (A Butcher\'s Shop|\
     A quiet hotel room|\
     A Room in the Pub|\
     A Small Chapel|\
     Wedding Reception Hall)%;\
       /echo -aBCyellow (The Market Road)%;\
  /endif%;\
  /endif

Test it with:
/trigger Kill at least 1 * A suspicious looking Australian (A Room in the Pub)

nothing happens :-(
Am i messing up something small, something big, something obvious?

Also, for multiple matching in other areas and room names and mob names after
the last /endif, is that where i would start with the /if's all over again?

  /if %P1=\
...
  /if %P2=\
...
       /echo -aBCyellow (The Market Road)%;\
  /endif%;\
  /endif
 /elseif
  /if %P1=\
...
  /if %P2=\
...
       /echo -aBCyellow (The Market Road)%;\
  /endif%;\
  /endif
etc

Thanks, but I don't want to send the map back to the mud, I'd just like it
displayed in the input area.  I would set the input area to be 6 lines,
hopefully be able to display 5 lines of the map and still have a line at the
bottom for my prompt..  This way the map wouldn't be displayed and scrolled
up as spam with the rest of the mud output..   :/

I think tf5 uses PCRE as well.

Not that it helps us any, because it's still unreleased!!!

Hi.

After we included Scott Crosbys 256 Color patch
(http://onca.catsden.net/~chris/tf-patches/) into our modified TF
(tf-macros.sf.net), I've found a bug:

in src/tf.h

#define F_NONE        0x2000000

There is a 0 missing, which makes NONE the same attribute as HILITE. The
correct define is:

#define F_NONE        0x20000000

If you use the s256Color-Patch you might want to fix it.
This bug is already fixed in the CVS.

Jens

Hi.

I've made some packages of the modified TF. You will find a source-TAR,
a SRPM and a RPM package of the modified TF at
http://tf-macros.sourceforge.net/packages/

Hi all,

Is there some sort of archive somewhere that has past discussions.  I 
was sure i was looking around the web one day and say a whole list of 
previous msgs from this list.  But of course i can't find it now.

Is there anything like this?

Many thanks

Peter.

I have suggested several times, and others have too, that it should not
be possible to send a message to the list unless you subscribe to it.
Unfortunately, that simple step of moderation does not seem to happen. I
still feel, strongly, that it should, and thus, in the best of Internet
tradition, I suggest that we, who think it is a sensible thing to do, do
it ourselves.

Does this sound like a good idea? 

Of course, there is the problem with people who find the
tinyfugue@tcp.com who do not find the new one, but we could of course
inform the original list of the existance of the new one. After all, if
spam posts are considered ok (and they obviously are), a bit of serious
info must be welcome.

I agree, either the list should be closed to non-subscribers (in terms 
of posting, not subscribing) or we need a new list.

I'd be willing to host a list at the address 
tinyfugue@lists.tildesoft.com if we need it.

X-List-Software: mlist v2.6 by James Lick with Majordomo

After a longer-than-expected period of not much progress, I have in the
past few months been working harder again on tf 5.0.  I recently fixed
a bug that I had considered a major obstacle to release.  There are
still loose ends to tie up, but I expect to be able to release 5.0
before very long, possibly by the end of December.  There are many many
more things on my todo list, but they can wait for a later version.

The biggest new features are:
* per-world virtual screen with scrollback
  Each world has its own virtual screen, with redraw, pageup, pagedown,
  etc.  To get functionality like this before, you would have to have
  done something like run the "screen" program, with multiple virtual
  windows, with each window containing a tf process connected to a
  single world.
* PCRE (perl compatible regular expressions)
  Much more powerful than the regexps in tf 4.0.
* compiled macros
  Macros (and any regexps they contain) are stored internally in a compiled
  form, for much faster execution.
* All time values have microsecond precision.
* Display attributes (color) are preserved across all string operations.


Here's the full 5.0 section in the CHANGES file.

DOCUMENTED
/dokey pause (^S)
added "/clock <format>"
strrchr() has optional offset argument.
added /features
world_info([<world>,] "cipher")
/edit does not renumber macro.
send() "h" flag and /send -h flag DO invoke send hooks.
/trigger -l is like /trigger -n, but gives full macro listing.
/edit does not renumber the macro being edited.

added /status_add, /status_rm, /status_edit, /clock {on|off}, %clock_format,
    %status_field_defaults.  You should no longer set %status_fields directly.
regmatch() returns any positive integer for success, not necessarily 1
    (so you should write (regmatch(...)), not (regmatch(...) == 1)
Renamed log() to ln() to avoid confusion with /log.
Lines beginning with '#' in /load'ed files are comments (and ';' still works).
Supports IPv6 (RFC 2553 and 2133).
Supports Mud Client Compression Protocol (MCCP) v2.
Added /paste options -x (execute) and -n (no prefix).
%meta_esc=on always converts a typed meta bit to ESC; %meta_esc=nonprint
  converts only if character is not printable.  The LNEXT key (^V) overrides
  %meta_esc.
Tabs are no longer confused by ANSI display codes from server.
Added -P option to /quote and /repeat to run on prompts, like %lpquote.
Prompted (-P or %lpquote) processes with a -w option are only run by prompts
  from the specified world.
Added /runtime.
If an additive operation on integers would overflow, it is converted to real.
TF will not terminate on SIGHUP if SIGHUP was ignored when TF was started.
/ps lists processes in ascending order of pid.
/paste accepts "." to end.
Added -A, -B, -C options to /recall to print lines of context around each
  matching line.
"/restrict file" disables /lcd.
Added %keepalive to detect dead connections even while idle.
Added %keypad to control application keypad mode.
getopts() options can take time arguments.
Optional offset argument to strchr(), strstr().
Optional length argument to tolower(), toupper().
Simplified proxy customization (but an old proxy_command that worked in 4.0
  will still work).
Clock defaults to 24 hour format (see /help clock).
Added %sigfigs.
Improved telnet protocol handling, and detection of telnet vs. non-telnet
  servers.  Apparent telnet commands commands are not stripped from data
  stream if server doesn't use telnet protocol.  /localecho may be delayed.
Changed default keybindings to be more consistent with those in emacs, bash,
  and other gnu readline applications.  The old bindings can be restored with
  "/load kb-old.tf".  See "/help keys".
  The most important changed keys are:
      Old          New                       Meaning
      left right   ^B ^F left right          move cursor back/forward
      ^B ^F        ^[b ^[f                   move cursor one word back/forward
      ^[b ^[f      ^[{ ^[} ^[left ^[right    change foreground socket
Added /purgealias to alias.tf.
Added /randline to textutil.tf.
Added is_connected().
bg_output is tested when socket is foregrounded (like /fg -q), instead of
  when text is received.
New screen handling:
  /dokey redraw (^L) actually redraws screen.
  Added /dokey clear (^[^L) to clear screen.
  %shpause defaults to on.
  Eliminated all "Resuming TinyFugue" messages and RESUME hook.
  Default status_int_world prepends "!" if foreground socket is a zombie.
  Changing a status_{int,var}_* will cause the status line to update.
Time is measured and printed with microsecond resolution:
  %prompt_sec and %prompt_usec replaced with %prompt_wait
  /recall:  h:m[:s[.f]] is interpeted as time-of-day, s.f as absolute time.
  ftime():  "%@" includes microseconds; added "%.", "%s", "%F", "%T" formats.
  /ps, time(), idle(), sidle() print or return values to the microsecond.
  Time values for /repeat, /quote, /at, %ptime, %maildelay can be specified
    to the microsecond.
Arguments to ftime() are optional.
ftime() supports %E and %O if system library does.
Added mktime().
Added "i" argument to /repeat for infinite count.
Variables used in status_fields do not need to exist.
Optional <pid> argument to /ps.
Expression variables are stored internally as natural types instead of
  strings for greater efficiency and to avoid loss of floating point
  precision.
Display attributes in string values are preserved by just about every string
  operation:  commands, variables, expression operators, functions, regexp
  substitutions, $() command substitution, and status bar field expressions.
Improved workaround for solaris terminal driver bug that could disable
  keyboard after typing LNEXT (^V), FLUSH (^O), STOP (^S), or START (^Q);
  also, in the extremely unlikely case that it does happen, it can be fixed
  with any signal (e.g., ^Z or ^C) without quitting tf.
Fixed handling of bold-off display attribute code from server.
An error within a tfrc file does not cause tf to try to load an alternate
  file.
When server requests window size (TELNET NAWS), tf sends %wrapsize instead of
  the actual screen width.
Fixed: "/addworld" with no args clears the name of the first defined world.
Fixed: "/unset MAIL" crashed tf.
Added "substr" matching type.
Added %tfhost and "/addworld -s<srchost>" to define client address of
  connections.
TF closes all open sockets, pipes, and files before the 'Press any key'
  prompt when dumping core, so servers and other processes don't have to wait
  for the keypress.
"/trigger -n ..." lists -F/-p/name of matching macros without running them.
    (Warning:  if high pri trigger would do a /substitute, /trigger -n results
    for lower priority triggers will be wrong.)
world names may not contain space.
new /listsocket flags:  p=proxy, o=open-connectionless, c=connected,
    x=connected-ssl


UNDOCUMENTED
/relimit repeats last limit
^[L (meta-shift-l) toggles last limit off and on.
Note: some emulators (NiftyTelnet, TeraTerm) incorrectly send ^[[3~ for
    PgUp; the correct meaning of ^[[3~ is Delete (in vt220 emulation).
    The PgUp key in these emulators will not work correctly in tf unless you
    (preferred) fix your emulator, or (easier) "/bind ^[[3~ = /dokey_pgup"
    (warning: may break your Delete key)
wrapspace=4 by default.
/listsockets shows number of old and new lines on each socket (total, not just
    limited).
moresize() takes flags to request only limited, only new, or only new limited
    lines.
Various keys are bound to /dokey_pg{up,dn} which in turn calls
    /dokey_hpage{back,}.  To make keys move a whole screenful, user should
    not rebind the keys, but redefine /dokey_pg{up,dn} to call
    /dokey_page{back,}.
Some messages (activity/background/mail hooks, /limit error) appear as
    temporary "alerts" on the status bar.  %alert_time controls duration of
    alert.  %alert_attr controls attrs of alert.  echo() to the "a" stream, or
    /echo -A, displays arbitrary text as alert.
@more status field counts physical lines (not logical lines); it shows both
    old lines and new lines; when a /limit is in effect, only limited lines
    are counted.
/limit [-a] [-v] [-m<style>] <pattern>:  redraws window, showing only lines
    that match <pattern> and/or have attributes (-a).  With no args, returns
    1 if limit is in effect, 0 if not.  Screen-specific.  Default @more status
    counts only limited lines.
bg_output and /fg -q mean jump-to-end when foregrounding
%max_kbnum.  warning: large kbnum may cause tf to exhaust all memory or do
    other bad things.
Fixed expansion of line pushed by kbpush (50a9).
If a multiply operation on integers would overflow, it is converted to real.
Prints overflow error when converting too-large real to integer or time.
status field attributes are modified by variable "status_attr_{int,var}_<name>"
Fixed 'illegal macro name ""' in '/edit #<N>'.
Fixed: glob comparison of end of string against pattern "*{..." could give
    incorrect results. (35a16)

is_open([world])
fake_recv(string[, world])
"windowed" (unconnected-but-open) worlds.
ESC-digit; global and local %kbnum; /dokey {recall,search}{b,f}, and
    recall{beg,end}, and macros in kbfunc.tf and kbstack.tf honor kbnum.
    Use ^G to abort kbnum.
/fg -cN
nextopt numeric args can be signed
Scrollback!
    /dokey hpageback (PgUp, ^X[), /dokey hpage (^X]),
    /dokey pageback (^X{), /dokey page (^X}),
    /dokey lineback (^[^P)
    /dokey line (^[^N)
    /dokey_flush means jump to end
    /dokey_selflush acts like limit
winlines()
Disables tty STOP/START to avoid problems and make ^S/^Q available to tf.
ssl:  /addworld -x, addworld(...use_proxy), /connect -x, /listsockets
/paste -t -q [cookies]
/paste eats trailing space; /paste -s doesn't.
vercmp() (in stdlib.tf)
/pfxgen and pfcmd() (in pcmd.tf)
Changed how attributes combine:  colors always override, not OR; inline x
  causes replacing of line attrs.
Synchronous processes can be interrupted.
Replaced Henry Spencer's regexp pacage with PCRE (Perl Comaptible Regular
  Expressions).  It is backwards compatible, with one exception:  the
  character '{' introduces a quantifier, so you must use '\{' to match a
  literal '{'.  Also, regexps containing no uppercase letters default to
  caseless matching.  All regexps (including static strings in macros and
  expressions, and regexps stored in variables) are now stored internally
  in compiled form, making them much faster.
Macros and expressions are stored internally in compiled form, making
  them faster.
macro usage counts with /list -su.
Added inline_attr().
Network/host unreachable does not cause disconnect, only loss of sent text.
New screen handling:
  Per-world screen buffers, including More prompt.
  %virtscreen (do not change while at a More prompt).
  Redraw after /suspend, /sh, and changing window size, %visual, or %isize.
  Doesn't automatically leave a dead socket if the text hadn't been seen.
  WORLD hook is silent (if virtscreen).
  A disconnected socket does not disappear automatically after displaying its
    buffered text.  It will dissappear if you /dc it again, or /fg another.
Fixed: if a loaded file did not end with newline, the last line was executed
  twice.

Definitely useful, and I have wanted to do this for some time.  The
reason I haven't is that there are serious reentrance problems as long
as keyboard reading is implemented with the main_loop() hack.  Some
likely situations to manifest the problems are doing a keyboard read from
a trigger when multiple triggers matched the same line, or changing
tf's state (current world, special variables, etc.) while in the middle
of typing the line at the keyboard.

Version 5.0 has compiled macros, which was a major step toward making
macros threadable.  This in turn will allow a future version to do
keyboard reads that work correctly (as well as other desirable features,
like sleep()).

This is a good idea, except it only works for variable status fields,
not internal status fields.  I have implemented this in 5.0 with
status_attr_var_<NAME> and status_attr_int_<NAME> (integrated into the
new status display code that automatically redraws status fields when
any of the status_{,attr_}{int,var}_<NAME> variables are modified).

What would you use this for?

This seems awkward to use across midnight boundaries (and I know quite
a few mudders who are active at midnight and/or have tf automation that
runs constantly).  In any case, it is unnecessary in 5.0, as all time
has microsecond precision.  There is also a new /runtime command to
evaluate the speed of command execution.

Unnecessary in 5.0, as all regexps are compiled and stored internally.

I don't understand this one.  There was never a standard /strstr macro,
and the standard tf strstr() function has always been implemented directly
with the C strstr() function.

I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to get notification within a 
desktop environment (eg Gnome) that the terminal within which tf is 
running has activity.

eg: Say I run gnome-term, and then in there I run tf, say I minimise 
gnome-term, is there any way possible to get it to flash when there is 
activity in tf.

Or indeed is there some state which is advertised by tf which I could 
monitor with an external program.. so I could write some sort of 
activity notifier myself (if there is no such thing available).

thanks

Yes, but nobody asked for dynamic colors in internal status fields, so
wie didn't implement it :-)

Hashing function.
We needed complex data structures like arrays and mappings (hashes) in
tf. md5() is used as an universal hashing function for hashlists.

It is also used as a checksum function that I use for some cryptographic
struff in tf (secure communication with other players that can't be
snooped by imps).

It would be nice, to have this function in TF5. If not, then I will add
this function to TF5 ;-)

Well you just have to check for negative differences and add 86400000 in
this case. I'm one of the mudders, that are active at midnight ;-)

Great :-)
Of course, this is the better way to handle regexps, but I don't have
the time nor the understanding of the TF sourcecode to do such major
changes. Implementing a function like regcomp was much easier and it
works :-)

You are right, I mixed it up. What I wanted to say is that replace() is
now an internal TF function.

Btw: the latest change is that you can close tferr temporarily (for the
current macro) like tfout.
It may be a bad idea to do so, but I am the user and TF has to follow my
orders ;-)
TF shouldn't forbid such things.

Jens, waiting for TF5 :-)

I agree, and I've asked the tcp.com guy to do this several times.  He
doesn't like the list software he's using, and is now considering
installing mailman.  Let's wait and see how that turns out before
moving the list.  If it doesn't work out, I'll consider cooperating
with migrating the existing list to a new home (I have access to the
subscriber list).

My list server is running mailman right now, and it is quite nice.

On a side note, now that I know that you're still alive and reading 
this, when can we expect to see a release of version 5?

I imagine when TF 5.0 comes out someone will compile it for the latest 
cygwin ?
My main beef with cygwin which is quite old now is it doesn't support 
blinking, the mud I am on using blinking
and without blinking I my character would have died.  Put simply I have 
to have blinking ansi.

So does the latest cygwin support this on windows NT/2000/XP/98 ?

Or does TF run in a graphical window with it's own terminal emulation 
like zmud ?

Activity in the current world cann be catched with a trigger, activity
in background worlds can be catched with the background hook.
A way to transfer the activity to the outside is /xtitle.

/def xtitle = /echo -r \033]2;%*\07

/xtitle text sets the window name of the TF window in xterm. It might
work in gnome-term/kde-term as well.

/def blink = /toggle blinkstate%;/if (blinkstate) /xtitle
ACTIVITY%;/else /xtitle !!!!!!!!%;/endif

/def scream = /repeat -1 10 /blink

Calling /scream shound be a silent way to notify activity. Of course you
can still use /beep if it is too silent ;-)

Yay yay yay yay yay yay ! :)

Now all I need is to find a terminal in X that'll do the 256 ANSI colours.

Then recode the MUD to support them.

Didn't see anything about arrays, is this getting added?

Also what about structured variables?
Binary files?

Will this stuff get added in future versions?

Hello!

I was working on an alias to save the whole world history into a file
that you specify with the alias, but I couldn't get it to work. Does
anyone know how to do this?

For example, if you type "savelog scrollback.txt" the alias savelog
would save the whole world history into the file scrollback.txt.

Thanks

You might be interested in etheridge.ca/source/histories.tf -- it saves
histories into files which can be reloaded into other TF sessions.

Gah!

Ok, this is annoying. The most annoying thing about the old list was 
that hitting the Reply button always addressed the reply to the person 
who sent the message, rather than the mailing list. This happened 
because the mailing list never attached a Reply-To: header, so Mail.app 
gets the address from the From: header.

Now with this new list, the same thing is happening! I know you can 
have a Reply-To: because my list server is mailman and my lists work 
fine. Can you /please/ add a Reply-To: header for the list?

Well, my only option is Reply To All Recipients, but there's 2 things 
wrong:

1) I have the key combo overridden by another app to launch REALbasic 
for me (Cmd-Shift-R). I don't want to change that

2) I would rather /not/ make every single one of my replies go to the 
list /and/ to the sender of the message I'm replying to. For instance, 
that menuitem would address this message to David Moore and have the CC 
be tinyfugue@tcp.com. I don't want that. I'd much rather hit Reply and 
have the To: field be the list address.

Why would you want the Reply button to address it to the sender of the 
message you're replying to? 98% of replies to list messages are 
intended to go to the list, not to the individual person. So it makes 
sense for Reply-To: to be the list address.

I think the answer here is "tough luck buddy; fix your key mappings" :)

PS. In mutt I just hit 'L' to reply to the list.

I hope this does not happen.  Mailing lists should not add or change the
Reply-To header. See a full explanation here:

I don't agree.

First, the 2 messages I examined had no Reply-To: at all.

Second, most people don't want to send list messages to individual 
people.

Third, as I stated, I DON'T want to reply all my messages to the list 
AND the person I replying to. It just really annoys me when I get the 
same message in my mailing list AND in my InBox.

My other lists set their Reply-To:, and it just makes life SO much 
easier. If I ever need to reply individually, I can just type their 
name in to the To: field. But as it is, on this list every time I need 
to reply to the list I have to type the list address in! You CAN'T say 
that's better.

Your argument might go better if you hadn't remapped your own keys :)

(Yes, I know this message may be screwed up, possibly in HTML... my 
mailer is somewhat broken right now, because I'm using a Mozilla nightly.)

The 'danger' and 'harm' implied by this web page are neither--for the 
author, they appear to actually be an inconvenience and, somehow, a 
personal insult.

How many messages on this list actually require personal replies as 
opposed to list replies?

If it's considered okay to have to manually edit the 'to' to make a 
list-only reply--which the 'reply all' requires for me, and probably for 
a lot of other people--then why is it not okay for someone to have to do 
a manual edit to send to the original author?  If both are okay, then it 
is reasonable to say that the setting should depend on which option is 
going to be used more often.  And on a list like this, most replies are 
going to be sent to the list.

Imho, it's all up to the client, and mail processing software to fix that.

I use wide-replies as you can see. And my client will sort out duplicates and
remove them. Just as the RFC's say. :)

I think the answer in this case would be "tough luck buddy; you should
fix your key remappings" :)

Time to start the next off-topic flamewar!  As choice of setting
reply-to to the list addresses for large public mailing lists is
a religious argument, I'd just generally suggest that the most
general life solution to this problem is learning the 'R' or 'g'
key or whatever makes your mail reader send group replies.

Likewise.

Anyone using procmail could borrow this snippet from my procmailrc. It
inserts a Reply-To: header.

:0
* ^List-Id: <tinyfugue.tcp.com>$
{
  # add a reply-to header
  :0 fBw
  | formail -i "Reply-To: tinyfugue@tcp.com"

  # put it into the tinyfugue mailbox - edit or comment out the next two lines

Did you read the page? Requesting a feature from the list 
manager for the mail clients which cannot handle lists 
properly, requesting at the same moment that the developers 
of the mail clients who CAN handle lists will take care via
questioning about using the Reply-To: instead of the From:... 
and then: "Any mailer, whose development team refuses this 
simple request due to some ideological position, cannot be 
said to be reasonable." 

*grunt* Are we going to be even more childish than before 
(consider that we all are used to play in Muds/Mushes/..)? 
There are reasons for using 'Reply-To:' set to the list, 
there are reasons against it. As far as I remember from the 
flamewars on other lists, the latter (Reply-To: not set) was,
is, and most probably will be the proper way.

Besides, please peek into the mailinglist's full header:

Ain't this enuff?

PS: As Karen I use mutt - "L" replies to the known mailing list. And
    I did a *lot* of replying to the sender and NOT to the list, because
    the list's latency is reallyreally awful... and if the problem 
    looks like being "I have it just NOW and not in 8 hours" as well
    as being an easy one then I don't answer to the mailinglist. 
    Sometimes this is even just not avoidable, coming from a T-DSL 
    dynamic IP range I'm used to be locked out by the list's spam 
    protection. At the moment, I'm looking for some hacks to dodge...

PPS: 4th try by now... List config errors? :)

Not sure if you meant this list or not.  The old one was pretty slow
unless you happened to be one of the first few addresses on the list.
However I've tuned the new install of Mailman to deliver in parallel, so
most people should get posted mail within a couple of minutes.  If not,
the problem is probably on your end. :)

As to the reply-to issue, my personal opinion is that much of the
functionality of reply-to can be accomplished by group-reply functionality
of nearly ever mail program I've seen without the problems of accidently
posting private replies, vacation messages, broken autoresponders and the
like.  And as others have said, this is really a religious issue more than
one of which method is better than the other.  However as Ken is the owner
of the list, it's really his call after I gave him admin access earlier.

*chant* 
Of course, I meant the _old_ one. This time I've seen my response from 
the list indeed within minutes (and NOT after a couple of hours) and 
didn't dare to believe it. 

Uh, by the way.... How many people are subscribed to tinyfugue? 

Curious, as ever,
  Adrian

345 at the moment, however I expect that will drop over the next week as
the old list hadn't had bad addresses cleaned out in a while.  Mailman
does most of that automagically.

I don't suppose the [TinyFugue] is configurable on a per user basis like it
is in Majordomo 2 is it?  Or did someone else stick that on at their end and
the replies are just propagating it?

It's added by the list, and is not configurable per user.  "[TinyFugue]" is
a bit long though; I think I'll shorten it to "[TF]".

Ho hum, procmail magic time :)  TF has a mail folder of its own, so I can 
remove the tag.

Yes, group reply does address to the list. But it ALSO addresses to the 
sender! I DO NOT want to send all my replies to the original sender as 
well, and I DO NOT like typing in the mailing list address for each 
reply! (nor do I like doing Group Reply then deleting the original 
sender's address).

PLEASE turn on Reply-To: list address! It just makes life much easier.

Wow... it seems this conversation crops up in one form or another on 
just about every mailing list I've ever seen.

How about we just keep the previous behaviour... it's what everyone is 
used to.

If you don't like incoming doubles, you can stop them.  Here's a
sample procmail recipe:

:0 Wh: $HOME/msgid
| formail -D 8192 $HOME/.msgid.cache

Don't insist that the list management crud things up for the rest of
us (including stomping legitimate Reply-To: headers) just because
you're too lazy or stupid to figure out how to use your mail client
properly.  Also, quit yelling.  That's rude.

How many times must I tell you, I'm not using procmail! I'm using Mac 
OS X and Mail.app, which does noth ave the feature to remove incoming 
duplicates!

You're assuming everybody's running procmail and has an 
ber-configurable client. I don't. I'm not lazy or stupid, there's just 
no means for me to do this.

And I was yelling because it's just very annoying to keep saying the 
same thing over and over.

You guys just don't seem to have consideration for those of us that 
can't filter incoming duplicates and suchlike.

All my other lists change the Reply-To: header to point to the list. 
Guess how many complaints there have been? ZERO. Everybody /likes/ how 
reply goes straight to the list. It's useful. There's no reason not to 
do it.

Obviously you haven't read the ample documentation as to why fooling
with the Reply-To: is a bad idea.

It all depends on the purpose of the list.

I also run a mailing list that USED TO HAVE the 'reply-to' header being 
set. I cannot count the times that what should have been a personal 
reply got directed to the list instead. In some cases, these personal 
replies were very embarrassing.

Personally, I'd much rather have replies sent personally by accident, 
than to the list by accident, even though it requires a little extra 
thought to hit 'reply to all' rather than 'reply' (Yes, I use Apple 
Mail, too), and the fact that the author will get a copy of the mail, 
too. (And, personally, I find that pretty cool).

All of this is documented in the 'Reply-to considered bad' document 
that was sent around before, if people would care to read it.

I looked at that page posted, and I just don't agree. Why is it a bad 
idea? 99% of the time, you want to reply to the list, not the sender. 
And if you want to reply to the sender, you can just copy the address 
or, if your client supports it, tell it to reply to the From: address 
rather than the Reply-To: address.

Perhaps I have to spell it out to you, since you seem to be too dense
to understand the argument:

1.  Having the Reply-To: set by the list removes a legitimate
Reply-To: set by the sender.  This is the most important problem,
since it means the list is causing important information to be lost.

2.  The behavior of the list to date is to not set the Reply-To:
header.  Changing the behavior might mean embarassing personal replies
get sent out to the list, due to an unexpected and unnecessary change
to the list.

There are two very good reasons not to set the Reply-To:, opposed to
your one reason proposed for your convenience.  I think the resolution
to this argument is clear: do not set Reply-To:.

There are valid reasons.  The "reply-to-harmful" URL mentioned earlier
lists many of them.

Sigh.  Guess I'll contribute to the din.

I'd vote to put the Reply-To: in, even though it's rather bad.

Ideally, it shouldn't be there.  It potentially masks existing
information, it has bad failure modes, and all the other things in
"Reply-To Considered Harmful".  The "proper" way to do replies, IMHO, is
to do them the way mutt does: have separate functions for reply-to-author,
reply-to-group (i.e. all recipients), and reply-to-list.  Unfortunately,
most clients don't have that last function.  (To my knowledge, mutt is the
only one that does.  Counterexamples?)

Group-reply isn't necessarily an alternative, either, since it does result
in duplicate messages being sent (sometimes in contravention of the
original message's Mail-Followup-To: header).  The usual procmail
duplicate filtering has its problems, too.[0]

Until the common MUAs all have good list-reply functionality, I really
can't bring myself to seriously advocate for the absence of the Reply-To:
header, if only because people complain all the louder when it's not
there.

I'll finish by pointing out that mutt has many features for dealing with
Reply-To-munging lists.  (Take a look at the "ignore_list_reply_to"
option.)  Most other clients don't have the appropriate functionality to
cope with the reverse situation.


[0] I sort my mail based on headers specific to the list, _not_ on To: or
    Cc:.  If someone CC:s both me and a list, I'll get one copy in my
    inbox and one in the list's mailbox.  The personal one often gets
    there first, though, so duplicate filtering would trash the list
    copy--the one that would show up in its thread and the proper context
    and all that.

Nice attitude.  Arrogant, superior, anti-social.  Enjoy your little 
superior attitude, it's not winning you any points here, and that's the 
nicest thing I have to say about it.  Oh yeah, and welcome to my kill

Obviously you are a biased an arrogant gentleman that lacks the 
civility to be civil and respectful.

After all of this bitching perhaps someone could simply provide the 
answer.

A) OS X uses a mail system that can be used with Procmail.  Install, 
configure and enjoy.

B) Use mail.app's rules to deal with the problem.

	- create a folder in your 'On My Mac' folder, named TinyFugue.
	- add a rule that matches on Any with 'To' 'Contains' 
'tinyfugue@tcp.com' and
		'Cc' 'Contains' 'kevin@sb.org'  with action Stop Processing rules
	- add a rule that matches on Any with 'Cc' 'Contains' 
'tinyfugue@tcp.com' and
		'To' 'Contains' 'kevin@sb.org'  with action Stop Processing rules
	- add a rule that matches on Any with 'To' 'Contains' 
'tinyfugue@tcp.com' and
		'To' 'Contains' 'kevin@sb.org'  with action Stop Processing rules
	- add a rule that matches on Any with 'Cc' 'Contains' 
'tinyfugue@tcp.com' and
		'Cc' 'Contains' 'kevin@sb.org'  with action Stop Processing rules
	- add a rule that matches on Any with 'To' 'Contains' 
'tinyfugue@tcp.com' and
		'Cc' 'Contains' 'tinyfugue@tcp.com'  with action Transfer To 
'TinyFugue'
	- write an email to the persistent and vocal gentlemen that was so busy
		looking down his nose at your choice of tools and tell him to go stuff
		his arrogant attitude where the sun doesn't shine.

P.S. Gary, I regularly use and manage Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X and

Amiga's, NeXT, AIX, MVS, HP/UX, Digital Unix and BeOS.  You're 
arrogance is equal to that of the most howling bigots I've met in any 
of those environments.  I would personally appreciate that you either 
moderate your opinions in the future, or reserve them to people who 
might actually enjoy listening to you.  I certainly don't.

Regarding the 'Reply-To header': Personally, I don't care if it's set or
not. I can live with both variants. I am just happy that the list is now
mailman-based, and only allows subscribers to post. Happy, happy, happy.

I reserve respect and civility for people who don't hop up and down,
yelling at the list, insisting that they get their way.  It's a shame
you've jammed your fingers in your ears, and won't see my reply.

>After all of this bitching perhaps someone could simply provide the

It would have been nice to have your contribution before things got
ugly.  Given your snide remark at the end of your instruction, it
seems you share my opinion about being civil and respectful.

My comment about certain individuals being too lazy or stupid
to fix the problem on their own end still stands, though: instead of
solving the problem themselves (and obviously, the problem can be
solved technically, given your solution), they are attempting to force
their ill-advised opinion on the rest of the list at large.

I think you're extrapolating a great deal of OS biggotry out of a
single off-hand comment about the suitability (or lack thereof) of a
particular MacOS X client.  And that, only after the individual in
question was whining about the lack of suitability (present or not) of
that client.  Personally, I think MacOS X is great.  I advocate it's
use at every appropriate opportunity.

I've stated the case against inserting a Reply-To: header.  I don't
intend to make any more posts on the subject.  However, I will defend
myself if anyone chooses to make further issue.

Not so much 'counter' but Horde's PHP based IMP webmail client does support it
(as used by Spamcop and researchable at http://horde.org/).  Unfortunately,
Mozilla does not... :-(

I should reply to the mail one back in the chain, but I deleted it in
my haste.

MH provides a great deal of flexibility in terms of what you can do,
including the nature of a reply (see repl(1) for those of you who have
it installed).  However, MH is not suited to casual users.

It's great if you get 1000+ pieces of mail/day.

I have considered both sides, and have decided not to add a Reply-to:
header to the list.  I do not want to see any more posts on the pros or
cons of Reply-to:, or flames of any sort.  The only related posts that
are acceptable are specific constructive instructions on how to deal
without Reply-to: headers (e.g., how to configure a mailer to reply to
the list, to avoid sending duplicates, or to filter out received
duplicates).  If there are any more flames, I'll start moderating
messages, and I'd rather not have to do that.

Gnus has everything one could ask and much more, just like emacs in general ;)
Including all the different reply-to options you mentioned.

I do this in Gnus too. fancy-splitmail-method stuff reads through my inspool
and puts everything in the proper places following the regular expressions I set
up for it.

Good and good, I know my MUA has all the functionality I need. But it's in
emacs so alot of people will not use it just because of that. And it has a
pretty steep learning curve, preferably including elisp coding.

If you are interested in Gnus have a look at,
http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?CategoryGnus for example. It's always
a good start.

Mac OSX is unix and as such does have the ability to do what you want.

Not quite true, it is not as easy as just using the mail.app, but it is 
possible.

Mac OSX has both 'fetchmail' and 'procmail' installed by default.

You set up fetchmail to collect the mail from your POP/IMAP servers and 
deliver it to the localhost. Then you use procmail to do it's magic and delete 
spam, sort into  folders, munge headers etc... etc...

Then you read mail from your localhost rather than the remote server(s).

Hope this helps.

Just an interlectual exercise...

As far as I can she.. It would be theoretically possible for a client to
configure wether they wanted the reply to adress specified as the list or
the sender.  Make it a user-config option, and everyone happy.  Perhaps we
should submit this as an idea to the author of the list software were using.

If you wanna flame me, do it privatly.

Which works fine, unless you're wanting to use IMAP rather than POP, in 
which case you need to do all the procmail befunkery on the mail 
server, which many users do not have access to.

Also, forcing OS/X users to play around with the Unix side, just 
because they have a Unix underpinning now, isn't a good idea. There are 
a lot of things that can screw up, and I'm sure you're not willing to 
be the 24/7 support person for when things go awry.

Yes, it would be nice if Apple Mail had support for list management in 
their application, but that kind of thing /IS/ an advanced mail 
feature, and Apple Mail, while exceptionally functional, isn't to the 
'advanced' stage, yet, and probably never will be.

The better solution all around is to 'train' folk to always check the 
receipient lines before hey hit 'Send'. After all, you really should 
know where you mail is being sent before you send it :) Thankfully, 
Apple Mail has an EXCELLENT autocomplete feature... I just type 'tiny' 
and up pops the tinyfugue address. It's neat!

So complain to your vendor, since by all accounts, its their software
which seems to be insufficient for coping with modern Internet email.
Demanding that everyone else go along with a proposal that reduces the
functionality available to us in order to accomodate your broken mailer
*is* rude.

In addition, you have just sent an email containing 8-bit characters to an
Internet mailing list, without correctly declaring a character set in your
headers.  If you are neither lazy nor stupid, you are nevertheless a
voluntary user of willfully broken software; on the Internet, this is just
as bad.

And it's pretty annoying to keep hearing the same thing over and over --
especially when it's wrong.

Well, I for one have no problem with you posting your whole file.. I 
(obviously) am new to the list and TinyFugue itself. I've been looking 
for some good programming examples for a few months now and I must say 
in my newbish opinion you did a great job in that file. Thank you for 
sharing good code.

(k.c.f.)

PS - if anyone here knows of other resources of good code examples.. 
i've exhaustively read the TinyFugue help and online resources at the 
home page.  looking for code examples archive or contributed source for 
furthering knowledge, hands on is the best way to learn.

I'm not certain you could call my code "good", but it does what I want it
to.  I have a selection of my stuff plus contributions from other players
of Aardwolf available at http://www.birdbrained.org/tf/

I hope you find it useful.

Is there any version of TF for windows where the /repeat works properly?  I
havn't seen any myself and I was wondering if anyone has.

Also, has anyone coded any muds to support the 256 color code?  I'd like to
see some examples of it.  I'm considering adding support for it to my mud.

Yes there is, I just rebuilt the binary today, I'll be assembling the
installer over the weekend if I can get the last two pieces of code
completed and working for it (the path translation, using the 'My Documents'
folder for the HOME directory).

On the 256 Color patches, they are not being applied to the TF-win code as
the Windows console doesn't support it.

One bit of warning, the new Windows code now supports an interface to a GUI
config and will eventually sport both a mapper and macro builder, through a
new library (winlib.tf).  The downside is that it will require the .NET
framework to be installed, the upside is that the C# code that's it's
written in will be available with the TF source.

As Gwen can tell you, I've been more or less ignoring the Windows code until
RedHat/Cygnus settled on a path structure.  Now that they've settled that,
I'm refreshing the code to support that and fix the missing features.
Quote, and Sys both work now, as does Repeat and a few other broken
features.  As far as I can tell, missing Blink and missing Bold ANSI
functions are the last remaining bugs, and those I don't expect to ever get
fixed.

I'm considering also writing the GUI bolt on to support Mac OS X as well
(Objective C).  If they workout, I might consider doing a version for Linux
/ Mono as well, probably using GTK#.

I'm also updating the all installers and source on a CD package as well if
anyone is interested.

Andy

I'm suprised they cant emulate blinking ansi.  I wrote a vt52 emulator 
12 years ago.  Its not even that hard.  So looks like TF 5.0 is going
to be the only mudclient out there that cant do something as simple as 
blinking ansi.  Which is too bad i'll have to pass it up.

By the way how I did blinking ansi.  Was I made a double demension array
of 25 rows, 80 columns.  When a character at a particule row was to get
blinked, it would be something like this blink[10,15] := true.
Each time the screen scrolled the array would get scrolled as well.
Then I set windows timer to call my blink function X amount of seconds.
Make a loop like this:
for row := 1 to 25 do
   for col := 1 to 80 do
     begin
       if (blink[row, col]) then
         {erase character row}
     end;

Then make the code toggable so that when it gets called
say every 2 seconds, so at 2 seconds it will black out all
the blinked spots, then 2 seconds later restore them
And presto you have blink.  With machines as fast as they are
today this would be no problem to do in a console window.
And I did this on a machine running at like 40mhz in graphics
which is even slower than a console window of today.

So why cygwin can't emulate blink is beyond me.

Me too, it's not hard to do, but they haven't, and I have too much real work
that pays the bills to deal with to have the time to hack blink into their
TERMCAP. 

That said, I'm not 100% certain that it is completely Cygwin's fault, I've
noticed that if you run 'edit' prior to running tf in a command prompt, it
works, so it may be something in the Windows Console that is the problem.

For the majority of things, cygwin command line tools simply run in a normal
windows terminal. The cygwin setup program shows rxvt as being available,
Personally, I prefer this since it just works faster.

I have no doubt a variety of other terminal emulators can be accessed by the
magic of the cygwin XFree86 server, which now supports rootless mode.

This is correct, and tf behaves just like the other tools, with a couple of
exceptions.  The big one in this case is that TF uses the CygWin Termcap
library, which more or less maps to the Windows Console API, but doesn't
appear to properly support the BLINK ANSI tag.  The same problem afflicts
the Windows 2000 and XP command line Telnet client as well.

Quoting Rob Andrews <rob@impure.org.uk>:

It doesn't support it very well IMHO.  Cygwin still mark rootless as
'experimental' I believe, and I consistently have xterms run away with 100% of
CPU and just sit there when trying to exit from a rootless X, whereas a normal
rooted X exits cleanly and politely every time...    weird!

Also, Andy mentioned that his new TF win32 builds used the My Documents
directory as home - will it still be possible to overide this for those of us
that have an actual home directory on our windows boxes under our Cygwin
installation?

Blink is over rated.  HEh.  Just kidding.
Seriously has anyone coded 256 ansi into their mud?
Is there any special terminals that would be needed to support that?

Absolutely, the way it works is that if it doesn't find a 'HOME' 
defined in the environment, it falls back to the Windows style home 
folder that is the My documents mess.

Hello.

I've searched the web for a while and tried to understand ftime() and how to 
use it for my purpose but I couldn't find any solution.

What I want to do is have tinyfugue start a log (or continue an existing one) 
on startup. The format of the log's filename should be ~/mud/<date>.log or 
something like that.

How would I do that?

Mark

Me too, it's not hard to do, but they haven't, and I have too much real work
that pays the bills to deal with to have the time to hack blink into their
TERMCAP.

That said, I'm not 100% certain that it is completely Cygwin's fault, I've
noticed that if you run 'edit' prior to running tf in a command prompt, it
works, so it may be something in the Windows Console that is the problem.

Andy

Yes thats true, but that trick only works on an old build of TF I got
from you years ago, the newer builds you made for win32 dont work
with this trick.  I made a dos program called blinkme that does the
same thing to the screen as the dos edit does.  The big anoying thing
with making blink work this way is:
1. Can only get blink to work in full screen mode.
2. Resizing the screen, going to window and back, will disable blink.
     I then have to disconnect from the mud, go back to console, run
     blinkme again, then reconnect.

How do you support 256 colors in console, when you go full screen far
as I know you're limited to the standard 16 colors that the video card
has set for text?

Maybe one day ken keys will put full ansi support into TF its self :)
One can only hope. zmud has already done it.

Funny that you mentioned that cause I done this already.  The old copy I 
have is a litle bugged with /at command but this works pretty well.
;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;code that logs mud sessions, a new log file will be started each day at 
midnight
;if you're currently mudding
;log_session will get called at midnight using the /at command
;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/def log_session = \
      /log -i ///F//Data/logs//$[ftime("%b-%d-%Y", time())].txt %;\
      /log -w ///F//Data/logs//$[ftime("%b-%d-%Y", time())].txt %;\
      /IF (at_logged_flag = 0) \
        /at 01:01 /log_session %;\
        /set at_logged_flag 1 %;\
      /ENDIF

The best I could get my copy of TF is to start a new log at 1am if 
you're on line.
A new file name is made for each day so you don't end up with 100+ meg file.
Easier to manage this way.

File names come out like this:
Dec-02-2002.txt

Just jumping into this thread without having payed it much attention
before.. so forgive me.

This is a nice idea..I currently simply log each world to a separate
file.. and the do indeed get big.

Is there away the code you suggest could be used to log each world to a
separate file, which is dated, etc?

eg: So they come out like:
WorldBlah-Dec-02-2002.txt

although probably would be preferable (for me) to have:

2002-12-02-WorldBlah.log but actual name format is I assume down to
personal preference :)

Here's what I use. Ignore the comment about the multi-machine status check. 
It has to do with other macros I use.
If you want, you can leave off the last macro (the one that aliases /dc to 
QUIT). If you don't, it may break any 'auto-reconnect' macros you might have.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;; Special Logging Macros
;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; Put together from definitions by Andrew Mortimer and members of the
; Tinyfugue mailing list

; When I connect to a world, it starts logging (-w) to the file
; 'date_worldname.log', where date is in the format Year-Month-Day. For
; example: 1997-12-02_<world>.log. It also writes the time the log starts 
in the file.
; This format keeps logs in date order in the directory.

;;; This version doesn't include the multi-machine 'status' check:

/def -Fp100 -h'connect' connect_log = \
   /log -w ${LOGDIR}/$[ftime("%Y-%m-%d", time())]_${world_name}.log %;\
   /eval /echo -ag -w${world_name} \
%============================================================================== 
%;\
   /eval /echo -ag -w${world_name} \
%=            Log for world *** ${world_name} ***, started $(/time %%c) %;\
   /eval /echo -ag -w${world_name} \
%============================================================================== 
%;\
/endif

;This is the disconnect function, noting the time the log ended and closing 
the file.

/def -Fp100 -h'disconnect' disconnect_log = \
   /eval /echo -ag -w${world_name} \
%==============================================================================

   /eval /echo -ag -w${world_name} \

The .NET framework? Does this refer to the Visual packages (VB/V 
C++/Foxpro) going over to .NET, or, is this something else?

Yes, I can. I'm relieved to see that it hasn't been completely abandoned, 
though. Good things come to those who wait!

Thanks for sticking with it!

Sorry, that was my bad from trying to cut and paste from a larger version 
of the macro.

/def -Fp100 -h'connect' connect_log = \
   /log -w ${LOGDIR}/$[ftime("%Y-%m-%d", time())]b_${world_name}.log %;\
   /eval /echo -ag -w${world_name} \
%============================================================================== 
%;\
   /eval /echo -ag -w${world_name} \
%=            Log for world *** ${world_name} ***, started $(/time %%c) %;\
   /eval /echo -ag -w${world_name} \
%==============================================================================

Here's the corrected paste. The rest I posted to the list should be correct 
as they're functional directly from my .tfrc.

I put the auto-logging script I use (edited properly this time ;)) online:

http://www.geocities.com/goldmooneachna/tinyfugue/logging.txt

Also, this is my general TF page, which includes links to several macro 
examples, and guides on writing macros:

http://www.geocities.com/goldmooneachna/tf.html

Hopefully these resources will be useful to people out there. I don't 
update them all that often, but, the information is fairly static <heh>. 
When new things come up, I do try to link/archive them.

I'm downloaded Cygwin last night and setup pretty standard build
environment, with No-X emacs, X11, gcc and etc...
I'm already irked to death as emacs wouldn't support C-x C-c to save unless
I set the Cygwin env to include TTY.. After over coming that I quickly
realized
C-space and C-@ didn't work to mark regions in emacs, and even terminals I
sshed into.. After encountering such problems already I'm skeptical to how
well TF would do in Cygwin.. Has everyone had the same problems as me, or is
this a symptom of running the latest cygwin?

PS, It's installed on a Win 2k box with the latest updates.

Ok, if you turn of the tty option in the cygwin environ var, and use
xterm/emacs, everything works fine, as near as I can tell.

Is there a TF cygwin version available?

I'm less than enthralled with Cygwin, but for the moment, it's the most  
workable solution for some specific items.  In the case of TF, it's  
fairly complete.

Once I get my hands on TF5, I'll reevaluate doing a full port to the  
Win32 console.  It is possible, it's just going to require some very  
ugly code to get around 2 or 3 issues on the current codebase.

I've already done parts of this code when I did the BeOS 4.5 port of TF  
4.0s1, so I know it's possible, I'm just hesitant to jump into it on  
the 4.0 codebase, knowing that the 5.0 codebase isn't too far off.

Thanks, that was exactly what I was looking for. How to use ftime() in the 
/log line :)

I have a nearly complete installation of Cygwin under NT, and so it is 
possible to compile the TF sources, even the patched TF from tf-
macros.sourceforge.net compiles pretty good. I get some error messages 
about failed installation at the end of the compilation process, but that 
doesn't prevent TF.EXE from being created. 

That TF.EXE doesn't need the Cygwin environment any longer to run. Just 
copy it from the sources folder to any directory of your choice and put 
the required cygwin DLLs there, too. Adjust the environment variables 
needed to run TF (TFLIBDIR, PATH, HOME etc.) and execute TF.EXE.
I must admit that my TF base directory consumes about 3.5 Megs of 
harddisk space, but that's nothing compared to the 300 Megs of that 
Cygwin stuff...

TF under 2k should run as smooth as it does under NT.

P.S.: You should take care of the files you store your macros in, these 
should in any case be in UNIX text format. My favorite editor for this 
purpose under Windows is Textpad.

More colours seems nifty, but is there a terminal emulator in some major
linux distribution that supports it 'out of the box'?

Yes, SuSE Linux 8.0 comes with a 256-color-xterm.

I've more or less finished the Windows modified installation of TF 
4.0s1, now I'm looking for a couple of people to run through and test 
it for me.

A couple of notes...

I have removed the dependancy upon the HOME and TFLIBDIR environments 
in Windows, if either one is defined, it will attempt to use that 
instead, but they will now fall back to the Windows behaviour of using 
using C:\documents and settings\username\my documents\ for HOME and 
currentworkingdirectory\tf-lib for the TFLIBDIR.


If you are willing to strip your existing TF configuration and try this 
one, please contact me so that I can get you the installer.  If I don't 
get any volunteers this evening, I may just put it on the website 
tomorrow.

Andy

Just curious, I use the Windows version of TF at home (XP) and at work (NT).
Would making it use the current setting in the autoexec.bat file:
set HOME=c:\jason\tinyfugue\home
set TFLIBDIR=//c/jason/tinyfugue/tf-lib
still be possible?

funny thing, i never even use Home.
Actually deleted it. :-)

Has anyone ever made a Kills per hour counter?
I know how to count the kills, but the prob is the time
It all has to do with time() or something, but I haven't been able to figure it
out.

I was thinking of something that on a mobs death would give me:
You have killed 10 mobs in the past 2 hrs.

I was also looking to figure out how to add experience gained into that as well:
You have killed 10 mobs for an avg of 130xps in the past 2 hrs.

The kills and the avg i think i can figure out, but knowing me, prolly not.


TIA

Big problem with that... a LARGE number of people still use Win98 (and
even 95) boxes for stability.  That above is 2000/XP only, which will of
course break.

One should never hardcode My Documents automatically...or any other
directory that can't be 100% guaranteed correct.

The HOME and TFLIBDIR should be set to directories which will always be
correct.  One way is to just have it set to something like
currentworkingdirectory/home just like you've done with the tf-lib
directory. 

Even better, one thing that has never changed and likely never will is the
Program Files directory, which is always referenceable as progra~1 for
programs that can't handle spaces.  So why not have everything in there
where programs belong anyway?  Like: 

c:\Program Files\TF40S1\

Seems quite logical...and guaranteed to work every time.  Create tf-lib
and home directories underneath as deemed appropriate, and you're set.

Of course, even better would be to include an installer that can do it
appropriately based on the OS in use and create the proper configurations
and assigns for the situation...but that's a bit more work. :)

Last time I checked this dir changed name depending on what language Window 
has... And no, I'm not talking about the language-settings, but i.e Windows 
2000, Swedish Edition, doesn't have 'Program Files', but rather 
'Program'... I'm sure there's other examples too... Also, you can't count 
on c: being the drive containing the Program Files directory.

So I'd say it'll break.

Andy might as well do as he planned and let people set HOME if needed.

My 2 cents.

I'm here to cooperate with you a hundred percent.
A hundred percent.
I'll be just right down the line with ya'.

There are, IIRC, specific variables that can be called to reference that.
I think "program files" is actually %programroot% or somesuch.

I have a copy of Installshield 5 here, I might be able to do an isntaller
if I can remember how.

It doesn't use that directly, it uses the API to get ther current  
users data folder, as per windows specifications, this could be on the 
C: D: or even a UNC path..

I know I've been promising an update for months :-).

Well it finally got finished. Thanks to a couple of testers, it looks 
like it's all wrapped up.  We've added some features and eliminated all 
but the last few Cygwin bugs (blink being most notable).

It's all now available at http://www.druware.com/tf

The new program seems fine the path change breaks a lot of code I have, 
but I can fix that.
But how do you turn off the block mouse in full screen mode this is very 
anoying.
By the way you can still get blink with this version if you run edit 
prior to running the application.

There must be some form of cygwin config file that controls things like 
mouse block cursor on/off.
Also other things like if you set the console for 81 columns then go 
full screen start typing beyond 80 it shifts the whole screen.
See what I did in older TF was set the console to 81 columns and set the 
wrapsize to 80, this way I could type a character right up
to the 80th column.  

For blink to work make sure you're in full screen first, run a dos 
application like edit, then launch TF.  Cant wait for the day when blink
works both in full screen and window mode :)

I found out that the new TF that uses a new cygwin no longer will allow 
^Q to work, so I changed it to ^K.
Everything else works fine, ^K is restored to what it should be after 
you exit scroll back.

I know I've been promising an update for months :-).

Well it finally got finished. Thanks to a couple of testers, it looks
like it's all wrapped up.  We've added some features and eliminated all
but the last few Cygwin bugs (blink being most notable).

It's all now available at http://www.druware.com/tf

Andy

Noticed another problem.  When TF is running in a window, you cant right 
click on the screen to cut and paste.  On top of having a strange mouse 
cursor in full screen mode as well.

I wanted to make sure it wasn't windows, so I ran telnet which in XP 
which runs just like linux telnet, and it didn't show any weird mouse 
cursor in full screen mode.

But I have to have cut and paste, or i'll have to drop back to the 
previous version.  I cut and paste a lot during mudding.

So I hope these can be fixed, cause I like the new version.

Can I bring http://gtinyfugue.sourceforge.net/ to the attention of any
tf users who happen to use (or have installed) gnome2.

The above linked project is in a very very early state, but may be
interesting for some.

Don't hesitate in contacting me off list if you want more info.

I probably ought to document this...

This is a change that needs to be made to the console window you are 
using :-)

If you click the top left icon (command) and select properties off that 
menu.  On the 'Options' tab, there is an option for Quick Edit and 
another for Insert Mode.  Make sure both of those are checked.

That will solve your Cut/Copy/Paste problems :-)

I'm looking into the others.

Andy

That will make it so you when you press right mouse a menu won't show.
I need it so I get that menu.  I don't know why this part of console 
gets disabled when ever sh.exe is running or when tf.exe is running, so 
it's not just with tinyfugue

I did some more experimenting, I reinstalled the older TF I have, and I 
found the console when in full screen does shift left if you have more 
columns than can actually be shown in full screen.  But once the older 
TF starts it doesn't do this.  The reason I do this is if I set the 
console to 80 columns and the wraps.  The way wrapsize works is it won't 
let you enter a full 80 columns of text if your console is at 80 columns 
and if you try to set it to 80 columns, weird stuff happens like if you 
enter 81 characters of text you cant move the left arrow back to the 
beggining of the line.

Hello,
    So. The latest PennMUSH has accent(), and i've been wanting this
forever, so i'm using it madly. In-game, there is support for
registering 'accent templates' for words so people don't have to
remember them, and calling of 'fidaccent(word)' to return the word
with the proper accent marks. That's all great and stuff, but I sort
of wanted to cheat.
    So I did this:
    /def -mregexp -T'tiny.cethia' -h"SEND Kaladanis" Kaladanis_word=\
	/send $(/replace Kaladanis [fidaccent\(Kaladanis\)] %*)

    This worked great. I had but to 'say I am Kaladanis!' and it would
properly accent Kaladanis. The problem I noticed next was-- what if
there is more then one word that i want to accent in one sentence? I
don't know what to do at this point to make that work. Stupidly I
tried to fall-thru the sends, but that results in, say, three lines
being sent to the client if I did--
    
    say I am Kaladanis of Ione Decadarim
    
    with Kaladanis, Ione, and Decadarim all having accent marks. I
am not positive what to try next. :) Any ideas? Is this possible at
all?

Thanks in advance!

Well, I can think of one solution.

First, make all your hooks higher priority than 1. Second, make them 
all fall-thru. Third, I don't remember if this is automatic or not, but 
make sure they prevent the text from sending.

Then, instead of using /send, simply use /set and set a well-named 
variable (like Accented_Line or something) to the text. Also, in each 
trigger, check if that variable exists. If it does, use it instead of 
%*.

Then make a send hook for all words (i.e. just -h"SEND") with lowest 
priority that looks for the existence of that variable, and if it is 
there than it /sends it.

Basically, that should store the modified line in a variable for all 
hooks that are run, then the last hook will send it. I hav no idea how 
well it will hold up under times when you're sending a lot of lines 
with accented words quickly, but if it does break you'd probably have 
to be /quoting something with no delay, or something like that.

If you want I can make a mock-up of this setup on my own system and see 
how it works.

Don't call /send from the send hook - just let the replaced text fall
through, and it will be picked up by the other send hooks.  The problem
with just doing that is that your replaced text will also match the
same send hook, so you will get an infinite loop.  So, the solution to
that is to use a more complicated pattern, to stop the looping:
e.g. -h'SEND (^|[^(])Kaladanis'

I set up this as a test:

/def -p1 -mregexp -h'SEND (^|[^(])Kaladanis' Kaladanis_word =\
  $(/replace Kaladanis [fidaccent\(Kaladanis\)] %*)
/def -p1 -mregexp -h'SEND (^|[^(])Iona' Iona_word =\
  $(/replace Iona [fidaccent\(Iona\)] %*)

Typing this text:
say my name is Kaladanis of Iona

results in this being sent to the mud:
Miyu says, "my name is [fidaccent(Kaladanis)] of [fidaccent(Iona)]"

The key is to not call /send explicitly, because text sent with /send
will be sent immediately and will bypass send hooks.

Ah! Brilliant. That worked perfectly, and is very easy. I set up a
small python script to generate a .tfrc-words file which will be
/loaded, so that I have to just provide it a list of words to do
this for.. and it works perfectly. heh. I'm very, very new to TF
programming.. i've never had a real need to do anything seriousely
server-side before.

One last question. I'd like a final feature of this whole thing to
be, basically:
    replace any occurance of `word` with [fidaccent(word)] that
    are sent to the server.

I tried a few different versions, but don't seem to be able to 
accomplish it at all. My general result is either non-functioning
or massive recursion. I should bribe someone into embedding 
Python into tf. ;)

I'd like (for my own twisted purposes) to be able to do:
/set isize=0
With the obvious consequence of having the input typing area not be
visible. Currently isize has to be 1 or more.

Is there a way I could get it to be 0?

I don't think so, and even isize=1 has some unusual side effects in 
both windows and macosx terminal.

Hm. I'm currently working on doing Kevin Ballard's solution, but its a
bit more complicated, so I tried yours as well-- but yours seems to do
exactly the same thing that mine did before.

The text is not falling through to the other "send" hooks, its falling
through and just being sent-- e.g, doing:

think Kaladanis Ione Decadarim

with each of those words provoking a hook which does nothing but
/replace, results in three seperate 'think' commands being sent to the
server.

Am I missing something?

Thanks.

I have a series of macros that represent prayers. For now, when I want to 
use them, I have to open my .tfrc file by hand and read through them.

Here's some sample prayers:

/set prayer1_desc Baby Blessing
/def prayer1 = \
/echo chants in a sing-song tone reminiscent of storytelling. "Wisdom of 
serpent be thine, Wisdom of raven be thine, Wisdom of valiant eagle."  %;\
/echo continues "Voice of swan be thine, Voice of honey be thine, Voice of 
the Son of the stars." %;\
/echo finishes "Bounty of sea be thine, Bounty of land be thine, Bounty of 
the Creator of all."

/set prayer2_desc Plants and garden growth with water
/def prayer2 = \
/echo chants in a sing-song tone reminiscent of storytelling "Water is one 
substance which supports all life. The other lifeblood is the Grace 
bestowed by the One, the Prime Essence." %;\
/echo continues "The practice of praying over food and water is followed by 
those who understand that it will instill them with some fragment of 
Grace." %;\
/echo finishes "In acknowledgement of that, so do I now pray that the 
Messenger of the greenery growing in this place will benefit from the pure 
water I pour to nourish the roots...."

What I would like to be able to do is to type something like /prayers and 
get a list of all "prayers" by name (in this case, /prayer1 and /prayer2), 
and their saved subject/description. Something like:

prayer1	Baby blessing
prayer2	Plants and garden growth with water

Yikes :-)

Seriously, for this problem, I'm actually 'quoting' files rather than 
having a large number of def's with echo's.  It's probably less 
efficient, but a whole lot easier to maintain.

ie:

/def prayers=/quote -S /echo -aCred 'prayers.txt
/def prayer=/quote -S /echo -aCyellow '%L1.txt

and prayers.txt would contain:

prayer1	Baby blessin
prayer2	Plants and garden growth with water

and prayer1.txt would contian the content of your echos so you could 
easily get to them using the /prayer prayer_name macro

I'm adding the .txt to these even though it's not necessary for ease of 
use and editing for the users that use graphical shells and might want 
to edit those files in a GUI text editor vis double clicking on them.

It seems the solution isn't to do just /replace, but to do $(/replace 
...)

The quickest solution would be this:

/def prayers = /listvar -mregexp prayer[0-9]+_desc

The more complicated solution produces the output you wanted to have,
despite the fact that the list of prayers may be random, not sorted.
To get a sorted list you must write a sorting macro or perhaps
set the variables in an certain order. (I haven't tried it.)

/def prayers = \
    /def prayers_help = \
        /while ({#}) \
	    /let tmp=%%1%%;\
	    /test tmp:=%%tmp%%;\
	    /echo $$[substr({1},0,strstr({1},"_"))] %%tmp%%;\
	    /shift%%;\
	/done%%;\
	/undef prayers_help%;\
    /prayers_help $(/listvar -s -mregexp prayer[0-9]+_desc)

Both versions should work with %prayer1_desc, ..., %prayer10_desc, ...,
%prayer100_desc ...

May it helped.

Martin

Hi folks,

I've written a macro as follows:

/def spellup = \
  /if (${world_character} =~ 'veeblefester') %;\
  /then \
    /if ({1} =~ "1") %;\
     say hi %;\
    /else \
     say bye %;\
  /endif

when I attempt to run this macro, i get the error below:

% spellup: unexpected /THEN in THEN block

am I missing somthing here?

/IF statement don't use 'then'
Take out the "/then \"

/if syntax is either:
    /if (expression) body...
or
    /if statements%; /then body...

You want the first, so remove the "%;" and "/then".

Thanx for the help guys..I probably should have looked over the documentation again before posting :( I was just a bit confused by the error message -- the "then block" it referred to was implicit, i suppose,  rather than the /then block that i imagined it was referring to.

SHOULD he remove the %;\ ?
IT's a nested /if statement...
just learning about /if's but i would think that it's needed...

Hello.

As I understand you create a colour trigger to highlight one word in a manner 
something like this:

/def -p0 -PB -mregexp -t'(word1|word2)'

That would highlight word1 and word2 independantly, even if they are in  one 
line.

Now to my question:

1. Do I have to do it that way to highlight two words in the same line? If I 
use more than one /def which only have different keywords, then only one of 
them is highlighted. Something like this

/def -p0 -PB -mregexp -t'(word1)'
/def -p0 -PB -mregexp -t'(word2)'

wouldn't work, because they exclude each other, as I understood. Is that true?

2. How would I give them different colours? Say word1 should be green and 
word2 should be red.

I hope I'm not unclear.. ;)

Mark

Make'em fallthrough:
/def -p0 -PB -F -mregexp -t'(word1)' trigger_name1
/def -p0 -PB -F -mregexp -t'(word2)' trigger_name2


> 2. How would I give them different colours? Say word1 should be green and

/def -p0 -PBCgreen -F -mregexp -t'(word1)' trigger_name1
/def -p0 -PBCred   -F -mregexp -t'(word2)' trigger_name2

Hope that helps.
