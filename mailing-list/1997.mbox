I'm not sure what he means by "sucking CPU time", but if people
use tf to mud for hours on end, yes, the tf process will accumulate time.
It's not degrading performance at all.

That'd be nice.  It's rather easy to do.

I know that on a recent upgrade of DG/UX, TF appears to pull 100% while
running - it appears to be an OS bug, however, where the system is reporting
blocked processes as using CPU time.

HELP! The sysop on this server updated the tinyfugue file to version
alpha 21

I get a stupid @ on the left edge of the screen and in order for me to
put in any command or anything I have to backspace it out. It's bugging
the living hell outta me. Any idea what the heck it is and how to get
rid of it?
it is a '@' highlighted in light grey background. and appears on the
left edge of the screen after every line I type.
If I hit the enter key with nothing on the screen or anything on the
screen, nothing happens. However I can backspace it out.
But I cannot find anythign on what the heck it is.

IT'S DRIVING ME BANANAS!

Thanks./

Mail the sysop, tell them the problem, suggest that they update to Beta 1,
which has just come out.

I would also like to define a set of "hot" keys, similar to aliases in Diku
Mud.  Here is the format I use to define these hotkeys on the mud:

cc cast cure critic
tr cast tremor
bl cast bless

These macros take "arguments" in the sense that I can type "bl Cron" and it
will expand to "cast bless Cron".

Why am I not just sticking with aliases?  Because I'm limited to 5 on the mud.
:-)

Thanks again...

I don't want to think about the other one...that would take work.
However, this one is easy. =)

/require alias.tf
/alias cc cast cure critic

And so on. =)

I'm trying to work out some pretty elaborat macros to "auto-eat" and
"auto-drink" on a Diku mud:

1. When the message "You are thirsty." appears on the screen, I will send the
commands "drink skin" and "cast create water skin" to the mud.  Then, if the
message "You fumble over the correct" appears, I will "cast create water skin"
again.  This last part should be recursive until the spell is cast.

2. When the message "You are hungry." appears on the screen, I will send the
command "eat food".  If the message "You can't find it!" appears, I will then
send the commands "get food bp" and "eat food".  Now, if the message "The
backpack does not contain" is displayed, I will want to "cast create food" 10
times, then send the commands "get all.food", "put all.food bp", "get food bp",
and "eat food".  This macro does not need to be recursive.

I would appreciate it if somebody out there in tf-guru land could help me out.
Please try to make the code simple, as I am a newbie to tf.  Thanks in advance!

Actually, I just tried

/bind cc = /input cast cure critic

and it works perfectly!

I'm working on the other stuff right now.  I'll let you know if I get it work-
ing, and if anyone wants to see the resultant code, I'll post it.

[snip]

yes, but, cure critic requires a target, ie: 
	cc someone
should send 
	cas 'cure crit' someone
to the mud, which it doesn't with /alias :(  I'd really
like to know how to make /alias work with arguments, too.

While I'm at it, is there any way to emulate tintin's /n behaviour (which 
functions the same way as /repeat n does in tf) ?  I'd like, '/5 smile mel' to 
be the same as '/repeat 5 smile mel', for example...

TIA,
	_Adam

Like I said,

/bind cc = /input cast cure critic

Will do just that.  Try it out.

	The binding will expand anytime you type 'cc' even in other
words.  Use this replacement for /alias which allows args:

/def -i alias = \
    /if ( {#} < 2 ) \
        /quote -S /~listalias `/list -i alias_%{1-*}%; \
    /else \
        /let body=%-1%;\
;       The alias_* macro /shifts unless [alias=~"old"] at runtime.
        /def -i -ag -mglob -h"send {%1}*" alias_%1 = \
            /shift $$[alias !~ "old"]%%; \
	    /if ({*} =~ "") \
		%body%%;\
	    /else \
		%body %%*%;\
	    /endif%;\
    /endif


	Or you would be much better off just doing:
/def cc = cast cure critic %*
And typing /cc person to use it.

I would set up triggers that /set <vars> this also have the trigger call a
/def that would then recall it self if
needed.

/set eat=no

/def -i -mregexp -t'You are hungry.' hungry= /set eat=yes%;/eat_drink

/def eat_drink=\
	/if ( {eat} =~ 'yes' )\
		eat food%;\
		/eat_drink%;\
	/endif%;\
;;Here I assume the mud will say you eat something <shug> in witch case you
have a trigger to
;;set eat back to no

I used such a set up for a large hunting script I wrote. works very well.

Works, BUT, if you have, say:
	/bind di = /input cast 'detect invisible'
then it suddenly becomes very difficult to interact with anyone named, say, 
Edith... as it binds to 
	Ecast 'detect invisible'th

Looks like a start, tho...

Try /alias cc cast 'cure critic' %0
this will take whatever is coming after cc as the target.

Why not just use:

	/alias cc = cast cure critic %{-0}

Seems to me like an easier way of doing it to me. 'Course, I'm not a 
TinyFugue-guru, so I may be wrong, flame away if I am. :)

First of all, let me say thanks for all your help.  It's been really useful
thus far.  I've implemented David Moore's alias macro and it seems to be work-
ing really great so far.

Another thing I'm trying to implement is a macro that will cause a delay in
macro execution.  This macro would wait for n seconds before processing the
next command in the macro defination.  Do any of you know how to do this?

For an applied approach at the use of this macro would do consider this.  I
want to take the next line (or two) that comes from the world I'm connected to
and place it in a string variable for comparisons.  While this isn't a direct
application of the macro described in the previous paragraph, it could be con-
sidered an _inderiect_ application ("the next line (OR TWO)").  What I'm aiming
for is two lines, but I may be able to get away with just one.

/recall -w -1 is working so far, but note that this is an immediate command,
rather than a _event-triggered_ command, which is what I'd rather have.

If any of you know how to implement something like this, I'd appreciate knowing
about it.  Thanks again!

I know there have been quite a few answers to this question. However,
with no offense meant to anyone, quite a few seems like a very stupid
way to solve this problem. Some answers pointed it out. Yes, there is
a builtin alias thingie in TF. And it works really well. They are not world
specific, however. Not completely built in either. It's a part of the
TF standard library of functions. namely the "alias.tf" file. Since there
seems to be some confusion in the usage, I thought I'd help out and
give some examples.

First, add this line to your .tfrc:
  /require alias.tf

Then you can put aliases in your files like this:
  /alias cc cast cure critic

This will allow you to typ "cc" just like a normal MUD command, without any
leading slash ("/").
If you want to let your aliases take arguments, these are available as %X,
where X is the argument number you want to use. 0 or * means all arguments.
Note that "all arguments" can also mean nothing at all, if no arguments
are given.

Some examples:

  ;; This will let you use the /alias command without the leading slash
  ;; Like:  "alias tr cast tremor" instead of "/alias tr cast tremor"
  ;; NOTE:  although this works when while connected, files that are loaded
  ;;        still have to use /alias, since aliases only expand at the time
  ;;        a line is sent to the MUD

  /alias alias   /alias %*
  /alias unalias /unalias %*

  ;; Note that the "smi" alias below will work both with and without argument
  ;; "smi x" will send "smile x" and "smi" will send "smile"
  /alias smi smile %*

  ;; An example that will always adress a person by name
  ;; Assumes your MUD has a command "TELL X MSG" to tell person X the text MSG
  ;; "ntell Ben go north" will send "tell Ben Ben go north"
  /alias ntell tell %1 %*

  ;; Another example: get something from a container
  ;; "gf X Y" sends "get X from Y"
  /alias gf get %1 from %2

  ;; This is an example on how to check for an argument
  ;; It checks it it's a typo of "say" or a abbreviation of "satisfied"
  ;; by assuming "satisfied" wants no arguments, and "say" does
  /alias sat /if /test "%*" =~ "" %; \
             /then emote looks satisfied.%; \
             /else say %*%; \
             /endif



Well... That's all folks! I hope this helps someone, somewhat.

Yes, but that keybinding will also expand when you don't want it to,
for example when typing "succubus".  You can input a literal (uninterpreted)
"cc" by typing ^Vcc, but it's still inconvenient.  I suggest a macro:

  /def cc = /send cast 'cure crit' %*

which you use like this:

  /cc someone

If you really don't like that leading "/", use an alias instead.
/alias handles arguments just like macros do, using % expansions in the
body (so that replacement posted by David Moore is not needed, and is
actually less flexible).  Just remember that there is no "=" between
the name and the body.

  /alias cc  /send cast 'cure crit' %*

which you use like this:

  cc someone

Note the use of /send in the alias body.  If you used an implicit send,
like this:

  /alias cc  cast 'cure crit' %*

then "cast" would also be checked for alias expansion (actually, SEND hooks).
The explicit "/send" bypasses the recursive alias check.  It probably would
not have been a problem in the previous example, but the next one would
loop forever if it did not use /send:

  /alias run  /send run away

/def -mregexp -p2 -h'send ^#([0-9]+) ' #rep_hook = /repeat -S %P1 %PR

Then, typing "#5 smile mel" will execut "smile mel" 5 times.
(This was copied from tintin.tf, a poorly documented file that implements
many tintin-like features.)

Well, what I have always done is this:
/alias some_alias some_command %1

Then typing: some_alias foo
to the mud will cause the alias to work with the argument.

As I waited a couple seconds for a message to come up on my favorite MUSH,
the inevitable question flickered through my head - "Down? Or netlag? Or load?"

Thankfully, the message came back a few seconds later.  Probably was netlag.
However, it would be interesting to see round-trip times on the status bar.
I'm not sure how much room is left, but I think we could get away with just
a "last 5 second" average, or if we're really lucky, a "last 5/last 15".

Thoughts?

Jason

A "lagometer" macro would be really cool...  Both for login and while you're
connected.  Any gurus wanna give it a shot?

PS: I managed to get an auto-eat/auto-drink macro cooking.  Anyone want to see
it?

Heya all,

On a completely different topic, has anyone implemented a completely
TF-based descer?  If so, does it work well for you?

The idea that I'm considering is just to reduce the amount of text which
is actually in a MUSH database, which in turn should reduce the amount of
time spent in execution (even if it is only in nanoseconds).  Anyone else
have any more ideas for that?

    I cheat.  I run with mpp in a directory and just have each of the descs
I want as a textfile.  Parse with mpp and a quick /quote.  Rarely do I ever
take anything back from the MUSH or do any MUSH programming that requires
descriptions since I'd much rather edit with JOE than a kludgy
line-interface.

is there any way to change what variables are shown in the visual status
bar? I have seen the question asked a couple times in the list, but dont
recall any answers...

Simple things, like on/off variables so i can see different things on the
fly...i looked at the docs on status and status bar, and didnt see anything
about customizing it (other than turning time off, etc).

point me in the right direction by showing me the docs, or mebbe an
example, please. or, if it isnt possible, tell me that ;)

-thanks

This can not be built into tf, since there is no request tf can send
that will produce a server response that tf can predict.

There's really no point, anyway.  If your response time is bad, then
your resonse time is bad.  Putting a number on it won't change
anything.

Also, if all users connected to your server were regularly sending
dummy timing messages, what do you think that would do to the server's
throughput?

Huh?  Couldn't you build in ICMP_ECHO functionality?  There's tons of
publicly available "ping" code snippets (tho admittedly lots of them are
for nefarious purposes).

As a staffer, it does make a difference, because we don't get sent on
a wild goose chase, looking for a problem with the MU* server when it's
actually net overload.

If it went to the MU* server, could be a bit brutal, yes, but I'm just
thinking along the lines of a single 56 byte packet every second (or
five seconds).  I already do this a lot in another XWindow by running
"ping -s <host>", but it would be quite nice to integrate it.

Not even a response to a WHO request?  Something akin to the macro that
repeatedly looks to see if a certain player has logged on a given world?

Well, this is both true and false.  It helps to know if the problem is local,
network or server based.  Such a feature might be one tool to help figure out
where the problem lies.

It wouldn't be any worse than they above mentioned macro that bombs a server
with WHO commands.

Most places I know of request that players specifically *not* use this
macro, and provide a server-based replacement that is far more efficient,
and often provides some rudimentary list-controls and other "nifty" things
to make it worthwhile to Joe Blow User who doens't know just HOW cruel the
WHO-check can be on a slow network.

A number can be nice, but there are better ways to get it.

No, and it would actually be quite a bit better. But as Hawkeye stated, the
best form (and the form intended for exactly this) isn't possible. Namely,
the ICMP_ECHO request. Why isn't it possible? You have to have root permissions
to do it properly. Take a glance at the permissions on your ping program. It's
SUID root. I *very* seriously doubt most places would be willing to have TF
set up that way.

On a side note: small levels of lag are really nothing new and generally
nothing to worry about. Or, if you ARE worrying, at small levels, you should
be familiar enough with standard network tools to use them to generate stats
over a long period. In the case of sporadic high-level lag, there's one very
simple and easy way to tell if it's the server or your net: /sh ping
That's why it was written. It's made to be froody, efficient, and nice to
servers. It Is Your Friend(tm).

Just wondering if there is a way to define an alias which does two commands.

e.g. a macro that does this:

cast create water waterskin
drink waterskin

I just realised that you can do this:

/alias cc caste create water waterskin%; drink water

At least, it worked for me on 35b1.

Sure it is, just use the "%;" separator:

/alias two cast create waterskin %; drink waterskin


Also, if you want to send many commands to the MUD, just once, do:

/eval command1 %; command2 %; command3 ....

You can make your own status bar by using the /xtitle  command  of the
tools.tf package.

Example:
/load tools.tf
/xtitle TinyFugue ist nett
Will display the text 'TinyFugue ist nett' in your windows title :)


You can display updated strings to watch your current flags, for example
with a bunch of /if's :)

/def ShowTitle=\
     /set titel=TinyFugue:_%;\
     /if (afk=1) /eval /set titel=$[strcat(titel,"_AFK_")]%;\
       /Else /eval /set titel=$[strcat(titel,"_____")]%;\
     /Endif%;\
     /if (AutomaticArmor=1) /eval /set titel=$[strcat(titel,"__Armor")]%;\
       /Else /eval /set titel=$[strcat(titel,"_______")]%;\
     /Endif%;\
     /if (AutoLoot=1) /eval /set titel=$[strcat(titel,"_Loot_")]%;\
       /Else /eval /set titel=$[strcat(titel,"______")]%;\
     /Endif%;\
     /eval /xtitle $[titel]

So your xterm-title would looks something like
TinyFugue:__AFK______________________________

if only your AFK-Flag is turned on 8-)

Howdy,
i remember some posts about problems with passwords being echoed to the
screen .. i though i had saved the solutions provided by this
mailing-list ... but when i created a second character i wanted to try
some of those answers ... but seems either i did not save them or either i
didn't save then at all.....
So if someone, who has all the solutions, could mail it to me i would be
most thankful.

Sven

you're probably thinking about hooks... /help hooks tells you all of them.

I know that on my mac, NCSA Telnet will accept xterm sequences, in other
words, if you resize the window, it will send the corresponding command to
the server as if you were really on an xterm.  This also means that /xtitle
will work in tf.

I dont know offhand if there are any equivalent programs that have the same
feature for PC's.

Hiho Folks.

I like to trigger on a line like
Zeus Street [ N E S W ]
I failed to trigger on the [ ] as tf interprets it as a list.

try: /def -mregexp -F -t'\[([NSEW ]+)\]' = whatever

or, if you don't care about what's in the brackets:

I guess I don't quite get the matching.  I am trying to match this phrase

You are zapped by the Glassteel Shield and instantly drop it.

The thing I am trying to do is automatically pick up equipment when my
alignment changes, and I am forced to drop it.  The name of the
equipment might change, so I am trying to capture the name of the item
dropped, and then have a macro pick it up.
I tried this:
/def -t'You are zapped by (*) and instantly drop it.' getzap = get %P1 
and it isn't working.
I also tried:
/def -t'You are zapped by ({*}) and instantly drop it.' getzap = get %P1
and
/def -t'You are zapped by ([*]) and instantly drop it.' getzap = get %P1 

The questions I have are (1) Am I matching right?  and (2) and I using
%P1 correctly?  I have tried reading online help but it is a little confusing
to me 8*)
Thanks!

You are confisuing regexps and globs.

Globs (the default), are similar to shell filename expansion:
?	match any one character
*	match 0 or more characters
[]	match one character from a given range
Globs are "anchored", that is, they must match the entire line.

Regexps:
.	match any one character
*	match the previous pattern 0 or more times
?	match the previous pattern 0 or 1 times
[]	match one character from a given range
()	for grouping, or %Pn grabbing
^	match beginning of line
$	match end of line
Regexps are not anchored; use '^' and '$' if you want to anchor them.


So what you want to do is this:

/def -mregexp -t'^You are zapped by (.*) and instantly drop it.$' getzap = \
    get %P1

I'm having some strange problems with colors not appearing right
in a /def -P: If I do the following: 

/def -F -PCgreen -t' 10[0-9]+%' perfecthull
/def -F -PCblue -t' [8-9]+[0-9]+%' goodhull
/def -F -PCyellow -t' [5-7]+[0-9]+%' okhull
/def -F -PCred -t' [1-4]+[0-9]+%' lowhull
/def -F -PBCred -t' [0-9]+%' extremelylow

the first macro hilites as yellow, the second as magenta and the remaining
ones seem to work properly. The only other color that hilites correctly is
white, I think.

I know these work properly, since I can /echo -aCgreen foo
which works.

Incidentally, this is matching on output such as the following:
Power setting: 80%
Energy output: 1616
Batteries: off line  16000 of 16000 available.
Allocation:  Helm: 72  Nav: 1544  Batteries: 0
Hull integrity: 100%
                     
Where the two percentages there should hilite as blue and green

It's not a universal problem with color-hiliting, since I have another macro
that correctly hilites a partial match in green:

/def -P0Cgreen -mregexp -F -t'NEW CONTACT' new_contact

I'm running 3.5 a20 on freebsd 2.1.0, for what it's worth

Any ideas?

it might be because you are matching with +s... for example [1-4]+[0-9]+
would match any number of 1-4's, and then any number of 0-9's so 100% would
be matched by this pattern. Take out all the +s.
If you have two percentages on line, it will only match the first ones
unless you also put different priority numbers for the macros... try one
-p5, the next -p4, etc.

It has probably been reported already; but I haven't read all mail on this
list lately, so you can simply ignore this if it is old news to you:

/alias (in alias.tf) doesnt list your aliases properly.
This is because of a typo in the ~listalias macro:
/def -i ~listaliases = /echo /alias $[substr({9}, 6)] %-14

Replacing this by:
/def -i ~listaliases = /echo /alias $[substr({10}, 6)] %-15
seems to fix it.

The problem is that your patterns match more than you want them to match.
"100%" matches both "10[0-9]+%" and "[1-4]+[0-9]+%", and since they
are fall-through, both triggers are applied, mixing green and red to
produce yellow.

Get rid of each "+" to get the desired effect.  You don't want to match
one-or-more of each of those digits, you want to match exactly one.

Well ... when you defined all your macro's to one specific world you could
purge all the macros from that world.
I use the folowing line at the beginning of every world-file.

/if (vampiremacros) /purge -wvampire%;/endif
/set vampiremacros=1
...
<rest of world-file>

So whenever i made a quick change to the macro's and i reload the file all
old macro's are deleted and reloaded. The only thing that is not purged
are the aliases defined with /alias. 
But you can purge those with '/purge -i alias_*'

I am attempting to write a simple irc.tf file that will act as a really
rudimentary irc interface. One thing I need to know is how it might be
possible to force TF to evaluate a control code, such as \001 in octal,
and then send it to the connection.

Believe it or not, you're not the first to try this.  I have tried, and 
succeeded in making TF into an IRC client.  One of these days I may 
re-write it properly and actually distribute it.  My solution was very 
simple; embed a ^A in the irc.tf file, then TF loads it like any other 
character.

Here's my situation.  I have two macro files for two different characters on
the same world.  They each define a variable %WORLD_NAME which contains the
name of the world I would like them to use.  I'm having trouble getting this
variable to be used in -w switches in /def's.

/eval /def -t'You are hungry.' -w%WORLD_NAME = /eat

Works great.  However:

/eval /def -t'You are hungry.' -w%WORLD_NAME = \
        /if ($(/eval /list -i \
	                   -t'*%FOOD_CONTAINER does not contain the food.') !~ \
             '') \
                /eval /undeft *%FOOD_CONTAINER does not contain the food. %%; \
        /endif %%; \
; etc.

does not.  What happens is /eval also evaluates the /list command in the /if
condition.  I've tried removing the second /eval statment (also in the /if con-
dition), and that didn't work either.

HELP!!!!!

I'm having a problem with /gag - here's the situation:

%matching=glob
%gpri=0

I try to do this:

/gag NAME

and it doesn't seem to work.  For some reason, I can't seem to make it gag 
NAME in any way, shape, or form  - what am I doing incorrectly?

Thanks!
Matt

Does anyone know of a way you can take a number such as produced from the
MUSH functions secs(), and using only what's available in UNIX and TF,
produce the string made from a convsecs() call? Short of writing a C
program to do it for you... if that's all that can be done, however, I'll
simple do that instead.

glob matching will only match that string if you're matching that string
exactly... try /gag *NAME*

I think the tf function ftime() will do what you want.

hmm.. maybe -t'You are zapped by .* ?(.*) and instantly drop it.' would
help...

Well, I've found I have to do gag as:

	/gag *NAME*=

if I don't want to see ANYTHING mentioning NAME. The null response *seems* to
 be a requirement...or at least, it works this way for me. Anyone wishing to
 tell me what I've been doing for 5 years, please feel free. :)

This is what I'm trying to do:

/alias foo /def -mglob -t'*whatever*' bar = commmand1%;command2%;/undef bar

The problem is, the alias defines the trigger, then calls cammand2 and
undefins the trigger, how do I get it so all 3 of the commands are part of
the trigger?

try escaping them with % as in %%; ... I'm not sure if that will work, but
I'm on a roll, and it'll have to roll downhill sometime...

I have gotten the matching to work by using this:
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'You are zapped by (.*) and instantly drop it.'
getzap = get %P1

The problem that now arises is that in the example I showed:
You are zapped by the Glassteel Shield and instantly drop it.

Both Glassteel and Shield are keywords for the eq.  Then when it
tries to execute the macro, the MUD thinks I am trying to get a Glassteel
out of a shield, and therefore gives me the error message "The shield is
not a container."  So I figure what I want to do is capture the word to the
left of the 'and' to use in the get %P1.  I know this has something to do
with anchoring, I think, so could anyone give me a suggestion?

Thanks

Luke

I made a trigger similar to:

	/def -ag -t'text' foo = /echo Hi.

Then I try to

	/edit -an foo

But it doesn't clear the '-ag' from the options list of 'foo'. (doesn't
appear to do anything).

I got 'around' the 'problem' by doing

	/edit -aCwhite foo	(or some color)

Is this the intended behavior?

I didn't like the answers you got. I'd prefer this:

/def -p1 -mregexp -t'You are zapped by.*( [^ ]+) and instantly drop 
it.' = get %P2 

This work this way: the pattern inside the paren will match any 
pattern consisting of a space followed anything except a space. 
Since I used a +, this "anything" must have at least one character, 
thus ensuring you'll get a word. Because the " and..." follows the 
paren, that word will be the word immediatly prior to " and...".

The .* right after "by" (there is really no space between by and the 
dot, that was not a typo) will handle the other words (if any).

I'd like to be able to turn off the % Trigger in world whatever messages
for certain triggers, as they activate quite often but I don't need to
know when they do and it's rather annoying. Is there a way I can do this?

Use /def -q.  From /help def:

  -q      Makes the macro "quiet".  If called as a trigger, the macro 
          will not count toward the BACKGROUND hook or the return value of 
          /trigger.  If called as a SEND hook, the macro will not prevent the 
          sending of the original input.  If called as a PROMPT hook, the 
          macro will not remove the text from the data stream.

Is there any way to do this?

Call me odd, I only want to see the 'Activity in world..' messages,
and not have a constant reminder of it niggling at the edge of my

Thanx,

Hey, I'm not sure if this is a tf bug, or if it's a result of something
I've coded, but I occasionally get an error similar to:

% warning: statement starting with 'wh' in /IF condition sends text to
server, which is probably not what was intended.

The command I sent there was "wh thief", which is just a normal mud
command (not triggered or hooked).

I've had different commands give me the error, so I'm not sure what's
going on.  It's not easily repeatable (apparently random) :)

You apparently tried to do something like this:

  /if wh thief%; /then ...

The command "wh thief" is considered true if tf can send the command
(i.e., there is a current connected socket), otherwise it is false.
Usually, this is not what the user intended; users usually mistakenly
use this form to test the result of a command on the server, which is
NOT what this form does.  There are 2 reasons for this:  tf can not
know what (if any) response is generated by a server command; and
waiting for a response would block tf indefinitely.  See: "/help /if".

If you really do want to test connectivity, you can use this form to avoid
the warning:

  /if /send wh thief%; /then ...

No, the format of the status bar can not be changed.

I did intend "/edit -an" to clear attributes, although I can't find
anything in the documentation that says that, so I guess it's not
really a bug. :)  I'll add it to my list of things to do.

I always have a window where I start different chars every now and then,
so I put a couple of '/adddiku's in my config file. 

However, starting tf with the -f<file> option makes it connect to the
first world defined. Is it possible to prevend this ?

So what I want is a window with a couple of worlds defined which I can
connect to when I want to :)

hm.. My problem is that TF actually CATCHES the prompt..
As i can't trigger on the prompt any more i want to delete the hook or 
whatever catches the prompt. I can't find a hook that does the catching..

You prolly have something like this:

/def -h"PROMPT *> " catch_prompt = /prompt %*

Because you have a '>' both at the beginning as the end of your
prompt... etc Change your prompt so it will have a unique character at
the end, and put that character in the /def

Howdy all,

    Am I the only one having problems with the 35b1 help file? The
indexing seems to be messed up. /help <topic> doesn't seem to take me to
the right place in the file.

    Thanks, Chas.

    Let this be a lesson to you all. Mudding all hours of the night  (and
morning) makes you forgetful. =)

    I forgot to mention that I'm using the precompiled OS/2 version from

I fear it really is a bug as I got similar problems. I'm not sure and it does
not occure often enough, but I think it works like this:
The mud sends some text which causes one of my triggers to react. A trigger
with some /if parts in it. In the same time I send a command to the mud, by
hand. It seems as if tf is confused then and uses my command in the /if
part of the trigger ...
As I said it was not often enough, so I cannot be sure.
Believe me, I first checked my triggers, and I really don't know how the
command, and each time the one I just typed, could have wandered into
the trigger text ...
I'm using version 35a20 on a sun, compiled with SunOs but now running with
Solaris  (yes, I know, I should invest some time ...).

Should not be too difficult I think. /alias creates a send-hook, you can
define case-sensitive ones or at least try (sorry, I don't have tf on this
machine, so I cannot test it now). Create any /alias, then look at the
command it created (/list -i alias_<name>). You only have to rename it
as the command names in tf are not case sensitive.

Hope this will work,

I'm not quite sure, but I think escaping the $ (by \$) should help.
Do you want the first /eval to evaluate %FOOD_CONTAINER too? Else you would
have to escape the % (by using %%) too.
/eval will evaluate all it can evaluate ... I think that's the problem here.

I hope this helps,

My suggestion is: copy the alias.tf file from the standard lib and edit it
a bit to make it create "calias":es, which are case sensitive.

Even nicer would be if some switches where added to the standard alias file.
Like -c for case sensitive alias, and -w for worldspecific alias.
Maybe I'll just submit such a file soon, and hope hawkeye exchanges the one
in the standard lib for my file. We'll see if I get the time...

Try something like this, for now: (note, this is untested and may not work)
----8<-----------------
;;; Case sensitive aliases.
; Create command aliases.  Like simple macros, but no leading '/' is required.
; syntax:  /calias <name> <command...>
; syntax:  /uncalias <name>

/~loaded calias.tf

/if ( calias =~ "old" ) \
    /echo Note: you have calias=old, so argument substitutions will follow \
        the old style, where %%1 is the alias name, %%2 is the first \
        argument, etc.%;\
/endif

/def -i calias = \
    /if ( {#} < 2 ) \
        /quote -S /~listcalias `/list -i -mglob calias_%{1-*}%; \
    /else \
        /let body=%-1%;\
;       The calias_* macro /shifts unless [calias=~"old"] at runtime.
        /def -i -ag -mregexp -h"send ^%1 " calias_%1 = \
            /shift $$[calias !~ "old"]%%; \
            %body%; \
    /endif

; note: the parameters below depend directly on the format of the /def above.
/def -i ~listcalias = /echo /calias $[substr({9}, 6)] %-14

/def -i uncalias = /undef calias_%1

I'm writing to see if I can convince you to add 'Virtual Worlds', a
listing of MUDs/talkers, etc to the tinyfugue homepage.

It's available at http://realm.progsoc.uts.edu.au/worlds/

Virtual Worlds has support for a tinyfugue listing as well - it writes
all the worlds in the database to an ftp site in a tinyfugue style
/addworld listing.

I've copied this to the mailing list, for the simple reason that I 
thought the tinyfugue world listing might be of general interest to the 
people on there.  I apologise if this is not the case.

Thanks for your time,
Paul

Hi, is it possible to quote a file and append lines on to the end of 
previous lines, as you can when you /load a file?  My word processor 
wraps lines, and I'd like to program an object (MUSH) offline and then 
upload it, but it has problems with long lines.   Any solutions?

Ok, my isp _finally_ upgraded to 3.5b1, so my progress with the irc.tf
script is coming along a little better. However, along with the upgrade,
the way tf handles unprintable characters has changed. I need it to be
able to catch chars such as ^A or \001, without setting emulation=raw.
I looked around at %LANG and such, but I've never dealt with this before,
so could someone help me figure out how to still have tf catch these
chars while in ansi_attr or print modes?

I seem to have a bug in my tick.tf which happens every time i type
/tick or every time a TICK occurs.
I'm using version tf35a20 but i'm not sure whether the tick.tf i've got is
from that version or an older one.

The error messages i get look like this:

% time: no such command or macro
% eval: expression syntax error: expected operand, found ']'


If there's a version of tick.tf that works with tf35a20 i'd be greatful
if someone could mail it to me. Otherwise, does anyone know how to fix
the version i have.

cheers

Mungo

p.s.
       This is what my version liiks like:

;;;; Tick counting
;;;; This file implements several tick counting commands similar to those
;;;; found in tintin, useful on Diku muds.  To use, just /load this file.

Um, I was trying to define a macro the other day that would grab a line
from the screen if I gave it the number
I did

/def scrab *=/quote /recall #%{1}-%{1} 

and it dumped me and did a core dump and nifty stuff like that... anybody
know what I did wrong and if there's a way to define what I'm trying to
do?

You can't.  Unless emulation=raw, unprintable characters are removed
from the input stream immediately after they arrive.

Hi there,

I want to repeat and discuss, what I once already wrote as 
idea to Hawkeye directly (might have been forgotten already 
again). 
My idea is to improve the backwardsearch in the command 
history. Like in the 'tcsh' a backward search should not show 
the same matching lines again and again if they were typed
more often. E.g. a player types the following:

e
n
eat flesh
who
e
e
w
e
e
n

and starts now a backward-search with 'e'<esc>p than he would 
get 4 times 'e' as result, before he would get the 'eat flesh' 
command.
IMHO it would make more sense, to get the 'e' command only one 
time and at the second time you should get 'eat flesh' command
(because if I don't want the 'e' command at the first backward 
search, you probably don't search for it and should get another
command with your second try.
(NOTE: if you further would search backward I wouldn't mind to
get the 'e' command some time later again (because it appears
still above in the command history list, see example), this
also happens while using 'tcsh' for example. But you would filter
any n-time occurences of the same command (even when commands
typed between them) which IMHO would eleminate probably most of
the annoying backward/forward searches)

You probably will already have encountered this problem too, and
it really gets annoying, when you have lots of similar (and long) 
commands which you have used very often. Then you can decide to
type as much as needed to find the correct line immediately (which
often means you also could type it completely) or to type only
the first letters and search as long as found (which often are
at least as much keypresses as typing it completely)


Second idea to the backward search:
If you start to modify a line, you should be able to search
backward/forward for this new line. Further more this line should
be get to the current input line when stating to change any previous
line. Sometimes you go back to some command start to modify it and
just wanne go a bit to the left or right but miss the right arrow
key and go up or down. This makes all your previous changes undone.
Very uncool and since happening very often this is very annoying.


Any comments, statements, or improvements to this ideas?

 CU,
     Uwe

I'm tring to set up a trig to heal a person when they walk into a room

Now the def for it is
 /def -p1 -mregexp -t'(.*) enters' heal = clw %p1
 which works fine.

But I'm looking for a way to turn it on and off.

What i would liked to have done is

/def healon =  /def -p1 -mregexp -t'(.*) enters' heal = clw %p1
/def healoff = /undef heal

But the first one (healon) interprets the %p1 to be part of its define,
  and since that doesn't exist when i call /healon, it sets heal to be

/def heal = clw

 which would just heal me, which certainly isn't what I want
So is there an option i can pass to get it to treat the %p1 as part of
  the heal macro, or do I need to come up with a better way to def / undef

Thanx

Since 3.5 alpha 21 (10/12/96), adjacent repeated input lines are not saved
in history.  This achieves nearly the same effect.

So, given your example above, your history will contain:

  e
  n
  eat flesh
  who
  e
  w
  e
  n

and searching backward for "e" would find "e" 2 times (instead of 4)
before finding "eat flesh".  This example is not particularly realistic;
you know there are going to be a lot of "e" lines in history, so you would
use "ea" as the search prefix and find "eat flesh" with one esc-p.

Also, I just made a simple change to 3.5 beta 2 (unreleased) so that 
it only finds line for which the prefix is a proper prefix, not an exact
match (since if you typed the whole line exactly, there's no need to search,
just hit return).  In the example above, after typing "e", a single esc-p
would find "eat flesh", since the exact "e" matches are ignored.

This is on my list.

Then later /recalls and searches show the modified line, instead of the
original.  I don't like that.

I suggest using a more specific regexp:

   /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^([^ ]+) enters' heal = clw %p1

The first "^" matches the beginning of the line, so you don't trigger
on "joe says 'bob enters.'"  The "[^ ]+" matches one or more non-spaces.

This is basic substitution.  For each level of evaluation nesting you
want to protect the %, add another %.

  /def healon =  /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^([^ ]+) enters' heal = clw %%p1

See /help evaluation, substitution.

	Use %%P1 -- The touble %% will 'escape it out'...  I used
something similar in the following macro:

;;;; Auto-assist for MUDs.  Not yet completed.
;;;; Doesn't work super-well in laggy connections.
;;;; /assist <person> to assist someone.
;;;; /assist <you> to stop assisting.

/~loaded assist.tf
/set assist=0
/def assist = \
	/undef doassist %;\
	/def -p100 -t'*%1*with*{his|her}*' doassist = \
		/if (assist == 0) \
			/set assist=1 %%;\
			/send assist %1 %%; \
		/endif

/def -p100 -t'*receive*experience*' = /set assist=0


You can see how I %% escape out the % marks. It's not an example of superb
macro coding, but then, I just worry about functioning.

Ctrl+P works on a line by line basis to if you only want to scroll back a
couple of lines (at least it does for me in Linux).

Yeah, I have a question. I'm an Emacs fanatic. I used to be able to use
C-f and C-b to move forwards and backwards through my lines. With the
installation of tf35b1 I lost this, instead it does the equivalent of M-f
and M-b.

This is probably the only program that I use out of all Emacs-capable
shells, editors, etc that do this.

My question is how do I turn it OFF.

Well, that's strange, the version I was using before was 35a21 (and
before that, 35a19), and I never had it do anything different. I've
compiled it on SunOS and AIX and Linux, and it's always done a
move-forward-char when I hit C-f (as opposed to doing a move-forward-word,
which it does now).

I am still new to setting up my TinyFugue macros, but what would be the
best way to set up multiple characters for the same world?  I am currently
using separate worlds defined with the same connection in my .tfrc file,
but it can become cumbersome if I am trying to use additional characters.

I want to use a pre-defined world, load a character name and password, and
then use an automatic login when the connection is established.  (This
would let me avoid welcome-screen spam.)  It sounds fairly simple, but I
don't really know exactly would would be entailed.

Thanks!
-Chris

that's the way I usually do it.. just use two worlds with different names

I'm new to this too, but it occurs to me you that you could do something
like this...

In .tfrc

/addworld -T"diku" aerie Rickus passwd apache.wfire.net 1212
/addworld -T"diku" aerie2 Daedelus passwd apache.wfire.net 1212

/def rickus=/world aerie%;/load rickus.tf
/def daedelus=/world aerie2%;/load daedelus.tf

then enter world by typing the char macro

/rickus

logs you in as your char, then loads character specific macros.
non specific or default macros ( which could still be re-defined )
should be in, or loaded from .tfrc. 


btw.  I am positive that there are syntax errors in my example, for
anyone who wishes to, please feel free to correct this.

Rick

	I have a macro package on my web page for dealing with multiple
characters on the same world where one character tends to follow the
other around. <URL:http://oj.egbt.org/dmoore/tf/>, see ignore.tf.
Apparently it's fairly popular, but I don't use it myself.  So if
anyone's using it and seeing problems, don't assume I know about them
and do report them.

	If you use -Tdiku or -Tlp and similar to define your worlds,
hopefully it will autologin for you.  See /help addworld.

As far as i know, you can put a default macro file for each character:

For example, my .tfrc has a line which is: /load world.tf which loads the 
worldfile, containing all my /addworld macros which are like:

/addworld -T'lp' forest Currawong password 138.25.6.30 3000 
~/tf-files/forest.tf

(the above should all be on one line)

Addworld will take a macrofile as its last arguement, in my case, being 
files in my tf-files directory.

I hope that proves useful.

I use the following for multiple characters:

/addworld -T'diku' av1 Baki <password> avatar.walrus.com 3000 <macrofile>
/addworld -T'diku' av2 Lynx <password> avatar.walrus.com 3000 <macrofile>

/def 1 = /fg av1
/def 2 = /fg av2

To connect to a world use the regular /world <worldname> or 
/connect <worldname> to open the connection between the world and use /1,
/2, etc. to switch between world.

I think everyone is sorta missing the mark here. I could be wrong, but I think
 what Christopher is looking for, is something with the functionality of:

(add shameless plug for MUSH that I'm a wizard on) :)

	/addworld BeliorRising belior.neca.com 4301

Followed by something of the form:

	/addchar BeliorRising Florin pswd
	/addchar BeliorRising Goddess pswd2
	/addchar BeliorRising "Old Drudge" pswd3

So that you don't have to duplicate the site info in your tiny.worlds, and so
 if the address changes, you just have to change it in one place.

It's something *I* certainly would like, but I have *no* clue as to how to
 set it up in a semi-sensible fashion. :) I could probably write a macro that
 would translate the /addchar into an /addworld, but .... 

Christopher? Am I on track here? :)

If you do do this, then make sure you give all your trigs names.
I know someone who played a mud that crashed a lot.
His /addworld had a macro file on the end with trigs in it.
The trigs were unnamed, [ eg /trig *died* = get all from corpse ]
The defines in that file remain active even when the world it belongs to
  no longer is.
Now, bcs the trig has no name, when you reconnect to that world, and the
  macro file is re-loaded, all the standard macros are redefined, but the
 trigs are assumed to be new trigs, and both the old and new ones remain.
A few goes of this and you end up with thousands of trigs all catching the
 same thing. And that slows everything down and is likely to get other
 users really @*#$ed at you.
So give your trigs names [ eg /def -t'*died*' corpse = get all from corpse
  or I guess there is a method using /trig for it too, but I don't use it ]
 that way you only have one copy loaded at a time

I'm not really sure on a good way of doing /addchar tho'

I would suggest something like:
/addworld -T'lp' bobmud bob.bobnet.net 1234
/def bill = /world bobmud%;bill%;password%;/load bill.tf
/def john = /world bobmud%;john%;password%;/load john.tf

The only problem being that i suspect the name will get sent be4 the
connecting is established, in which case it may be worth setting up a hook 
for it.
I cant remeber the define for a hook on connection, see /help hooks, but
 I think it is CONNECT:
/addworld -T'lp' bobmud bob.bobnet.net 1234
/def bill = /world bobmud%;/set name=bill%;/set passwd=password
/hook CONNECT = /send %name%;/send %passwd%;/load ~/tf-macros/%name

I'm not sure is that will work, but give it a try.

I'm pretty sure this is what he's looking for.  Further, I'd like to use
that myself, except I trust my sysops about as far as I can throw them, so
I can't store passwords in my files.  *sigh*

You hit the nail on the head, Pete.  That is exactly the kind of
functionality for which I am looking.  I currently have multiple worlds
set up for each character.  It works fine, but I am just curious if
something along the lines of what you mentioned is possible.

Thanks to everyone who has responded thus far, and I'm sorry for not being
as clear about for what I was searching. ;)

This is a bit off topic, but if you don't trust your sysops enough to put
 your passwords in your private files, then you shouldn't be trusting them
 enough to type your passwords into their system.

Doesn't take much to trap the first 100 characters any user sends on every 
 internet connect, if one has root on a unix system. 

Then again, right now, *I'm* My own sysop. :)

Hi,

I have some problems with parallel worlds too.

I'm playing several characters with different behaviour. This means if 
one of them would try to behave like the other one, he would most 
probably die in his next fight. So the triggers must be different for the 
different characters.

Of course there is the possibility to have several configuration files 
for the different characters, and I'm using this. 

Now I'd like to log in with two such characters in parallel.
They have some triggers and commands in common, like a trigger on 
"you are hungry", but they possess different food sources, so the 
resulting commands must be different.

If I use the -w<world> flag, I can still seperate the triggers. But I'd 
like to be able to feed my characters by command, like /eat. If I define 
a trigger /def -t'you are hungry' -w<character1> eat = <command1> and a 
trigger /def -t'you are hungry' -w<character2> eat = <command2>, the 
second definition will overwrite the first and I cannot feed the first 
character.

Any ideas how to solve this problem?



Another problem: Whenever a trigger in the background world reacts, the 
commands sent by this trigger are sent to the foreground world. Is there 
a way to stop this behaviour without using /send -w<character> <command> 
everywhere? (I'm using tf-35a20, installing another version would not 
cause much trouble for me, if it helps ...)



Thanks in advance,
 
     Susan Dittmar

<GRIN> yep!  If you can't trust your sysop, you're lost!  I can promise
you 
that 99 44/100ths of all sysops would never violate your privacy.  There
is 
always the exception of course, but then you could walk out of your
house 
tomorrow and get hit by a bus.

At this point, an unconnected socket to Avatar exists, but it is not
your current socket.  Your current socket is the same now as it was
before this command; if you had no current socket before, you still
have no current socket.  If the connection to Avatar eventually
completes, then Avatar will become your current socket (assuming you
haven't modified the default CONNECT hook).

> /dc

/dc with no arguments operates on the current socket.  Avatar is not
current, and you apparently had no other current socket.  To close
Avatar's socket, use "/dc Avatar".

> /world
> % connect: socket to Avatar already exists

If a socket to a world is connected, /world will bring it into the
foreground with /fg; if not, /world will open a socket with /connect.
Since Avatar is not connected, the /fg fails (calling /fg directly
would have told you "not connected to Avatar").  Since a socket to
Avatar is open, the /connect tells you that.  At this point, you
can either wait for the connection to complete, or close the socket
with "/dc Avatar".

Normally, I'd agree with you.  Normally.  In this case?  Well, I *used* to
keep my passwords in a file, and, well, one of my sysops (who's still
here) read the file.  Just out of idle curiosity.  And the owner won't do
anything about it, because there's no proof.  In the words of Fox Mulder's
password:  trustno1

Method 1: use an /if based on ${world_name} or ${character_name}:

  /def -t"you are hungry" eat = \
      /if (${world_name} =~ "world1") \
          command1%; \
      /elseif (${world_name} =~ "world2") \
          command2%; \
      /endif

Method 2: write a macro for each world, and a "master" macro that calls
the macro for the correct world:

  /def -wworld1 -t"you are hungry" eat_world1 = command1
  /def -wworld2 -t"you are hungry" eat_world2 = command2
  /def eat = /eat_${world_name} %*

The second method is more flexible:  The world-specific macros can each
be defined in world-specific files to organize them better, and the
master macro doesn't need to explicitly name each world.  Both methods
will execute the appropriate command when triggered by "you are hungry"
or invoked with "/eat [<arguments>]".

I think you're confused.

The Current world is used for the destination of all simple text
commands, ${world_name}, etc.  The Foreground world is the Current
world for commands entered on the command line.  But when a macro is
triggered in any world (Foreground or Background), that world becomes
the Current world for executing the macro.

The only thing that could explain what you saw is if your macro calls
/repeat or /quote without -w:  then the Current world for the
subcommand is whatever world happens to be Foreground when it's time to
execute.  Use -w to make the subcommand's Current world the same as
what was Current when /repeat or /quote was called.

to gag a trigger, define it with the -q option.

you can gag the rest of these by gagging the appropriate hook:
/def -ag -hactivity for example.

Alright so I'm gagging hooks now and that's kewl. However, I can't find 
anything for gagging the following.  I check under /help hooks and didn't 
see it listed.  Anyone know?

It can't be gagged.  Just don't try to /connect (or /world) while
a connection already exists.

If you want to repeatedly try to connect to a world until it succeeds,
use /retry (which is just a macro that uses CONFAIL and CONNECT hooks
to tell if /connect failed or succeeded).

TF logs things just as they come from the MUD, at least when running in
emulation=raw mode. That means colored text will be saved with escape
sequences and all. :-)

Hello.

Is it possible to make a trigger on the std tick counter in tf? It seems
to have problems triggering on text other than the text from the incoming
socket stream.

/P.L.

 Hello all!

 I recently sent a message to Hawkeye concerning a suggestion I had in
logging, and now that I found this mailing list I think I should post it
in here too, along with a new observation.

 My idea is to make /log generate marks in the beginning of lines
generated by the -i and -l switches, such as % or #.

-- Example --
You see a narrow road leading into the forest.
%look road
It's dusty.
#drink
-- End example --

 In the example above, the "look road" was keyboard input, the "drink"
generated by a trigger.

 Also, what I recently discovered was that the output that TF generates
through my triggers is not logged at all, even though I use the -l switch.
(So in the example above, "drink" would not have been logged) Am I doing
it wrong, or is it bugging?

 - Pude

	You can emulate text coming from a mud with /trigger.  The std
tick counter in tf is just an attempt to provide the same functionality
of the tintin tick.  If you want to do automatic things based on the
tick, you can make your own tickon which calls those routines at the
same place it does the /echo %%% TICK.

	Local output via -l is things like `% Activity in world druid',
not text sent to the mud.  If you want triggers logged, have your
trigger /echo what it's doing someplace.

 Yeah, figured that was the case.. What you mean is that I should add
an /echo to every trigger I have, logging it to the log? But what about
when I don't always wanna log my game, just sometimes (to avoid taking up
disk space). Wouldn't it be a lot easier if I could just set a switch in
the /log command? As it apparently doesn't exist, I hope to see this in a
future version.

 Also, it would be a pain to add the /echo thing to over 200 triggers.. :)

Is there any way to have variable substitution inside of a trigger?

Also, does anyone have auto assist triggers for Diku-type muds that
they would be willing to share with me?

I run tinyfugue 35a20 under os/2...
I am a new user, and am having problem with triggers:

/trig You are hungry. = eat ration    --- this works fine, but I need:

/trig You are hungry. = remove backpack<enter> eat ration<enter> wear backpack

Anyone with an idea on how I can do that easily? I seem unable to find a proper character to indicate Enter.

TIA

This is the method I use on a DIKU type mud called Death's Domain
(Deathsdomain.net 9000 - free plug!)

/def -p1 -mglob -t'There was * coins.' groupsplit = split %L2

I also defined a trigger to autoloot when the mob is killed

/def -p1 -t'*experience for the kill*' gac = get all corpse
or
/def -p1 -mglob -t'You receive your share of * experience.' gac2 = /gac
or 
/def -p1 -mglob -t'You receive * experience points.' gac3 = /gac
or 
/def -p1 -mglob -t'You receive your share of experience*' gac4 = /gac

depending on how your mud phrases it.

Now I wonder if someone can figer out a way to sort the list some how.

the List is made up like: Name(##) Name2(##)

What I wonna do is sort the list so that the number within the () is
in order like in: Name(10) Name2(45) Name3(98)

Any1 have an Idea of how to manage this???

Thanks, 
  Bjorne

Is anyone running tinyfugue in os/2 and knows how to change number of lines 
and columns? If I change it in os/2 window settings notebook, tinyfugue will
not even start, ie: it quits right away. The set lines and columns in tfrc file
does nothing as well. Any ideas?
TIA

Which is not at all what I expected (or wanted!). Is this behaviour

	Yes.  /repeat format is "/repeat <switches> <command>"
Your command for the first repeat is the rest of the line.  So, tf
executes the entire command, in sequence.  First the test is echoed,
the second repeat is issued, with a delay, and the end is echoed.
After the delay for the second /repeat expires, that repeat executes
it's command to echo test2.  Think of it as a queue of commands, where
the middle /repeat enqueues a new command _after_ everything else
is already enqueued.  As long as you have the second /repeat in
the middle, anything it does will always happen after the /echo end.


> And lastly, how should I go about making a /delay  
> <seconds> macro? Is is impossible?

	Yes.  /repeat does that.  Like I said, as long as the commands
that /repeat issues don't add more commands to the queue, it'll work.
/repeat -<delayseconds> 1 /echo test1%; /echo test2 %; /echo end


	Maybe it would help us if you told us why you feel you need
a second /repeat in the middle?

How can I supress all the messages tinyfugue generates as it loads,
and then enable it back on?
I was able to make them disappear, but was unable to do the opposite :)

	Actually, you are seeing:
< 1 second delay >
test
end
< 1 second delay >
test2

If you stick them in a macro (or turn /sub on), you'll get the more
reasonable:

end
< 1 second delay >
test
< 1 second delay >
test2


Typing commands into the input window does not cause '%;' to be taken as
a command seperator unless you have '/sub on' or '/sub full'.  Because
of this your command looks like:

Wait 1 second and then do all these three things:
1. /echo test
2. /repeat -1 1 /echo test2
3. /echo end

Although I have not done it before, you probably need to use a cmd file 
to start tf, running mode before tf.  Don't forget to change the screen 
size in tf as well.

(Please note that everything here is untested.)
Yes, it's correct.
As said in other mail, you are starting three commands after one second.
One prints "test", one starts a new delayed command, and one echoes "end".
Hence you see "test", then nothing because you just start a timer, then
you see "end". One second later the timer executes its command, and you
get "test2".

Maybe try something like:
/repeat -1 1 /echo test%; /repeat -1 1 /echo test2%%; /echo end

Here you start two commands:
/repeat -1 1 /echo test
/repeat -1 1 /echo test2%; /echo end

and this produces:
test
<one seconds delay>
test2
end

Which probably is closer to what you wanted. This is due to the extra "%"
in my version. "%%;" gets evaluated, and turned into "%;", saving the
conversion to a command delimiter until the next loop of evaluation,
namely when the second timer expires and runs it's command.

> [...] And lastly, how should I go about making a /delay  
> <seconds> macro? Is is impossible?

Yes, it's impossible to delay the evaluation of a macro.
So, no, you can't create a delay macro. However, you could use the same
technic I used in your little example above. Define a "timer" (a delayed 
one shot repeat) that executes two commands: your first "real" command,
and a new timer. Let that second timer in turn define two commands:
your seconds "real" command, and a new timer. That timer can in turn....
Get the idea? :-)  The problem is you get a LOT of percentage signs
between commands, in the end, and it ends up pretty unreadable.

I guess maybe one could make a variable that holds a string, containing
a number (the delay), and a command, then a new number, and a new command,
etc, and make a macro automatically set up the first command with a timer
with the specified delay, and then let that timer execute the command,
and set up the next timer. This would be self sustaining until the string
is empty. I can't really think of how you would do that, though. And you
would only be able to run one such delayed chain of commands at a time.

I hope I've been of some help, at least... :-)

This is how I do it:
/def -p1 -mglob -t'{*} looks at you.' lookatme = blush %; ' What are you
looking at, %1?

Basically what it does is when JoeBlow looks at me, I blush and say
"What are you looking at, JoeBlow?"

I have a little problem.
I want to have different colours for different things.
But for example 
/def -aCred -t'*smiles happily*' 
doesn't make Player smiles happily. to show up in red
bold text shows up though.
I am running TF in a xterm.
Anyone out there who can help me with this ??

Your XTerm probably doesn't support ANSI color sequences - most don't.
If I want color, I need to run an "rxvt", which is essentially a
color xterm.  Kinda buggy, though.

If you are certain your XTerm can support it, then it may be your 
$TERM environment variable, or you may need to set the $COLORTERM
environment variable.  Hard to say for sure.

There is actually a patch somewhere to make the standard XTerm support
colours, but I can't tell you where it is cos I use rxvt! (Which also has
the advantage of being smaller in memory ... on a Linux box, that can be
a good thing. :)

I know of at least one package which requires TERM to be set to
`xterm-color' before it will display colours. Again, it's hard to know if
it'll help or not.

Personally, I would recommend rxvt anyway, if it's available---I haven't
had many problems with it at all, although admittedly I don't use X at
all /that/ much---but YMMV. Hope this helps.

Right.  You need an xterm-like program that supports color; some I've
heard of include color_xterm, cxterm, and rxvt.

TF doesn't use TERM, COLORTERM, or other environment variables for color.
TF sends ANSI color codes by default, no matter what your terminal type
(which will work on any color xterm); see /help color.

If you run the CDE window manager on unix, the "dtterm" program understands
ANSI color codes.  Don't know if this applies to all versions of CDE, but it
works on Sun's version.

No, that will not solve that problem, because:

* means "zero or more of the character before this one"
               (Here, charatcer can also be a range, like [A-z])

+ means "one of more of the character before this one"
               (same...)

This gives that you should use [A-z]+ to catch a name, if you use
a * instead of +, the trigger will also match "looks at you" (that is,
a line without a name first), and will send "look at" back to the MUD,
which is bound to confuse the MUD.

No matter which one you use, though, you will still end up with
"The red devil looks at you", making the client send "look at The red devil".
If your MUD can't handle that, then you need some additional technics to
avoid sending more then one word. See earlier postings in this list (very
recently, this was discussed) for more details.

 Actually, you don't need to put ([A-Za-z]+) as ([A-z]*) works just as
fine.. The only problem that this could create is if the one who's looking
at you has more than one names, e.g. The red devil looks at you, then the

problem by exchanging the * for a +, but I don't know for sure, as I

 Actually the trigger won't respond on "looks at you", because there has
to be a space before the "looks" for it to trigger.. (Not that I would
expect the mud to send "looks at you" or " looks at you", but in the event
that it would.. :))

 Hmm. Strange. Maybe I've just been lucky, but for me it's always
triggered the first word only.. Which I think it should, as the space
isn't included in the A-z range.. (Or is it?)

True... It needs " looks at you" to trigger :)

Ack! Yes... Sorry... braino on my part. I was thinking ".+" not "[A-z]+".
Only one word will match. Last word should be the one to match, actually...

 Yes you're right, it should. So in this example (The red devil looks at
you) it would become "look at devil", but if we use tha example "The red
devil with red eyes looks at you", we get "look at eyes".. :) Actually we
can't really make a trigger which would know which word to use, unless we
make it REALLY complicated. So let's just hope that devils don't have red
eyes. ;)

I'd like to point out that it's probably a bad idea to make triggers for
things that are likely to come from another player on a MU*. Mainly this
is because if both you and another player have a trigger such as the one
in this thread:

/def -mregexp -t'[A-z]+ looks at you' look_trig = look %{1}

you end look back and forth at each other until one of you figures out how
to stop it.

Just a friendly reminder,
Lothos

	I know this is kind of basic, but I simply can't figure out how I
would pull this off.  What I want to do is keep a log of a world.  Not
just all my TF session, that'd be easy, but actually one log for each of
'LA', 'MM', and 'SQ'. Each time I connect to that world, I want it to
start logging to a file in the directory ~\logs named
'[date].[WorldName]log', where [date] is the current date, and [WorldName]
is the name of the world. Futhermore, I want the first line it logs to be
'Log started at [time]'.  [time], appropriately enough, would be the time
of day.  That way, I could re-start logging when I get disconnected (as i
so often do) and just have a little note that tells me when I started
logging.
	Is this even possible?  If so, can somebody tell me how to do it?

This seemed to work when I tried it out:

/def -F -hconnect logworld = /log -w
~/logs/$[ftime("%m%d%y",time())].%1log%; /echo -w Log started at
$[ftime("%T",time())]

this will make a separate log for every world though.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Following this post will be two TF library files that I wrote for local use.
If you find them useful - great. If not, well, feel free to write your own :)

numswap.tf gained existance when I got annoyed at some of the inherent
limitations of stacks (namely, kbstack). It takes a different approach, using
"registers" that can be swapped with the current input buffer. Currently,
the sequences for Esc-0 through Esc-9 are bound to ten buffers; expanding this
is a fairly trivial operation.

locallib.tf was created when I realized that the /help file on /load and
/require is not *precisely* accurate - /load searches the local directory
as well as the library, while /require searches *only* the library directory.
Since this actually made some logical sense to me, but I really needed to be
able to use a /require-style command for files I didn't want to put into the
system library area, I created a "local" version of /require and /~loaded that
scan the directory listed in LOCALLIBDIR rather than TFLIBDIR.

Both works were derived from TF-standard libraries, but the modifications are
entirely my own work. I'm not going to even attempt to figure out what the
heck copyrights might apply; please have the courtesy of respecting the work
that I did, and give credit where credit is due.

Enjoy.

	In the logs I mentioned earlier, I want to have the input I send
out put into the log with a '> ' in front of it.  How do I do that?  I
thought
/def -F -hsend logsend= /echo > %0%;/@send %0
might work, but it tells me send isn't a built-in.

 Because I got interested in this as well.

	How do I make it log the command I send as well? I tried simply 
creating a second /def and changing it to a /log -i, but this seems to 
log *all* of my commands to the most recently opened file. I want to log 
the command that are just sent to each world. Did that make sense?
	Let me try again. I want commands sent to World_A to be sent to 
the Wolrd_A log file, and command sent to World_B sent to the World_B log 
file, but right now all I can get is all the commands sent going to the 
most recently opened log file.

	vv My files vv

/def -F -hconnect logworld_output = /log -w \
	~/logs/$[ftime("%m%d%y",time())].%1log%; \
	/echo -w Log started at $[ftime("%T",time())]

/def -F -hconnect logworld_input = /log -i \
	~/logs/$[ftime("%m%d%y",time())].%1log

yeah I know. Bastian asked me about that soon after. Something along the
lines of:

/def -hsend sendhook = /echo -w > %0%; /send %0

might be what you're looking for. This echos everything you type though,
but it sends what you type in the world socket with a > at the beginning.
If you don't like seeing that, you can always gag it and I think it will
still be in the log (haven't tried it)

	Just thought I'd let everyone know.  There's a _really_
useful unformatter for writing MUSH code offline.  It's in perl, 
rather than Stephen Amoliter's C program.  If you want it, take
a look at:

Use a send hook and fwrite() (which was added in 3.5 beta 1, get it if
you don't have it):

  /def -hSEND log_world_input = \
      /let filename=~/logs/${world_name}.$[ftime("%y%m%d",time())].log%; \
      /test fwrite(filename, {*})

If you want "> " on the beginning of each line, change that last line to:

      /test fwrite(filename, strcat("> ", {*}))

Also note I changed the format of the log file name to "WORLD.YYMMDD.log".
World is first because IMO it's most important, and the YYMMDD date order
makes them sort chronologically.

	Okay, after being ridiculed to death and pointing out my

I'm here to make amends.  First, I'm gonna cover my butt by saying I
was simply transcribing what Adam was dictating to me over my shoulder.

	There is no Stephen Amolitar (and if there is, he must now 
change his name).  David Moore believes it to be Andrew Molitar, but
he is unsure of that.  In any case, I screwed up, I disseminated 
incorrect information.  I did, however, simply point out the fact
that Adam's unformatter is written in perl as a contrast to (whoever)'s
C unformatter.  No superiority of one over the other was intended.

I believe his name is Andrew Molitor, but I'm a bit hazy on the spelling.
The origional C file was around a looooooong time ago, on Caisr before it
went away, and may still be around on ftp.tinymush.org (not sure) in the
MUSHcode area. There is also a SED version floating about somewhere.
Additionally, for those wanting a "nicer" C program, including a spiffy
man page (yeah, right. It's basic but clean) and the ability to use it
as a pipe filter, or standalone, you can pick up MUNF from ftp.lightbearer.com
under /pub/users/lucifer. All of these handle the same format (which isn't
very difficult, and so far as I know, was origionated by A. M.), with varying
degrees of niceness or extensibility. They have different purposes :)

No, but you can make your own copy of the %TFLIBDIR/tick.tf file, and
insert any command you want where it does the "TICK".

Triggers are not expanded for variable substitutions or anything else.
To make a variable trigger, write a macro that redefines the trigger.
For example,

  /def set_victim = \
      /def -t"%{1} has arrived." kill_victim = \
          kill %%{1}

Then, to change the victim to "Bill", execute "/set_victim Bill".

This will not work, it will go into an infinite loop (or until it reaches
%max_recur).  When tf sends the command "eat food", it does not wait for
a response from the mud; it immediately moves on to the next command,
"/eat_drink".

To make descisions based on mud responses, you must define triggers before
you send your command; after the command, do nothing, just let the triggers
catch the response.  For example,

/def -t"You are thirsty." drink = \
    drink skin%; \
    /def -t"You fumble over the correct*" create_water = \
        cast create water skin%; \
    /def -t"You cast the spell." create_water_success = \
        /undef create_water%; \
    cast create water skin

	Is there a way to change what the 'quiet' flag will gag? 

	I am mostly on MOO systems, and they rarelt use any of the 
triggers that the 'quiet' flag looks at. So if I connect -q, I lose a few 
lines of my status messages untill it hits the 25. I need it to trigger 
off of '*** Connected ***'
	Do I edit some of the code oin one of the libraries? Or do I just 
hope the all powerful Hawkeye will code it into the nest version? :)

TIA

You can write your own macros.  /set quiet=off so you don't conflict
with the builtin stuff.

/def -Ttiny.moo -F -hCONNECT quiet_hook_moo = \
    /def -w -Fp11 -n20 -mglob -ag -t"*" quiet_gag_${world_name}%; \
    /def -w -Fp10 -msimple -t"*** Connected ***" quiet_end1_${world_name} = \
        /purge quiet_*_${world_name}
    /def -w -Fp10 -t"### end of messages ###" quiet_end2_${world_name} = \
        /purge quiet_*_${world_name}

On worlds defined with "/addworld -Ttiny.moo", this will gag 20 lines
or until "*** Connected ***" or "### end of messages ###", whichever
comes first.

Hum.. eeh.. hi there.
There is a thing in IRC called tab-completion, tabkey.irc handles it very
nicely. I'm not using MUD myself, but I understand there is a command
called tell <nick> <msg>.
So what the script does, is that it traps all incoming messages, puts the
nick that sent the message in an array. It also traps all outgoing
messages, and puts the nick I sent the message to in an array. Hum... 
Like.. if I do 
tell continuity Are u there?
and then 
Armageddon tells you 'You're dead, bozo!'

Then the two nicks continuity and Argageddon would be put into an array of
strings. Now, when I press the tabkey, the prompt changes to "tell
continuity" and if I press it again, it changes to "tell armageddon"
and then I just write my message and press enter. (Not very easy to
explain, those of you who use ircII knows what I'm talking about).

Now.. the big question is... is this possible to do in tf?
And.. could someone at least show me kind of how it's done?
I'm not very familiar with the scripting language... but I'm a quick
learner.

Thanx in advance.

I got the priorities reversed.  It should be:

/def -Ttiny.moo -F -hCONNECT quiet_hook_moo = \
    /def -w -Fp10 -n20 -mglob -ag -t"*" quiet_gag_${world_name}%; \
    /def -w -Fp11 -msimple -t"*** Connected ***" quiet_end1_${world_name} = \
        /purge quiet_*_${world_name}
    /def -w -Fp11 -t"### end of messages ###" quiet_end2_${world_name} = \
        /purge quiet_*_${world_name}

(I still haven't tested it, but it should work.)

I think you're confusing your lists again... you probably meant to send
this to MOO-Cows as it's not a tf question. Try using toliteral(list)

Ooooo, didn't know there was a TinyFugue mailing list.. although I 
suppose I should've realized that there must be one.  If someone could 
reply via e-mail as to how I subscribe?  Thanks.

In my worlds.tf file, I know that I can set 'defaults' in the first world
defined for all other worlds. This includes name, password, and MU*
connecting to(? possibly, I don't normally use defaults). But, can I also
set the 'type' of MU* (Tiny.mush, Tiny.moo, etc) as a default? It dosn't
appear I can, but, I may just be typing wrong, I'm still getting used to
'case sensitive' code :).

I don't use default names, and I don't use a default password, BUT, I would
like to configure several of my world locations as 'Tiny.mush' without
having to go through and type it literally 20 times or so!

How can I partially colorize the 'X' in phrase 'X points' where X is a 
positive integer from around 1 through 300.  I would like only the
integer part before the word points to be colored. 
 Thanks

Ed

Hi There,

I have a question concerning evaluation in combination with
the /let and /set command.

(Although the following example has only particularly to do 
with my questions I just what to explain what it finally 
'should' do: I just want to set up a lock file at which I can
check if there already is a TF in use or not. So I defined 
(at least I tried to) the following definition: )

/def test = \
/if /test 1%; /then \
  /let PID=$[getpid()]%;\
  /let machine=$[substr($(/sys uname -n), 1)]%;\
  /sys ln -s %machine.%PID %HOME/.tf.input.history.lock%;\
;;  /echo %? %;\
  /if /test %? = 0 %; /then \
    /echo sucess%;\
  /else \
    /echo failure%;\
  /endif %;\
/endif
 
1. I don't understand that during the let command the functions
   are not substituted. Adding an /echo %PID right after the /let
   would reveal a '$[getpid()]' and not the process number (which I
   thought to find there)
   Sure I can /eval /echo %PID to SEE the result but I can't calculate
   with the variable. (Makes no sense in this case anyway to calculate
   with the process id, just asking theoretically)
   If I understand it right here, ANY /let or /set will store the
   given argument without evaluation it. Can you force evaluating
   anyhow? I didn't managed to do so (also the help left me alone with
   this problem) In this case the variable is only used at one place,
but
   wouldn't using the variable more often also mean that it would be 
   evaluated more often? (which would be very inefficient in some cases)

2. The %? doesn't work in the way I thought. In the given example its
value
   is 1 in any case (although the unix 'ln' command is returning 1 only 
   on failure (e.g. link is already existing) and the help of the /sys 
   command says that the return value of the unix commands are passed to
TF
  
3. To show the value of a '/let foo=$[getpid()]' I have to do an 
   '/eval /eval /echo %foo'. This looks wiered to me, isn't there an
easier
   way to get this evaluated?

All for now, thanx for any hint already in advance :)
  Uwe

I think. That would make it red.

Defining a macro named "test" is a very bad idea, since it overrides
the builtin command.  In this example, your /test calls /test, so it
will recurse infinitely (or until %max_recur is reached).  (You can
always call the builtin with the /@name syntax even if there is a macro
with the same name, but it's still always a bad idea to redefine
"test").  Since you didn't mention this problem, and the problems you
described would not happen with this macro (even if you renamed it), I
must assume you didn't actually try the macro exactly as listed above,
and so there must be other differences which affect the behavior you
saw.  If you want debugging help, you must list EXACTLY what you tried.

Greetings..if this is a RTFM question, please tell me what part of the FM
to read.  I got to a talker called Ancient Realms (birch.palni.edu 5150),
and all wiz + have a * next to their name.  Unfortunately, * matches any
pattern.  Is there any way I can highlight any line with a * at the
beginning?

Sample output of what I'm trying to match:
       * Wilhelm a Oublie de se Souvenir d'Oublier
* Antalya doesn't feel any older :)                Mount_olympus      20 0

Any pointers etc would be appreciated.

use \*. I think it's explained under /help patterns or /help regexp.

    Doesn't the standard regexp escape, IE \, work in this case?

I can't seem to get the date appended or prepended to the filename of the
logfiles, as started by tfrc. This is probably one of those stupid,
repetitive questions that my family will be flamed about for thirteen
generations, but I really can't seem to find out how to do it. 

/HELP!

Okay, here's the deal.  I want to make a trigger so that when someone
named 'Patrick' pages me in world M2 with the line Bork: (.*), I'll
execute %p1.  Simply enough, right?
/def -wM2 -mregexp -t'Patrick pages, "Bork: (.*)"'=%p1
But let's take that a step further.  Let's say I want it to pay attention,
and if the line I get back from that command (that specific command, mind
you) is 'I don't understand that.' (the result of a garbled command),
it'll page Patrick with "Invalid command."
But why stop there?  Let's add in another element.  Let's say I want it to
respond to people named Patrick or artemis.  But still page the correct
person with invalid command.
And, indeed, let's throw in another level complexity -- there're three
messages.  "I don't understand that."  "I fail to comprehend your
request."  "I know what you /meant/, but I'm going to make you re-type
it."  I want it to respond to each of those by paging the correct player
with 'Invalid command.'  How do I pull that off?  The page command is
'page player message', just for reference.  All help will be appreciated.

The problem is that there is not a complete GCC port to Windows yet so it
is much more involved than a simple recompile. I have played with it myself
as a tinkertoy, but decided that the code itself was a little too ugly.  I
have also tinkered with porting TF to Java as an application (Console mode)
but haven;t really seriously worked at it..  

On the GCC side, there is the Congruent port which is no longer being
actively developed and there is the Cygnus Port which is being actively
worked on but appears to be less than complete, and as of yet, I have been
unable to get a complete compile, though I am getting closer.  When I last
talked to Jason, he was closer than I, but I have not heard anything from
him since then.

Either way it will be Windows 32bit only..  it will not work in Win32s or
any version of Windows 3.1 including Windows NT 3.1.

I don't know why the heck you'd want to make a macro like this (since
someone can just spoof your other connection), but here's what I came up with:

/def -wM2 -mregexp -t'^(Patrick|artemis) pages, "Bork: (.*)"$' foo = /def

Sorry about not getting an update out sooner, but things have been hectic
for me. I have changed jobs, and am still getting used to it. I have
gotten all but one file to compile without even a single warning, but the
one file I have left to do is going to take a while as I am going to have
to run the file through the preprocessor and then look through the output
of that. I am going to try and do some more work on it this weekend.

Okay...I've got a very simple trigger question.  I want to set up a trigger
that goes off when someone logs on to a site, but I want it to recognize the
line number that they are on.  When the message ">> (line#) Mortification
has connected to the system." is displayed, I want a trigger that will pick
up the line number and then send the command    .pline# bitch   .  I
basically want an automatic page to Mortification when he logs on.  I've got
this already in my tiny.trig file, and I just can't understand why it
doesn't work.

/def -p1 -mglob -t'*>> ({*}) Mortification has connected to the system.*' =
.p%1bitch.

What am I doing wrong?  I'd appreciate any help you've got.

in glob matching, %1 is the first word matched by the whole trigger (in
this case, >>. ( ) is a regexp thing.
if you want to go with glob, use this:

/def -p1 -mglob -t'>> {*} Mortification has connected to the system.' =
.p%2 bitch.

You could do that with regexps also, but the glob would be faster. But I'll
point out the regexp just so other people won't have to.
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'^>> ([0-9]+) Mortification has connected to the
system.$' = .p%p1 bitch.

What exactly is the difference between the 2 sollutions? When should you use
regexp? Is regexp faster, does it consume less processortime?

Like this trigger I have to automatically pass the MOTD:
/trig *<ENTER>* = /dokey newline

Should I do this with a regexp?

Hiya, I'm trying to monkey about with /aliases, and I can't figure out 
where TF saves them, or even if it does.  I would have guessed after 
looking at the /alias code that it would save aliases in tiny.hook, but 
nope, none there.  I can't seem to keep my aliases between sessions.   
Anyway, my question is:
How do I load and save aliases?

glob is supposedly faster, according to /help patterns. regexps are more
versatile though. "simple" matching is even faster, if you're only matching
a whole line that never varies.

nah, the glob seems ok. Of course, if someone were to say '<ENTER>' around
you while you had that trigger, it could be annoying...

Well... Loading is easy... Just write a file in your favourite editor:

/alias   alias /alias %*
/unalias unalias /unalias %*
/alias   hello  smile%;say Hello, %*

etc...

Then go into TF and invoke "/load filename". :-)

Note that even though I like to be able to define my aliases without the
leading slash while in a MUD, I still have to use the slash when defining
aliases in a file, since it's not something I send to the MUD, and can
therefor not be intercepted by the SEND hook that an alias sets up.

As for saving, I have never been one for trusting any program of TF's type
to write anything even remotely sane to a file, when it comes to saving
stuff I did. I always write my files myself. Just shell out of TF,
invoke an editor on the file, and fix whatever you like, go back into TF and
/load the file. That way you get your aliases in the right file too,
if you like to (as I do), load a diffrent file with different aliases for
every MUD.

Hi.  this may be a stupid question but I have a question concerning a
trigger I am trying to set up.  The situation is this:
When I am grouping with someone and they attack a mob, it says <person>
attacks <mob's name>.
I want to set up a trigger so that when that person attacks that mob that
I automatically attack that same mob.  This may be really simple and Im
just not seeing it, but this thing has been giving me headaches for days..
So if someone could tel me how to go about doing it it would be much much
appreciatd..
thanks for your time.

You can just type them into your .tfrc file, but that can make your 
.tfrc bulky, so making a diff file named (whatever) and just typing
in each /alias, then /load (whatever) *viola!* we have aliases. The
problem I find is that you have to remember all the neat aliases you 
came up with long enough to stick them in *grin* I almost always forget
one or three..and only remember it when I go to use it while mudding, and
it doesn't work :)

(using pico)
pico tf.alias

(will say new file)
/alias cc get all from corpse
/alias xx get coins from corpse%;sac corpse

when all done, save file. Then when you start up TF, type /load tf.alias.

This obviously sounds like a kindergarden explanation to some of you tf
gurus, but I know I can't understand half the answers you give, so I 
decided to give my own, that even us lowly ones could understand.

Good luck :)

just make an /alias (and save it in your .tfrc or an alias file that you 
load) like this:

 /LLL look east%;look west%;look north%;look south.

Hi,

Two other ideas how to save your aliases:

   /save <filename> alias_*

appends all active aliases to file <filename>.

What I'm using is the following:

/def writealias = /log -l <filename> %; /alias %0 %; /log -l off

Here I "mis"use the logging abilities and the listing for aliases via
/alias command. /writealias <aliasname> will append the definition of the 
alias <aliasname> to the file <filename>. The advantage of this version 
is the fact that in your file the aliases appear as you typed them.

I hope this helps :)

Hi,

> I type LLL, and it will: look east %; look west %; look sout %; look north

Two possibilities:
* define a macro called LLL:
  /def LLL = look east %; look west %; look sout %; look north
  You start it by typing "/LLL". That's the vesion with least overhead.
* /load alias.tf and define an alias called LLL:
  /alias LLL look east %; look west %; look sout %; look north
  You start it by typing "LLL". It created a send hook, which is a 
  trigger that checks everything sent to the mud and acts if the text 
  sent matches the alias name, which means some overhead. On the other 
  hand it's easier not to type the slash and I never reallized any slow 
  down from my aliases (not too many though).

I hope this helps,

       Susan Dittmar

Hi,

> Hi.  this may be a stupid question but I have a question concerning a
> trigger I am trying to set up.  The situation is this:
> When I am grouping with someone and they attack a mob, it says <person>

I would do it like this:

/def leader = \
   /def -mregexp -t'^%1 attacks (.*)\$' t_autoattack = kill %%{P1}

If you start grouping, you type "/leader <leader>" telling tinyfugue whom
to assist. This macro then defines a trigger triggering on the (complete)
line "<leader> attacks <the mob>" and sending "kill <the mob>" to your
MU*.

There might be a problem: if the mob is called "a spider", then tinyfugue 
sends "kill a spider" to your MU*. The MUD I'm playing would answer "they 
are not there" :(. I don't know what your MU* will do, and there is no 
possibility to let it work everywhere. One possibility if your MU* has 
the same problem as mine:

/def leader = \
   /def -mregexp -t'^%1 attacks (.*)([A-z]+).\$' t_autoattack = kill %%{P2}

Here tinyfugue sends only the last word of the name of the mud in 
the kill command.

Uh, I just reallize it's difficult to explain this, especially as I'm no 
native speaker. If you don't understand what I tried to explain, feel 
free to ask again :)

Thanks all for the suggestions, I figured out what TF does with aliases: 
it saves them as hooks with the -i (invisible) flag. That's all I needed 
to know...  lets me modify them to add things like -w options and stuff. 
Now I'm wondering why my aliases are looping.  I've tried modifying them 
to include having the output as a /send, and according to the help that 
should do it, but it doesn't seem to. What should I be doing to make sure 
that the SEND /hook can't call itself?

My hook:
/def -p1 -ag -w'rod2' -h'SEND {who}*' whoalias = /send cols 79 %; who %* 
%; cols 1024

It calls itself, and spamms the MUD all to heck, with the cols 79 and the 
cols 1024 messages.  How do I stop this?  BTW, I'm using tf-35b1.

Greetings...

What I'm looking to do, is write something that will go off every X number 
of seconds, and send a message to every world I'm connected to of a
particular type.

Of course this would be easy if /send had a world -T'type' flag/option in
it, but it doesn't.  So, I was wondering if anyone out there might have
any idea how to achive this goal.

Right now, I have written this: /repeat -X Y /send -W @@.  Where X and Y
are numbers.  This of course sends this to every world I'm connected to,
which I don't want to do, I want to send the message to every world except
a world of a particular 'type' that I have specified in my tiny.world
file.

	%; separates commands.  Use:

/def -p1 -ag -w'rod2' -h'SEND {who}*' whoalias =\
    /send cols 79%;\
    /send who %*%;\
    /send cols 1024


The /send on the cols lines is only needed if you have a send hook which
matches that too.

Well, there's two ways that come to mind to get around this. One only works
 in THIS situation, and I tend to use it.

@@ is a null command on most TinyMushes, but not on a lot of other servers.
  Anywhere it ISN'T, I just define (or ask for it to be defined) as such.

On MUCK's, I @link an @action to the NULL.MUF command that's a library 
 function, or ask a friendly wiz to add it to the global defnition of the
 command.

On Mushes and Mushes where it's not defined as such, I define a $@@: attribute
 somewhere.

On MOOs...well, I don't go on MOOs. :) But I'm sure it can be done. :)

On anywhere else? See as per MOOs. :)



The second idea, though, comes to mind at the end of 'help hooks' (as only 
 hooks and triggers do anything with WORLD type, according to /addworld).

It gives an example of:

	/def -t'tiny.mush' -hSEND mush_escape = /send - ${/escape \%[ \%*)

That's designed to escape all occurances of \ [ and % on any line going to
 a 'tiny.mush' world, and then send the escaped line instead, to avoid 
 parser problems (in certain circumstances, like pages and says when you don't
 WANT them to be evaluated).

Well, then, this same sort of thing should be able to work for this problem.

It should be possible to use the SEND hook, to parse out, say @@ from all
 tiny.muck worlds, and send nothing....or send something equivalent if it can
 be found...

Of course, this is just the opposite of what is being looked for...my idea 
 is exclusive, not inclusive, and requires lots of /hooks if you have lots
 of world-types...but, it seems like it should work.

That is, if one of you more erudite types could like, code it up. :) I lost
 track of tf's macro language about version 2. :)

Hi again..  Well I wrote and asked about this question before and got a
response, but unfortunately, the response didn't work the way I needed it
to.  What I need is this...
When I am with someone and they attack a mob it says <player> attacks
<mob.>  There is a period at the end of the mob's name when they start
attacking it...   I tried the suggestions that were sent to me and they
work, but one problem..  Say the mob's name is spider 
it prints out <player> attacks spider. when it tries to kill the mob it
says there is no spider. here. so what I need to do is make the trigger
that will attack the same mob the person I am with is attacking, but
exclude the period from the end of the mob's name so it will do kill
spider 
how can this be done?
thanks for any and all suggestions and responses

	Do they have the 'assist' command?  If so, it might be easier to
take the previous examples and simply have it /send assist %P1 instead of
/send kill %P1...

Hi,

I changed the trigger a little bit, I think now it should work.

> I want to set up a trigger so that when that person attacks that mob that
> I automatically attack that same mob.

/def leader = \
   /def -mregexp -t'^%1 attacks (.*).\$' t_autoattack = kill %%{P1}

You did not quote the old version of the trigger, so any other reader of
this list willing to help would have some troubles ...

Ah, and to quote my own posting, the one with the old version: if you have
questions about this trigger, feel free to ask me.

Hello all!Ww2

I just like to see if any1 else like the idea...P

(It might already be there without my knowlage).P

There is a client for WinNT named MudMaster, I tried it out of
curiosity, and found loads of functionality I lack in TF.ut of

One of the things whas a truly configurable status bar.F.ut of
look at: http://home.cdsnet.net/~ivan/MudMaster/UserGuide/StatusBar.htmlU6w=

And also there is a great way of adding functionality yourself to thetmlU6w=
client by using Procedures, have a look at the following for examples:mlU6w=
http://home.cdsnet.net/~ivan/MudMaster/Procedures.htmlng for examples:mlU6w=

Al in all the only drawback whas that it is written for WinNT and usesmlU6w=
WinNT's console mode very hard, and therefore is not usable on my UNIXmlU6w=
machine. So now I wonder, whould it be a good addition to have such IXmlU6w=
functionalities in TF too, or am I the only soul out there likeing it?mlU6w=

I would like to change my current prompt to somthing better, and 
make the info useable. 

my current prompt reads like this:

        < 0000hp 0000Mn 0000Mv >

I have tried:

/def -mregexp -h'PROMPT ^< ([^ ]+)Hp ([^ ]+)Mn ([^ ]+)Mv >' Set_Prompt =\
        /set Hits=%{P1}%;\
        /set Mana=%{P2}%;\
        /set Move=%{P3}%;\
        /Prompt %{Hits} Hits, %{Mana} Mana, %{Move} Moves 

didn't work ... any one have any suggestions?

Thanx

Greetings.  I was just talking to a friend who uses zMUD, and he has the
capability to order his other character(s) from one command line without
switching windows...

Is it any way possible for TF to be able to do this?  It'd help me in
battles when I'm trying to synchronise my call lightning with my throw..is
it feasible?  I'm only thinking of one TF session, but it would be nice if
it could work across multiple copies..but thats taking it a bit far :)

Why would you need to run multiple copies? You can run more than one
character with tf. To send stuff to another world without switching to it,
just do /send -w<worldname> whatever.

I run each TF in a virtual console, and just switch..it allows me to
control 2 chars at once in 2 different areas of the MUD..

What I always do when i have one character send commands to another is using tell. I have a trigger set to respond to '^([^ ]*) tells you, \'heal me\'$' and
then i have that trigger do something like cast 'heal' %{P1}

Right, "/send -w<worldname> command" (or a macro that abbrevates that)
is the best way.  Having multiple connections in the same tf process makes
it easy to do stuff like send commands to other worlds, or /recall from
any world, etc.

It's possible (but kludgy) to communicate between two tf processes
using SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 hooks, but using one tf process is much more
straightforward.

This will work across multiple tf processes, but having tf tell a world
to tell tf to tell a world something is ugly, inefficient, and
succeptible to lag.

Ok, I'll just learn to mud that way :)  It may just work though :)

yeah, you can just define two worlds at the same place and just run two
characters off of them. I do that all the time.
If you load world-q.tf you can switch between them rather easily, as well.

I have a question about background worlds.  When you are conected to two
or more worlds simultaneously, is it possible to see what is going on in
the background worlds instead of having to switch to them every time you
get an activity in world <name> message?
so say you are in world 1 and someone says hi in world 2 is there a way
you can see them say hi without having to switch to that world to see it?
I hope this makes sense.  If there is a way to go about doing this, can
someone let me know?  Thanks..

sure, just make a trigger in world2:
/def -ag -t'*' -mglob -w'world2' somedumbname = /echo -wworld1 world2>> %0
that will echo whatever comes in through world2 into world1 with the prefix
world2>>. You could also highlight it or whatever.

Well, if you have virtual consoles, then I assume your alt key works. :)  
In this case, using multiple worlds and switching between them is as easy 
as alt-B and alt-F for backwards and forwards, respectively.

Grettings all.

How do I bind the numeric keys 
to trigger n,s,e,w and other directions
it would be very helpful if it can be done

I would like to manipulate the Prompt Hook and use the
information in that Hook 
 
my current prompt reads like this:

< 0000hp 0000Mn 0000Mv >

I have tried:

/def -mregexp -h'PROMPT ^< ([^ ]+)Hp ([^ ]+)Mn ([^ ]+)Mv >' Set_Prompt =\
        /set Hits=%{P1}%;\
        /set Mana=%{P2}%;\
        /set Move=%{P3}%;\
        /Prompt %{Hits} Hits, %{Mana} Mana, %{Move} Moves 

didn't work ... any one have any suggestions?

The world type is Diku, Lp=on, Visual=on
I have also tried:

/set matching=regexp
/def -h'PROMPT ^< ([^ ]+)Hp ([^ ]+)Mn ([^ ]+)Mv >'

This didn't work either.

 I'm not sure if it was like this, but I think it was.. :)

 /def -B'Up' = n
 /def -B'Down' = s
 /def -B'Left' = w
 /def -B'Right' = e

 These will bind the arrow keys mentioned. If you want to bind keys 7, 9,
1 and 3 also, you have to bind Home, PgUp, End and PgDn like in the
triggers above..

 Note that when you trigger these, you will also automatically trigger the
arrow keys in other places of the keyboard, as well as PgUp, PgDn, Home
and End keys.

 You should be able to use KP1, KP2, KP3 and KP4 for keys 7, 9, 1, and 3,
but I haven't noticed any difference. They still trigger pgup's from the
pther pgup key.. Still you can use KP5 for the 5 key.

This is an unfortunate limitation of the "/macro arguments" syntax.
The function syntax has no such limitation, so you can do this:

    /test echo("     Blah, blah, blah.")

First of all, I appreciate the help regarding my previous 'leading blankspace'
inquiry. Now, a question of another kind entirely.

The basics: I have the current version of TF installed on a HP-UNIX system
running X-Windows.

The situation: Two open xterms, a TF session active in each.

The goal: To convey simple string data from one process to the other without
accessing an active world.

I am well aware of the benefits of employing several worlds for one char in 
the same TF session--I use that for my logging filters, for instance--but what
I want to achieve in this particular instance--ie. separate, simultaneously
visible windows displaying different types of output from one character--is not
currently manageable without two open xterms.

Any clues how to solve this one?

well as Hawkeye mentioned the other time, you can signal the other process
with SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 hooks. Maybe you can put your string data into a
file, and then signal the other process to go look in that file for its data.

I use this method occasionally when I log in to my work machine remotely,
to control a tf session I left running on the console.  With

  /def -hSIGUSR1 hook_sigusr1 = /load sigusr1.tf

I can put abitrary commands in the file sigusr1.tf, and make my tf
execute them by sending it a SIGUSR1.  This works fine for occasional
use, but is difficult to synchronize for serious use.

If all you want to do is display some text in another window (no
input), you could use /test fwrite() to append text to a file, and have
another xterm running tail -f on that file.

Okay, I want to have, for each world, whenever they receive the string
'You receive * experience points.', it should store * in an 
independant variable, and send 'worth'.  Worth returns two lines, one of 
which is 'You need * experience to level and have * practices.'  The 
trigger for that should ignore the practices and concentrate on the 
experience to level, telling the group '* exp, * to level.'

Currently, here is the setup:

/def -i -p1 -mregexp -t'You receive (.*) experience points.' exp_trig = \
        /set ${world_name}_exp=%{P1}%;worth
/def -i -p1 -mregexp \
        -t'You need (.*) experience to level and have (.*) practices.' \
        worth_trig = gtell %{${world_name}_exp} exp, %{P1} to level.

However, here is what happens (in world Wisquatuk):

/trigger You receive 50 experience points.
% unmatched %{ or bad substitution
You need 364 experience to level and have 34 practices.
You have 9455 gold coins in hand and 0 gold coins in the bank.

Now, right after this, I check to see if it stores correctly:
/set Wisquatuk_exp
% Wisquatuk_exp=50

So obviously it does.  Is there any way to access a variable with part of 
its name the result of a macro?

Also, does /require need the file to be in the TF library directory?  The 
help says no, but the command will not load the file in the current 
directory, while /load will.

                             ^^^^
I have a feeling you need to make this %{$${world_name}}, and then wrap
the whole thing in a /eval. I could be wrong, though. ISTR doing this
before to fix that error, anyway.

Unfortunately, it appears that it does. I have the following in my
local.tf, to change this:

----------
; Stop /require adding the library path, since /load does it anyhow.
/edit -i require = \
    /if /test _loaded_libs !/ "*{%{1}}*"%; /then \
        /load %{1}%;\
    /endif
----------

This may have problems, but it works fine for me. I don't know why it
wasn't like this to start with, though. Hawkeye?

Hope this helps, anyway,

Hello!

I have got a little problem with triggering text.

There in mud i play are lines what i would like use as trigger 
The input line might be like :

*an Orc* has arrived from the west.

I would like triggered Orc. 
Jet i have used to trigger so :

/def -mregexp -t"Orc" -1=hit orc

it used to work one time once but always i cant be spam my alias for to do
it while its a playerkill mud and if ther are at time many enemies aginst
you its kinda hard to manage.

and then i would like get to work system to follow triggered person 
there was example in /help , but it didnt will work for me.

the enterie text may taken as same like i said above.

*an Orc* leaves %direction.

Just problem is ther that tinyfugue will trap on getting * on trigger he
thinks its like any_text. 

If someone could help me i would be very thankful.

Andrus Oolo.

You appear to be pretty careless with your capitals; regexps are
case-sensitive, so make sure you get them right.  Other than that,
your hooks look okay.

Use /eval to evaluate the line a second time:

/def -i -p1 -mregexp \
        -t'You need (.*) experience to level and have (.*) practices.' \
        /eval worth_trig = gtell %%{${world_name}_exp} exp, %{P1} to level.

After the normal expansion, the body becomes something like:

        /eval gtell %{Wisquatuk_exp} exp, 123 to level.

The /eval causes a second expansion, which expands %{Wisqatuk_exp}, and
executes the command.

Yes, "/help /require" is incorrect.

I was messing around with configuring TF so I could use it locally while 
at Sun, and I discovered the proxy setting..  Since there is no socks 
server, just a simple telnet forwarder, I set it up to use this for 
connections..  However I would like to be able to make "internal" 
connections too, not using the proxy at all...  Is this possible?

I'm curious as to whether any of the commands in this utility could be

be somehow rigged for IRC /dcc transmits?

I have a question regarding messages that tf sends, in particular, when a

Trigger in <worldname> is there a way to gag that message?  I tried /def 
-ag -t'Trigger in*' and /gag 'Trigger in world*' none of those worked.  
Is there something I am doing wrong?  Any help would be greatly appreciated..

try using -q when you define the trigger. Then it won't show that message.

Say, hows that script coming?

I thought about DCC stuff while working on such a script, but never came 
up with a good way to do it..  Recieving MIGHT be possible..  Sending I 
can ALMOST certainly say no to.  The way DCC works is the sending client 
says it has a file to offe, and gives a port number.  The recieving 
client then connects to that port on the sending client, and starts 
recieving the file.  (Hence the name direct client to client)  Since 
listening sockets aren't possible in TF as far as I know, sending is 
right out.  For recieving, you could open it up as a new world, but you 
would need to open it as a raw binary world with no visual output, just 
logging.  It would be easier to write an accompanying C program for doing 
DCC.

The macros below are supposed to take the incoming text from the wolrd, 
and replace it with almost the exact same text. The only difference is 
the addition of a name of the indicated plant. But none of the macros 
below work.

What am I doing wrong?

/def -T"telnet.ice" -Pn -F -t'thick gnarled tree bark' = \
	/substitute thick gnarled tree bark (bascae)

/def -T"telnet.ice" -P -F -t'thin white mushroom gill' = \

I think this depends on your default matching. You didn't specify a
matching style in your triggers, so they are using the default matching.
Since they aren't working, I assume your default is glob (which it is
anyway unless you change it) and so you need to use *'s around the trigger
unless that is the complete string. like

-t'*brilliant yellow flower*'
etc.

with regexp you don't need to do this, but it's usually better to use a
glob (or simple matching) if you can.

It looks to me as if Brack was mostly right, but if you *don't*
use regexp in this case, and surround the search string with
*, then the /substitute statement will replace the entire incoming
line rather than just the desired text, wouldn't it? I've had
similar troubles doing exactly taht with certain /substitutes of
my own...

This is what I am trying to match:

You are holding some thick gnarled tree bark in your right hand and 
nothing in your left hand.

This is what I want:

You are holding some thick gnarled tree bark (bascae) in your right hand

If you actually want to get rid of the trigger message completely, use

/def -ag -h'BACKGROUND'

Internal TF messages can't be gagged, but their hooks can.

Give this a whirl:

/def -T"telnet.ice" -mregexp -F -t'(.*)(thick gnarled tree bark)(.*)' = \

Just an idea, so if it doesn't work, I didn't say it :)

It is possible to write a macro alternative to /connect that unsets
proxy_host, calls /connect, and restores proxy_host (assuming
gethostbyname=blocking).

That's the idea.  But it could be made more efficient by using PL and PR
instead of (.*), P1, and P3:

/def -T"telnet.ice" -mregexp -F -t'thick gnarled tree bark' sub_bascae = \
	/substitute %{PL}%{P0} (bascae)%{PR}

(I also named the macro.  It's always a good idea to name macros.)

Hi again..  
I am sure you are probably getting tired of my questions. but here goes...
Since I run off just a 2400bps modem,naturally I get a lot of lag.  So one
of the things I thought to do to alleviate that is to gag all the combat
messages..  But Im not sure how to go about doing that.  I want to gag
everything from You attack <mob> to <playername> dealt the killing blow to
<mob>. but after the mob is dead to stop gagging things..
is this too complicated or is there a way of doing this?
thanks again..
Cary

I'm afraid gagging them won't do a thing for you in this case.  You'd 
have to stop the mud from sending them in the first place.  If you
eliminate them locally, they will still have to pass through your modem
link.

Hmm, If you really want to remove all attack messages, you probably will
want to use a
/gag you attack*

If the combat messages are more complex, like You decimate the mob with
your deadly slash. Then i am not sure how you could do this other than
to do a bunch of
/gag you decimate*
/gag you eradicate*
etc.

What I would recommend doing if you have long messages is doing a
substitute to shorten them. So where if your attack string would be
something like You Decimate the mob with your deadly slash, you could
make it like this. 

/def -mregexp -F -t'You ([^ ]*) the ([^ ]*) with (.*)' triggername = \
     /substitute You %{P1} the %{P2}

I havnt tried this yet, but it seems like it should work.

Not necessarily - all depends where TF actually is in relation to the
slow link.  I was in the same situation, and it looked like this...

MU* <- T1 -> Internet <- T1 -> Dialup host <- 2400 -> 286 (ugh!)

So in that situation, it made a big performance boost.  That's why
I love TF as opposed to the newer Windoze clients that do similar
things - TF is on the other side of the small pipe. :)

Not if he is using a terminal program at 2400 to access a 
workstation running TF, which seems to be the case.

This is probably a question that I could answer myself via the /help files,
but I've yet to find it.  What I'm looking for is a way to temporarily
suspend tf and execute some commands from my shell.  (Ex: respond to a talk
request)  I've figured out that a Crtl-Z will take me to the unix prompt,
but I've yet to figure out how to resume my tf session.  Any suggestions?

Depends. In the following case, it is very usefull:

Mudder <---------> Provider <--------> Mud
         2400 baud            Fast!

If you call your provider, login and start tf overthere, and have tf gag
a bunch of crap, it saves a lot of junkdata to your home.

When you ^Z it, it'll give soemthing like:
[1]+  Stopped (signal)        tf -n
just type:  fg 1 to restart it.  You can also go :
/sh talk <person> or whatever../sh tells TF to drop you to a shell.

Wasting your school's cpu time... shame on you ;)

Ok, so you should do something like

/def attack_<mob> = \
	/def -ag -t'<mob> hits you.' gaghim %; \
	/def -ag -t'you hit <mob>.' gagyourself %; \
	/send attack <mob> %; \
	/send wimpy <preferred_min_hp>
	/def -t'*the final blow*' fight_over = \
		/undef gaghim %%; \
		/undef gagyourself %%; \
		/undef aiii %%; \
		/undef fight_over %; \
	/def -t'Your legs run away with you.' aiii = \
		/undef gaghim %%; \
		/undef gagyourself %%; \
		/undef aiii %%; \
		/undef fight_over

You may need more sophisticated matching depending on what combat
descriptions your mud sends, of course.  And you should never neglect
the cleanup bit because life is rather dangerous with unexpected gags 
still in place :)

Hiya.

To resume your session, just type fg.

I believe another way to exec shell commands would be, /sh?   And to
resume that, "exit"?   Not sure 'bout that one, I ctrl-z all the time.

I use the Ctrl-Z to suspend, and fg tf to resume.  Just typing fg might 
not work if you have multiple suspended process.  Someone suggested fg 
<PID> so that is basically the same

When you have multiple processes suspended typing fg brings you back to
the most recently suspended one.  To control you first use the jobs
command from the shell prompt.  This will bring you back a numbered
listing of the suspended processes -- numbered 1 to n.  You then use fg %#
where # is the number of the process from the jobs listing.

While all the above mentioned stuff works, i found that doing a /shell
works great, and when you done with all you need to do, type exit.

You'd better type /sh and then exit, not /shell

Hello !

the problem is , at mud im playing is there like war between several races.
and some people who are high levels and have got warpoints can be seen by
names. i woud create an trigger for fall a such named guy arrives and begins 
to cast on me i would flee and target him and go back .. 

Current incoming line from mud looks like :

*Somename the Orc* begins some strange incrantations ...

i would like get target on Somename, 

current definition i did is :

/alias autoflee /def -mglob -t"*%1 the %2* begins some strange"=flee%;\
		exit%;targ %1%;/echo *** TARGET IS NOW %1 ***

what im doing wrong in my trigger ? 
sofar i have managed that * is readed as any char appears but how to set 
TF to undestand line approval *%1 the %2*

Andrus Oolo.

I couldn't understand any of that, but I think I figured out the rest:

In a glob pattern, "*" matches 0 or more occurances of any character.
To match the end of the line that you omitted, you must use "*".

To match a literal "*", you must use "\*" (this is described in "/help
patterns").

To get a literal "\" in a quoted option string, you must use "\\";
this means to get "\*" you must use "\\*".

To get a literal "\" in a nested macro body, you must use "\\";
this means to get "\\*", you must use "\\\\*".

Every time you type "autoflee <name> <race>", your alias will define a
new trigger, but will not delete the old one.  If you give the trigger
a name, the new trigger will replace the old trigger with the same name.

With all these changes, the definition looks like this:

/alias autoflee \
    /def -mglob -t"\\\\*%1 the %2\\\\* begins some strange*" flee_trigger = \
        flee%;\
        exit%;\
        targ %1%;\
        /echo *** TARGET IS NOW %1 ***

Is there a way to open a "dummy" world?  A separate world, that you can
open with /world, that's not an actual connection?  I'm looking to
re-direct (for example) Pern knot chatter to a separate world.  (I know
how to do the redirecting, I'm just wondering about the blank world.)

You can use /echo -w, /recall -w, and other world history commands without
actually connecting to the world.  But if you want to be able to /fg it
to read stuff you put there with /echo -w, it needs to be connected;
try connecting to the echo (7) or null (9) port on localhost for a
dummy connection.

Okay, I've asked this question before, but I've yet to get the trigger to
work right.  What I want is a trigger that will pull a line number from
incoming text and put it into a command.  When

>> (41) Mortification has connected to the system.

comes across, I want tf to send the command

.p41 bitch

to the haven.  Being as such that the line number is different every time
that person logs on, and because the number I want to use is in parentheses,
I haven't been able to make a macro that will work.  Any suggestions?  Thanks

hm I thought this was answered, but try this:

/def -mregexp -t'^>> \(([0-9]+)\) Mortification has connected to the
system.$' blah = .%p1 bitch

that should probably have a \ before that last . silly me...
the whole thing would be >def -mregexp -t'^>> \(([0-9]+)\) Mortification
has connected to the system\.$' blah = .%p1 bitch

although putting an unescaped . would still work... just wouldn't be
specific enough.

Shouldn't that be = .p%P1 bitch

I looked in the special variables but didn't find what I'm looking for...
is there a way to have a define like this, where you are catching lines
from any world of a certain type, but only want to echo to the one world
it originated from:

/def -T"irc" -t'some pattern to match' = /echo -w{ircworld.#} Foobar.

In other words, is there a special variable that stores the world name
that the triggered text came from?

Just use /echo -w Foobar.  The ``current world'' is the world that the
trigger happened on.  You can also use ${world_name} to get the name of
the world the trigger happens on.

Greetings,
  As a user of both TF and LambdaMOO servers, I was wondering if anyone
out there has a file that supports the use of a 'local' editor via TF?
Once there was a nice little file called 'ledit.tf' that when used in
conjunction with OOB Commands and a 'ledit' verb, would allow you to
bypass those dreded editor and in turn use a somewhat easier editor
residing on your local system like PICO, or VI.  (I use VI, and yes I
like it <grin>)
Any help would be appreciated...
Case

BTW, local editing is built into the latest core of LambdaMOO, I just
need to TF portion...

I don't know LambdaMOO servers, so I don't know if this will help.

If I have to edit something, I use the command /joe <filename>, which does
  /def joe = /sh <editor> %{1} %; /load %{1}
(it's always a file with tf commands ...)
If you want to edit something you want to send to the MU*, you can use
/quote '%{1} (with appropriate flags) instead of the /load command.

Does this help?

that works on files, but I think he meant something like auto-triggering
local editing that MOO servers spit out. When you @edit something on a moo,
you usually get something like this (this is just an example):

#$# edit name: <whatever> upload: <command>
(lines of text ending with a .)
.

So you'd want to trigger on that first line, read all the lines up to the
last . and then put that in an editor. Then you'd use <command> to upload
it back to the server and type in lines ending with a .
I had such a script, but I lost it, and I don't really use editing like
that since it's too easy to spoof people and make them shell out into editors.

I read the help files, but it is not clear on this certain matter.

I want to /bind <uparrow key> /dokey recall

doesn't work saying it already exists.  Tried to /unbind <uparrow key>
that doesn't seem to work.
/def -i-b "^[[A" = /dokey recallb doesn't work either...

after 30 minutes of reading help files, I decided I need help

 I dunno if it helps, but I use the following to accomplish the same..:

 /def -B'Up' = /dokey recall

Hi,

> /def -i-b "^[[A" = /dokey recallb doesn't work either...

/def -b'^[[A' b_up = /dokey recallb

works on my machine. Perhaps the space after -b is a problem? I don't know.
And what does ^v<downarrow> give as an answer? That's what you have to put
between the apostrophs.
Try again?

(-B'Up' does not seem to work here :-( )

Some terminals use a different binding for the up arrow.  Try pressing
^V and then the up arrow, this will show you exactly what your
terminal is receiving when you hit the up arrow.

How do you exit the text that a trigger matches?  I have tried to edit it 
by typing /edit -t'NEW TEXT' macro_name 
but all that does is create macro_name
ie /def macro_name = <macro actions> rather than  replacing 
/def -t'OLD TEXT' macro_name = <macro action> with 
/def -t'NEW TEXT' macro_name = <macro action>.
Any ideas?

Thanks
Omicron

I would go the easy route and edit the existing macro directly and
redef it from a file - changing macros in an editor and reloading is
easier than doing it realtime within the client (for me).

However, for that to work well you will need to name all your macros,
triggers, hilites, etc, so you don't end up with multiple versions in
existence all at the same time.  (But this is heavily suggested anyways.)

That is the correct way to do it.  But there was a bug in /edit -t in
version 3.5 alpha 20 (and possibly earlier versions), so get 3.5 beta 1
if you don't already have it.

CHANGES:

3.5 beta 2 (3/21/97)
----------
The LOGIN hook no longer has <character> and <password> arguments; use
  ${world_character} and ${world_password} instead of %2 and %3.
Added /trigger -h, to call hooks.
Added /addworld -p, to make local connections ignore %proxy_host.
Added %connect.  Try "/set connect=blocking" if you have new problems when
  trying to connect.
Added ++ and -- prefix operators.
Fixed possible corruption when redefining world with "/addworld -Ttype name".
Output generated before a synchronous process starts is displayed before the
  process starts.
/dokey SELFLUSH (^[J) does not consider lines with only -aG "interesting".
/dokey SEARCHB and SEARCHF (^[p and ^[n) match only proper prefixes, not
  an exact match.
Improved screen appearance after resizing window, changing %isize, or receiving
  SIGINT or SIGQUIT.
Fixed "/edit -an" and "/edit -P<n>n".
Fixed %hilite.
Fixed connect loop under SOCKS, possibly others.
Fixed bug in handling illegal combination of /def -P and -h.
Improved error messages for syntax errors.

Hello,
Im trying to figure out how to make my login automated again for a
CircleMUD, using LP style login prompts.

Originally a simple:
  /addworld -T'lp' worldname charname password address port

Worked fine. However on my own MUD we've added a prompt that comes before
the name prompt.

Do you support the ANSI color standard (Yn)? Y 
By what name do you wish to be known? doofus
Password: itsmebob

There is what the login sequence looks like, remembering that this is LP
prompts where there is no linefeed after the prompt. The name and pass
prompts are normally handled by -T'lp' fine, however what i'm looking for
is a way to echo 'Y' to the ansi color question, then STILL have the
connect trigger (if thats the term) do its job and log me in.

Anyone know an answer to this? Thank You

Okay, I want whenever I send something to a certain world for it to 
substitute all spaces in the line with %b (literally, i.e. %%b).  I know 
I can use a SEND hook, but how would I do the substitution?  I don't want 
to bind it, since that would prevent NORMAL spaces (i.e. TF commands).

Thanks in advance.

I use -T'diku' for circle muds and it seems to work fine, try it out and if it
still doesn't work, I'll see what my other settings are and send them to you.

Since it sounds like you have some control over the MUD, I suggest
putting the color prompt after the login and password, not altering
the login sequence that everyone and their client expect.

More generally, you can define your own LOGIN hook and world type for
any login sequence.  See the LOGIN hooks in stdlib.tf, and the /help
topics "hooks" and "/addworld".

Looks like tf crashes when you type too fast.
Hitting Enter three times fast will exit tf with

tcsetattr: Bad file number
handle_keyboard_input: read: Bad file number
Exit 1

It may be my (slow) terminal, but I cannot work with this version.
Hopefully this bug will be fixed soon.

Hi,
  I have a line that goes like this:

|  Erfahrungspunkte: 24837 (60000) - Level: "S21" |
                                              ^^
                             And I need this number in a variable

Does anyone know how to do this?

Thanks in advance
schreini

There still seems to be another problem as well: if the screen is locked
(e.g. with scroll lock), then TF starts eating CPU like a maniac -
probably a (busy-waiting) loop that is executed all the time...

hello,

i'm relatively new to tf so all those gurus out there please bear with
me.

what i want to know is, i want to activate a command when something is
shown on the screen.
now, when that screen displays the "trigger" words, it has more than one
line. how do i choose specifically one line in the middle to activate my
command??

[what am i talking about?]
Your local time is 01:23:43 - Wed, 26th March.
Talker's time is 23:42:19 - 25/03/97.
Talker has been running for 20 days, etc....

i want to trigger the "talker's time. if i use
/def -t"Talker's time is 10:??:?? - {*}" action = wash my hair

will it work? if not, can anyone help me out?

cheers

/def -p1 -mregexp -t'Talker\'s time is 10:(.*)' action = wash my hair

That should do the trick.

TF has no idea that the 3 lines are related; every line is a seperate
unit to tf.  Any trigger you make hangs around forever, looking for lines
to match.

It will work, and so will the regexp version posted by techno.

Is there going to be a fix for the latest of the kb entries bug?  This is
where tf locks up when you send data to quickly to the session.

Hi there,

this time no question about a substitution problem (at
least I hope). I try to define a macro, which defines 
a lot others. My problem now is to understand HOW to
end a definition correctly.

Lets have a look at the following short example:

/undef huhu
/undef haha
/undef tt_test
 
/def tt_test=\
  /def huhu=\
    /echo huhu           <- notice NO '%;\'
  /def haha=\
    /echo haha

if I would create a file like this and load it, it would
define 2! macros: first 'tt_test', second 'haha' which I
didn't wanted. I wanted that /tt_test defines both macros
(huhu and haha) when it is called, so I found out that I
have to place a %; behind the first macro, looking like 
the following:

/undef huhu
/undef haha
/undef tt_test
 
/def tt_test=\
  /def huhu=\
    /echo huhu%;\
  /def haha=\
    /echo haha

Now the Macro does the thing I wanted: it defines only 
'tt_test', 'huhu' and 'haha' are defined after I call
'/tt_test'. 

I said this is what I wanted, but not that it seems logical
to me. I would have expected that calling /tt_test
would only define ONE marco like this:

/def huhu=/echo huhu%;/def haha=/echo haha

I understand this as nested macro (haha is defined only if
/huhu is called) but I am be wrong (and I dunno why).

So could you be so kind and make it a bit clearer to me?
Best if you explain to me how to set up a macro like this:

/def tt_test=\
\
  /def first=\
    /echo I should print and define 'second'%;\
    /def second=\
      /echo I should only echo%;\
\
  /def third=\
    /echo I should be defined with macro 'first' but without 'second'

(prettyprinted it a bit so you might see what I want to define where)
Calling /tt_test should lead to 2 defined macros: 'first' and 'third'
'second' should only be defined if /first is called.

Hope to hear from you,
   Uwe

Your problem is the substitution of %; . If you want "%;" to be part of
the macro first (and thus no newline sign in the macro tt_test), you have
to escape it, using "%%;" . (To be more precise: the % has to be escaped 
by %% .) So your macro should read

/def tt_test=\
  /def first=\
    /echo I should print and define 'second' %%;\
    /def second=\
      /echo I should only echo %;\
  /echo now I defined 'first'

I hope I could help you a bit,

On top level, you use %; to seperate commands within a def.
Inside a def, you use %%; to seperate commands within a _nested_ def.
For every level you go further into nesting, you have to add
an extra %.

So the macro you want would be:

/def tt_test=\
\
  /def first=\
    /echo I should print and define 'second'%%;\
    /def second=\
      /echo I should only echo%;\
\
  /def third=\
    /echo I should be defined with macro 'first' but without 'second'

So the %%; in the definiation of first indicates that the def of
second is part of the body of first.
The %; at the end of this def indicates that the def of third belongs
to the body of tt_test, but not the body of first.

As shown above.

A command is terminated by the end of a logical line.  When /load'ing
from a file, a trailing '\' joins the next physical line to the current
physical line to create a long logical line; an alternate way to think
of this is that when /load'ing a command is terminated by a line that
doesn't end with '\'.

/def is just a command that takes some arguments, which are interpreted
as: "[options] [name][=body]".  So it defines a macro named tt_test,
with the body

  /def huhu=/echo huhu%;/def haha=/echo haha

When a macro body is executed, tf scans for '%;', which separates
commands, multiple '%'s, which are replaced with one fewer '%', and
several other special strings.  Everything else is just text (at this
stage).  So when tt_test is executed, tf sees:

  <first command>%;<second command>

where <first command> happens to be

  /def huhu=/echo huhu

and <second command> happens to be

  /def haha=/echo haha

...so macros huhu and haha are both defined.

Now the problem is, what if you really want '%;' to be inside <first command>,
not interpeted as a separator?  Use '%%;'.  The '%%' will be replaced with
'%', and the ';' is just text.  So, if you had changed the body of tt_test
to this:

  /def huhu= /echo huhu%%; /def haha=/echo haha

Then when it was executed, tf would see:

  <first command>

Where <first command> happens to be

  /def huhu= /echo huhu%; /def haha=/echo haha

Notice how the '%%' changed to '%'.

I'll explain a slightly more complex macro that defines A and B.
A defines A1 and A2, and B defines B1 and B2.  Each macro echoes.

It's often easiest to think inside-out when writing nested macros.  First
decide what you want the deepest level to do:  define A1, A2, B1, and B2:

  /def A1 = /echo This is A1

  /def A2 = /echo This is A2

  /def B1 = /echo This is B1

  /def B2 = /echo This is B2

At the next level, you want to define A so it defines A1 and A2; and
define B so it defines B1 and B2.  Since there are no special characters
in the commands above, you only need to separate them with '%;':

  /def A =\
    /echo This is A%;\
    /def A1 = /echo This is A1%;\
    /def A2 = /echo This is A2

  /def B=\
    /echo This is B%;\
    /def B1 = /echo This is B1%;\
    /def B2 = /echo This is B2

At the next level, you want to define example so it defines A and
B.  So you add a '%' to every sequence of '%'s in the two commands
above so they won't be interpreted at this level, then stick the commands
together with '%;' between them:

  /def example =\
    /echo This is example%;\
    /def A =\
      /echo This is A%%;\
      /def A1 = /echo This is A1%%;\
      /def A2 = /echo This is A2%;\
    /def B=\
      /echo This is B%%;\
      /def B1 = /echo This is B1%%;\
      /def B2 = /echo This is B2

Greetings,

I wrote some macros that might be of interest for some of you. In short, 
I put up a queue for commands which I want to be sent to the MUD, but 
which should not be sent immediately as this would prevent me from any 
reactions for quite a while (deadly in a player killing MUD).

Just have a look at them :-) (and to the gurus here: I'd love to hear your
suggestions how to improve it ;-)

;;; I'm MUDding a lot, and I have the problem that on the one hand side I
;;; have a lot of spells I want to keep active all the time (using
;;; triggers), on the other side I must not send too many commands to the
;;; MUD as it is a player killing MUD and I would be stunned too long.
;;; That's why I wrote this set of triggers which make sure that all my
;;; automated commands will reach the MUD, but only a small subset of them
;;; is sent at a time.
;;; It's done like this: Instead of sending the commands directly to the
;;; MUD, I put them into a queue (the variables fifo__*). Then I send one
;;; command ("whisper", you will have to change that most probably) to 
;;; the MUD which has no effect on the game (the other players won't see
;;; anything of it), but has a specific output ("You whisper nonsense 
;;; to yourself !" - this text perhaps must be changed too).
;;; This output now triggers the execution of the first command in the
;;; queue, and another "whisper" afterwards, which again triggers the
;;; queue ...
;;; The command for the queue can consist of a series of tf-commands.

;;; The commands as such:
;;; /fifo <command>     appends the <command> to the queue
;;; /startFifo          starts the execution of the queue
;;; /suspendFifo        stops the execution of the queue
;;; /flushFifo          clears the queue
;;; /echoFifo           echos all the commands in the queue

;;; An example:
;;; /def rest = \
;;;     /fifo say I'm very tired, I need a rest. %;\
;;;     /fifo drop arm-chair %%%; rest arm-chair %;\
;;;     /startFifo
;;; will send "whisper" to the MUD, after the answer returned, it will
;;; send the command "say I'm very tired, I need a rest." to the MUD, and
;;; again a "whisper", wait for these commands to be executed, then
;;; send the series "drop arm-chair", "rest arm-chair" and again a 
;;; "whisper" (three % are necessary here!), wait for the commands to
;;; be completed, and then stop the execution of the queue (as it is
;;; empty now).

;;; I hope you understood what I meant. If not, feel free to ask. 
;;; Here it goes:

/~loaded fifo.tf

/set fifoTop=0
/if /ismacro fifoIsActive %; /then /undef fifoIsActive %; /endif

/def fifo = \

I have question concerning the /watch.tf file.  Well I need to know how to 
use it.  The help on /watch isnt very explicit and so I need to know how to 
use it.  I want to watch for a specific player on a mud so I typed this:
/watch <playername>
and now, like every 10-12 seconds it comes up with Command "INPUTPREFIX" not 
found, type "help" for help.
Command "OUTPUTPREFIX" not found, type "help" for help.
What am I doing wrong?
Oh then after it says command not found it looks like it types out who 
abecause then it lists the players that are connected to the mud..
Thanks for your time, and if this didnt make sense I will try to clarify 
further..

The docs forgot to mention that it requires that the mud have
OUTPUTPREFIX and OUTPUTSUFFIX commands, which your mud apparently does
not.

Technically, nothing.

I believe what it is doing is setting up a trigger on the inputprefix to 
gag everything except that player it is looking for, so as not to bother 
you.  Obviously the MU* you are on does not support INPUTPREFIX and 
OUTPUTPREFIX, so it never receives the proper text before and after the 
command is run.  Therefore, it never begins the gagging of the 'who' 
information, and cannot be used on these types of places without 
reprogramming.

Hope this helps.

Which doesn't mean you are out of luck.  You can write your own version of
this pretty easy without having to use OUTPUTPREFIX and OUTPUTSUFFIX.

Just write a simple dodad that uses the /repeat command every so often to
check the who for a player or players you set in a var.  When they are
found then dump it.

	Is there a way to execute a series of commands upon connecting to 
the socket? ANd I am refering to command for the MUD/MUSH/MOO itself, not 
TF commands.
	I see the [<file>] on the /addworld command, but these commands 
seem to execute before the actual connection to the socket.

Hi, all.

I'm wondering if there's a way I can time a period more precisely
than one second.  The context is a simplistic in-session ping macro,
along the lines of:

/set ping_times=
/set max_ping=0

/def -i ping = \
  /send emote checks the ping times.%;\
  /set ping_start=$(/time @)

/def -i -ag -t'You emote: Socrates checks the ping times.' \
catch_ping = \
  /if (ping_start > 0) \
    /let ping_end=$(/time @) %;\
    /let pt=$[ping_end - ping_start] %;\
    /if (pt > max_ping) \
      /set max_ping=%{pt}%;\
    /endif %;\
    /unset ping_start %;\
    /set ping_times=%{ping_times} %{pt} %;\
    /let sumtimes=$(/sum_list %{ping_times}) %;\
    /let numtimes=$(/num_items %{ping_times}) %;\
    /if (numtimes > 0) \
      /let avgping=$[sumtimes / numtimes] %;\
    /else \
      /let avgping=%{ping_times} %;\
    /endif %;\
    /echo Ping time: %{pt}; avg\/max = %{avgping}\/%{max_ping} %;\
  /endif

/def -i sum_list = \
  /set sum=0 %;\
  /while ({#}) \
    /set sum=$[sum + {1}] %;\
    /shift %;\
  /done %;\
  /echo %{sum} %;\
  /unset sum

/def -i num_items = /echo %#


The basic idea is that you do "/ping", which sends an emote to the 
mud, and a trigger captures the output.  It's only precise to the
second, though, as "/time" gives the current time in seconds.  
Any possibility of getting something more precise?

	Is it possible to have different keybindings for different 
worlds/types? So far I have this and it isn't working.

/def -T"tiny.moo" -B'F9' bind_moo_who=@who
/def -T"tiny.mush" -B'F9' bind_mush_who=who

	All I get is the mush_who binding.

Right.  Bindings don't currently work with -w or -T.  One thing you can
do is have one binding which calls a macro which does an /if check.  But
then you couldn't do the same kind of easy checking as with -T.

However, you can do something like this:


/def -B'F9' bind_who =\
    /let pat=SECRIT CODE WORDZ $[rand()] who who who%;\
    /let pri=$[maxpri - 10]%;\
    /def -T'tiny.moo' -p%pri -t'%pat' _bind_who1 =\
	/purge _bind_who?%%;\
	@who%;\
    /def -T'tiny.mush' -p%pri -t'%pat' _bind_who2 =\
	/purge _bind_who?%%;\
	who%;\
    /def -p$[pri-1] -t'%pat' _bind_whoX =\
	/purge _bind_who?%%;\
	/echo \% No who command set for this world type.
    /trigger %pat


Which will send '@who' to moos and 'who' to mushs.  And spew a friendly
error message on other worlds.

	Ok, I figured out why the 'pri' and 'pat' are needed, but it still 
didn't work. I finally tracked down the problem to that echo line near 
the end there. Forgot to put in the %;\

> 	/echo \% No who command set for this world type. %;\

	Much thanks for showing me how to do this. :)

That's the same technique we used to emulate /if before I added it, but
/if exists now, so why would you do that?  This is much more obvious,
and doesn't have an unnecessary round trip across the network:

  /def -B'F9' bind_who =\
      /if (${world_type} =~ "tiny.moo") \
          @who%;\
      /elseif (${world_type} =~ "tiny.mush") \
          who%;\
      /else \
          /echo %% No who command defined for this world type.%;\
      /endif

I seem to recall somebody posting that they were working on a Win32 port of
TF, and had moderate success with it, but a search of the web comes up dry. :(

Anyone (especially the porter ^_^) recall anythign about this?  I'd love to
act as a betatester, as the home PC has to stay Win95 (blech, ack, spit) so
the fiancee can play Warcraft II, and my home LAN isn't quite up to snuff yet.

List replies are fine - I'm subscribed at my work address.

	I haven't seen or heard of anyone else, but it is
something Im working on right at this very moment. Needless
to say, its quite a pain to port. I think that MSCV++ 4.0
has some very annoying bugs to it that are making things
just a little difficult. I have also tried to build it
using the Cygnus version of GNU Gcc for Win32, and got it
to compile and even run to the point just before it has
to establish a connection. As long as I don't /world it
works, but god forbid I should connect to anything, which
Im sure was the real purpose of Tf.
	Im plugging away at it and I keep Ken updated on
my progress and I know he's not much into Windows so I
appreciate all the help I get from him. I guess I could
send progress reports to the list here if anyone is
interested.

	BTW, I'd say that its about 87% finished. Most
of the files compile without errors or warnings, but
there are three files that my compiler hates.

Actually there are two of us working on a Win32 port.  One route is to try and build 
around the Cygnus Gnu-Win32 GCC Environment.  This is the route the is probably
the easiest and the quickest, but it also requires about a 10 meg download of a 
pretty buggy Run-Time/Development environment and a difficult configuration.  
To make matters worse, the CygWin32 platform is still under heavy development 
itself, so version to version stability is a little weak. 

The approach I am taking is to modify as little as I have to and make it a native 
Win32 Console Application that can be compiled in MSVC, Borland C, Watcom, or
Metrowerks.  This is a more arduous task, but hopefully after I get it working 
once I will be able to give the modifications to Ken and let him decide if he would
like to add the changes into the "Official" version.  That will be at his discretion 
of course.  At the moment, my VC port is still very rough, the hardest part being 
finding the proper include files and of course creating a proper config.h.  The 
other task has been getting the Windows TCP sockets mapped to the UNIX style
calls that TF uses.  Not too terribly ugly, but time consuming.  I don;t expect 
to have anything releasable for a couple of months since it is a part time project
that is going hand in hand with another TF related project of porting TF to the 
Java Virtual MAchine.  Not as an applet but as a command line Java Applicaiton.
This started off as a play project, but the more I work with it the more 
convinced I am that this is the way to go to gain additional platform support as 
this would instantly add Win3.x Win32 (95/NT) MacOS and of course Java based
NC's.

I seem to recall somebody posting that they were working on a Win32 port of
TF, and had moderate success with it, but a search of the web comes up dry. :(

Anyone (especially the porter ^_^) recall anythign about this?  I'd love to
act as a betatester, as the home PC has to stay Win95 (blech, ack, spit) so
the fiancee can play Warcraft II, and my home LAN isn't quite up to snuff yet.

Why not setup a dual boot with Linux or Solaris x86 or BSD. :)

In any event.  I have just about every message sent to the TF list
archived and found this upon doing a quick search.  Hope it helps.

Hmm.  I would love to help in this, but unfortunately I don't have
MSVC++ and don't have the money to go get it.  Looks like you have to
change how some of the file names are read.  I'm not that much invalved
in windows programming being that I don't have any compilers due to lack
of funds.  Oh well I can suggest things anyway.  Oh while I'm writing
this I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a X version of tf
if there isn't one being done.  Let me know if anyone is interested.

Mike

		Well, according to the MSC docs, the Wsock32
functions can use either slash for portability. My version
of MSC has MAC libs too, but I don't have a MAC. It is
reading the lib files like its suppose to.

		This WILL be supported, and if Ken will
let me, I think I'd like to add a '/gui on' option to
make it jump into a GUI window simular to the way
mIRC or zMud looks.

		This is the problem. WSAGetLastError()
says that no address is available and the manual says
that the problem is most likely all 0's (0.0.0.0) in
the addr field for connect(). So Im back tracking
from there.
	According to the Win32 docs, the BSD socket
funcs are supported, but I'm stuffing in WSA** funcs
where ever appropriate and also use #define's to
replace certian funcs.

	There is a version of GNU gcc compiler for Win32
available at www.cygnus.com, look for all.tar.gz (10Meg
as stated in a previous posting). If you want to mess
with that I have the 'config.h' and 'Makefile' to build
that. I almost get the same results with it, it compiles
to tf.exe and then runs until you try to connect. :)

Darrin, 

When dealing with Winsock, Don;t forget that the Open Connection calls
can misbehave in alarming ways, I suspect that your address isn;t 0's at
all but an invalid pointer to the value.  If you would like some help I have
VC 4.3 and VC 5.0 as well as Metrowerks CodeWarrior Gold and Watcom 
C/C++ 11.0

Actually, why not start looking into MAPI (Mail API for Windows)? It's
available for NT4 and Win '95, which is how most mail-related stuff is
managed in NT/95 now. This would be the ideal way to go, if you really
wanted mail support.

This would go nicely with the X version that someone suggested earlier.

Here's the trick: my understanding is that select() can only be used on
sockets under NT/95/3.1(1). Assuming this is correct, TF might be doing a
select on a file descriptor pointing at a file. Try checking that.

	Yes, please help, take all the help I can get. :)

	I'm starting to think that its dropping out because of
when it tries to read from STDIN and the fd's for the STDIN
are not normal. Infact, I added some code that gets the handlers
for STDIN and STDOUT but I just haven't looked into the correct
way to incorperate them into it yet. I did a debug trace and
it dies right after the select(nfds, &readers... I think thats
the code, there is a die() call right after. I think that it
where its getting the 'file not found' or in this case a
descriptor.

Alright,

Now that I have peeked at the code with some debug tools, the problem
lies in the tfselect() in TFIO.C.  Apparently the TFILES handling therin is the problem.  I'll dig some more tomorrow or tonight.  The error msg, is actually generated in main_loop() using the errno, call

Borland C wasn't amused with the tf code so I didn't get very far.  One
question I have after browsing the code and listening to Andy is:  You
said it never connected to the Mud.  Is this true, or did tf never see the
responce?  Do you have a mud server to test this fact?  If you are
actually connecting but not seeing the responce then it looks like the
problem would be select after all.

  Since it sounds like you have some control over the MUD, I suggest
  putting the color prompt after the login and password, not altering
  the login sequence that everyone and their client expect.

  More generally, you can define your own LOGIN hook and world type
  for
  any login sequence.  See the LOGIN hooks in stdlib.tf, and the /help

  topics "hooks" and "/addworld".

I realy don't see why it shouldn't work, we have the same kind of login
sequence
on our mud, and many many of our players use TF, including me. I have no
problems with my auto-logins, though I must admit I don't use the login
hooks :)

Why don't you just load a separet file when initiating a world and that
file contain
triggers for your login prompts and remove themself after used?
That's the way I do it...

Hello!

I have trouble with "normal" keybindings for the Keypad-keys. The
Function keys work good, but not the keypadkeys :(

My problem is that I use different terminals most of the time,
SparcStations and PCs. Donno, if the keycodes are different of not, but
somehow I can't get the bindings to work. It keeps sending the 0-9 chars
with or without the Num-Lock.

I'v tried the same thing with powwow and there it works fine?!

Any1 know a way to make it so when I initiate a command it will ask me
to press
sertain key for binding and then bind it?

Thanks for any help here...

Could someone please tell me where to get the basic commands of 
tinyfugue?  Is there a basic manual (except from the help file)?  I would 
really like to get the triggers to work, but I think I would manage if I 
could get some information to read.  

Thanx in advance!

Having (unfortunately) programmed in windows (and 16 bit windows, at that)
using filedescriptors as I was used to from unix, I think I could at least
give a suggestion of what you might check. The clib that came with MSVC++
that I worked on handled no filedescriptors higher then a certain number.
I think it was 16, or so. The solution was to recompile the libc, which
involved getting an assembler which was as easy to find as a needle in a
haystack. Very frustrating. Anyway... Try checking the max filedescriptors
for the unix-calls, is case you run into the same problem.

I use this trigger, about as simple as it gets!
/def -p1 -t'{*} looks at you.' lookatme = blush %; ' What are you
looking at, %1?
When someone looks at me, I basically blush and say "What are you looking 
at, <person's name>?"

Thank you all for the response. (those of you that provided a productive one)
Joel Bearer, the instance I gave was just an example, actually I am now using
the technique to do a much different thing.
But to contradict you, I have had such a situation as you described above.
It did not bring anyone to their knees, not the mud, not our systems.
Are you playing any muds? Do they run on a 286 cpu still?
Anyway, Thank you for a productive feedback, I hope to hear more
criticism from you. 
I guess I should have asked how to acquire and use an alphanumeric 
word. Mea Culpa.

why not make a global variable and then use /if to see if the same person
was the one who looked at you earlier?

Is there any way of assigning a variable to a certain value or a string?
And how can I implement it into say, commands similar to TINTIN's #math
command...
For that matter, while I'm on the subject, is there a way of assigning the
value of variable1 to the value of variable2, or similar assignments?

Eg. like in basic... x = y... The simplest of assignments...

Many thanks in advance

In my initial tf learning days, I relied heavily on Andy Mortimer's guide at
http://asm21.emma.cam.ac.uk/~asm21/mush/tf-beginners.html, which is good for
discussions of /trig, /hilite, etc - and pointers on how to learn how to do
more complicated stuff.  I also downloaded tf-help (the text file containing
the online help) for reading through offline (grepping it is often very
useful for finding things) - it's in the directory indicated by the command
/set TFLIBDIR.

There's other TF resources at:
http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/
http://oj.egbt.org/tf/
http://fly.ccs.yorku.ca/mush/tf.html

I'm not entirely sure this was the way to do it, but I think "/help set"
should be able to tell you enough at least..

As an example, yes, it's just a bunch of text. The warning is applicable to
all situations where you might trigger an infinite loop situation - of which
your particular example was a case, and other examples might not be.

Yes. Currently, about 10, daily.

Nope. They vary from a Pentium 90 to a large Hewlett Packard multi-processor
machine. However, the "nice" slice of CPU that goes to a single process such
as a game, on many of the smaller servers, isn't that much larger than a 286
either, so perhaps in that light the answer is closer to yes. I certainly 
wouldn't be happy to see one of the five or so MU* on my machine start eating
up 95% of the processor time or blasting the network link because someone on
a T1 with a Sparc to run TF managed to send a couple hundred thousand requests
for a page or so of text.

*shrug* I always figured pointing out a failure point so that it could be
avoided was at least somewhat constructive. Maybe I'll have to go dig out
the old OED and check again.

A much broader question than the example indicated, and one that isn't quite
so likely to gather warnings about potential points of failure, yes.

I've already written to the original poster, but in case anyone else
tries to go get it: it isn't there, as I unfortunately only have
access to a WWW server when it's running on my own machine at Uni,
and at the moment I'm not at Uni, and so neither is my machine.
Hopefully I'll be able to get a slightly more permanent place for
the guide soon as I think my parents are going to change providers
to one which provides WWW space, but for now if you want a copy
please feel free to email me with your preference for:
  o Format (PS, DVI, TXT)
  o Compression (gzip, PKZip)
  o Encoding (MIME, BinHex, UU)
and I'll send you one back.

While I'm writing anyway, isn't there an HTML version of this 
somewhere? I know Hawkeye has (used to have?) this up on his 
homepage, but is there somewhere to get this as a tarball or similar? 
It would be a very useful thing to have locally for people using tf 
over slow connecttions.

Joel,

All I have to say is that the guy that asked for advice should lay off

All of the high level tf functions work in units of lines, and their

The best thing to do here is probably to #ifndef PLATFORM_WIN32 around
the warning.  This way, if the user *does* have a MAIL variable set,
monitoring will still be done.

This is error is from tf, not the compiler.  tf requires that TFLIBDIR
contain an absolute, not relative, path; it checks for this by
requiring a leading '/', '~', or drive letter designation.

I don't like the idea of a gui mode, but you've got bigger problems to
deal with for now.  We can talk about a gui mode later.

If this is because select() does not work on console input, you might
as well give up now.

If this is because standard input is not file descriptor 0, as tf
assumes, then wait for tf-35b4, in which I've replaced all references
to descriptors 0, 1, and 2 with STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and
STDERR_FILENO.  (Even if your platform isn't POSIX enough to define
those, they can be conditionally defined in port.h.)

Is it possible to trigger of of the '---- Recall end ----' so as to
execute a /more off at the end of every recall?
I looked thry the help on hooks but couldnt find a way of hooking
from misc. tf output like this.
Any ideas?

Also maybe it would be handy if tf came set up so that it'd do a
/more on/off at the beginning and end of every recall.
Just a thought.

Thanks

Nice try, but the /more off will take effect immediately.  What's needed
is a way to turn more off after the last line of /recall output has
actually appeared on the screen, and there is no way to do that.

I could modify tf so that /more off while at a more prompt doesn't stop
paging until after the user has caught up.  I'll think about that.

Well, Pude, it's close to what I'm after, but you see, if I /set a
previously set variable, say x, it becomes an internal variable, which is
what I want to avoid... otherwise I will be resulted in a mess of
environmentals and internals and I won't know the difference... I remember
in the "expressions" section of the /help file talking about Assignment...
and I quote...

  v := s  Assignment.  The identifier "v" refers to the variable in 
          the nearest scope.  If not found, a new variable is created at 
          the global level, as if by /set.

Now how does one use the := concept with assigning? And if anyone can
answer the other questions, I'd appreciate it too =)

My vote is for no. I'd rather the old behaviour be kept.

When a name resolution fails upon an attempted connect, why does the
entire connection totally freeze up? I'm wondering if there's any way to
avoid this, because when this happens I can't do anything or receieve
anything for as much as 5 mins sometimes. I can't even suspend tf.

I've been having that problem too. So usually I /set gethostbyname
nonblocking.
But that takes longer for hosts that resolve normally...

I believe this is something to do with how certain versions of unix do
things.  I get the same problem with any program that needs name
information.  I do believe though that you can stop the process and kill
it if you don't feel like waiting.

Greetings,

I'm trying to rewrite the /watch commands for the MUD I prefer. There,
they use something like a pager for the who command, which means I have 
to send one to three newlines after the who command to see the complete
list. Does anyone know how to tell tinyfugue to send a command and 
immetiately 3 newlines? I tried
/send who %; /dokey newline %; /dokey newline %; /dokey newline
but it does not send a single newline :-(

Waiting for help,

      Susan Dittmar

try this: /eval who%;%;%;%; you probably don't need the /eval part from

I am running tf in an xterm under sunos and I can create an ansi newline
by CTRL-V CTRL-M  which looks like an reversed 'M'
If you can't create it on your shell, use a propper editor (VI rulez) to
build yourself a /set newline="M"  <- here the given ansi code
/send M works fine for me.

Probably not the 'best' sollution, but perhaps the fastest (and it works 
fine for me ;)

I'm encountering a problem where tf 3.5 beta 4 is locking up video output
after I connect to my mud.  It looks like it is indenting my screen to
about 5 columns wide, but no output.

Anyone else seen this behavior?  I reverted back to 3.5 beta 3 and I'm ok
again...except the kb lockups.

I'm having a bit of a problem..  I run tf on one machine, but my INBOX
resides on another entirely.  I understand I should just set the MAIl
variable to whatever that path is, but I don't think I've got it in the
right format.

Anyone got a suggestions for me?

I would like to check the type of a world without having to
put it into the foreground. (I want to use this in combination
with the command /send -w.)

This can be done by parsing the output of /listsockets,
but if anybody knows a "friendlier" way, then please let me know.

Greetings,
Johan

This is all inside a /def, of course. The problem is this, I never ever

it's setting a to "rand(2)". Try /let a = $[rand(2)]
also the /send "2 part is outside of the if loop, so it always gets sent.

OK, I'm running 3.5b4 under linux redhat on a Dec Alpha (166mhz).  We were
running the same level under linux 2.0.24 slackware on a P166.

The sysadmin recompile tf (and everything else) and now /send is gone.  He
doesn't know, right off, what this is about.  All the other commands and
macros seem to be present and working.  Only /send has vanished.  When I try
to /send it says "no such command or macro".  The main effect, so far, is to
autologon, but I'm not sure what else might get dinged.

Any clues?

You could just send a random generated number like this:
        
        /def event = /send $[rand(2)] 

If you need a single variable:
        
        /def event = /set a=$[rand(2)]
        /def event = /send %{a}

If you need seperate variables:
        
        /def event = /a$[rand(2)]
        /def /a0 = response 1
        /def /a1 = response 2
        /def /a2 = response 3


Hope this helps.

I got cygnus' gnu-win32, and compiled tf will little difficulty, although
connections wouldn't stay up.  With some hacking around cygwin32 bugs, I
got connections to stay up, but the performance is very bad and some other
features still don't work.  If/when the cygwin bugs are fixed, or another
free unix-like API and compiler for Windows 95 become available (I may try
AT&T's UWIN; does anybody know of any others?), I will make and release a
win32 version of tf myself.  So, there's not much point in other people
working on unix-API-based port now.

Others are still welcome to try to port tf to win32 with MSVC or other
native tools.  However, the biggest problem in any win32 port of tf is
winsock's inability to select() on console input and pipes, and unless you
can solve this problem, you might as well give up.

Is there any reason why when I accidentally hit the Insert button that tf sends 
 = /test insert := !insert
to the world that I'm in?

If there is a logical reason why it does that, is there a way I can stop it
from happening?  I've never done anything to try and set up the Insert key
as a macro button or anything of the sort.

Hmmm... from what I have recently learnt from the assignment (:=)
symbolism, I'd say that your TF is saying the following:

If INSERT key is pressed and "insert" is off then "insert" is on
If INSERT key is pressed and "insert" is on then "insert" is off

So basically what you got there Josh is that TF is recognizing the INSERT
key as a toggle for goodness knows... I would consider this to be a boon
more then a pain in the ass... Think about it, you can use a /def -c100
type macro (it was -c for probability wasn't it?) to monitor any changes
in the "insert" variable... and to activate a certain mode when that
arises... You are very lucky to stumble across this as am I to stumble
across it, as it's answered a question for me which I was planning to ask
the TF-mailer.. :)

Many thanks, and I hope my reply helps... :)

Can any1 tell me why I am unable to /bind any key on the Keypad without
binding
some other keys aswell in the progress? After all the keypad keys are
single keys
with there own keyCodes. Also a great addition to the bind command
whould be a way to actualy bind a keyCode to something rather then what
it sends.

Ok now I have ver 3.5 alpha 16, and I want to give my friend a copy of 
it. I dunno how to set the new version up and needed help. We got it 
transferred and all but not all things went to his account, when it ran 
it was still searching my account. Is there anything we can do other than 
get the new version?.

Peace
-Mike

the directories and all that tf searches for are compiled in the binary,
aren't they? at least you had the same os type so it would run, but it
might be better to compile it on your friend's account if that account has
compiler privileges. In most cases all you have to do is untar it into a
directory and type unixmake (or sh unixmake). if you have to use that same
binary, then you can just set your TFLIBRARY environment variable to where
you copied the tf-lib directory to before you start tf.

Why do ansi colors seem to only work in tf.34a16?  I have yet to load
up any new tf.35a's after 11 because everytime I loaded them, my ansi
color macros didnt work...something such as:
/echo -w \033[0;33;41mTEST\033[0m
works fine on tf.34a16, but apparently no other version unless ive done
something terribly wrong..
please assist
thanks,

You need to /set emulation raw first if you want to send color strings like
that. This will let any arbitrary ansi codes come through, so you might be
open to bombs and the like. I usually use something like:

/def rawecho = /let emutemp=%emulation%; /set emulation raw%; /echo %0%;
/set emulation %emutemp

although this won't work if you have it as a trigger and --More-- shows up.

hi
I have a problem that I need help with.
On my account, tf is set up to be on eastern time.  I would like it to be 
set on mountain standard time.  I have read all the help files that deal 
with time and timezones, etc.  but I cant figure out how to change the 
timezone can someone help?  thanks.

you should set your TZ environment variable before you enter tf.
a sample command for this is:
setenv TZ MST7MDT
in your login script.

This was due to a typo in some versions of tf; it's supposed to toggle the
value of the %insert variable.  Either get the current version of tf, or
delete the extra '=' in the definition of the Insert key in the tf library.

The concept of keycodes generally only makes sense on a machine's
console.  Tf runs in a terminal, which can receive only characters; it
can't distinguish between a keypad digit and a normal digit.  The only
way to do what you want is to use NumLock or other local modifiers to
make the keypad keys transmit different characters, which you can bind
in tf.

It's easier to just install from scratch than for me to tell you the things
you need to change.  On the other hand, if you and your friend's accounts
are on the same machine or filesystem, he can use your copy; all you have
to do is make sure your tf has execute permission and tf-lib has read
permission.

The correct way to echo with attributes/colors is with /echo -a, like this:
"/echo -aCyellow -aCbgred TEST".  See /help echo, attributes, color.

"/set emulation=raw" will allow codes to pass through to the screen
uninterpreted by tf, which would (probably) produce the desired effects
from your original command, but also has many undesirable effects on
word wrapping, triggers, etc.  I recommend keeping the default value of
emulation=ansi_attr.

BTW, the next version will most likely have a way to change echo attributes
at any point in the line.  A command like
  /echo -p @{uCred}Danger@{n} Will Robinson!
will result in the word "Danger" being underlined and red.  (I'm open to
suggestions for other syntax).

Oh, how come other clients can handle this things then? an example is
Powwow and Cancan,
I don't know how, but they sure can bind the keypad without binding
other keys. The problem
in my case is that I need to load files on the fly, and neather powwow
or cancan can handle that.

In the basic, Yes, TF runs in a terminal. But most TF users run it in a
xterminal, since it's a UNIX
env. application. In a xterminal the keycodes are handled byt the
xserver and there fore have a meening.
and yes I have tried remap the keypad to something else with xmodmap.
and yes I can make it do things
in even more clients, like tintin++ and such, but still TF don't care...
how ever I set it up TF just don't care
about the /bind's for the keypads. I have tried on a Sparc and on PC's,
even on the console of my host.

There sure has to be someway to fix this?!

Most of the mudders I know of like to have the keypad maped for walking
with.
(i.e. KP_8 = North, KP_2 = South, KP_4 = West, KP_6 = East)
This is default behaviour of most /bind capable clients.

I'm not familiar with those programs, but they must use interfaces beyond
the simple unix terminal driver, such as X or Windows.

Many, perhaps, (including myself), but I wouldn't say "most".  There are
also many users who dial out from a dos/windows box to to a unix server
where they run tf, and possibly a fair number who telnet to a unix server
to run tf.

But tf is not an X application, it is strictly termios/termio/sgtty.
Supporting keycodes is not worth the effort required to add X support.
In the unlikely event that I add X support for other reasons, I would
also include keycodes, but don't hold your breath.

That would be a great extension indeed. I suppose (make that: hope)
that multiple partial highlites (-P) will be possible then as well?

The syntax is fine. However a nested syntax would be nice as well
(something like "/echo -p @uCred{Danger} Will Robinson!" for the above);
but I suppose this is less efficient and a bit harder to implement...

The -p (maybe -A would make more sense) is just to tell /echo to look for
the @ strings; any number of @ strings are allowed.

I tend to think of them like "change this attribute", instead of pairs like
"use this attribute from here... to here."

I think I'll add ~ to turn selected attributes off, instead of just
@{n} to turn everything off:

/echo -p @{u}foo@{r}bar@{~u}baz

would echo underlined 'foo'; reversed underlined 'bar'; and reversed 'baz'.

Yes, that would be very good indeed.  Actually, that's how I expected
attributes to work before I read the documentation.

I've been patiently waiting to hear these words. :)  While I'm not a
super-duper fan of Windows anything, I have to admit, running on
a Win95 platform is kinda nice, especially when you can so easily
have multiple windows up and running, etc.  Not easy to do with a
shell account on a Unix machine, otherwise.  And, much as I
would like to get a Linux partition working, I've not been successful
in getting an Xwindows partition running.  Kinda blows the multiple
windows theory.

Thanks, Ken, I'll be quite interested in knowing the progress from
here on out of Tf-Win95. :)

I have to now move all my accounts stuff to another directory would there 
be a problem running tf in then new location?
And how can I set his up to do what mine does as far as his /addworld 
and triggers because somehow his deletes his worlds.

Thank you for all of you that replied to my post on porting tf to X
windows.  It seems like there are at least a few out there that are
interested in this.  I will see what I can do.  I'm not all that familiar
with the tf code in depth so this will take me quite a long time to get
even a beginning version out.  I am also limited in the time I have to
work on it which is another negative to the project.  I will do the best
to get what I can done.  Let me know any suggestions any of you have in
what you would like to see included.

Mike

Hi.  I want to set up a trigger that does this.
When in combat, when my hit points go below a certain level, I want a 
trigger to go off that makes me type 'quaff potion' so I can heal.  is that 
possible?  If it is possible, could someone tell me how to go about doing it
?  thanks lots.

At first you'll have to define a prompt hook that reads your hitpoints
into a variable. On each prompt the macro /checkheal is then called.
The problem is normally to wait until one try to heal has been fulfilled.
Just look below and look at how that /checkheal works.

/def -mregexp -h'PROMPT ^.* (-?[0-9]*)H ([0-9]*)M.*' readprompt =\
 /set hit %P1 %; /set mana %P2 %; /checkheal %; /prompt %*

;; Initializations for autoheal. lhit = threshold when a heal is cast.
;; %healing indicates whether a try to heal is running and not fully
;; resolved
/set lhit 260
/set healing 0

/def checkheal = /if ((hit <= lhit)&(!healing)) /healme %; /endif

/def healme = \
       /if (!healing) \
           /set healing 1 %; \
           /send cast 'heal' glod %;\
           /send tell glod . %; \
           /def -1 -p2 -F -mglob -t'*You try to tell*' = /set healing 0 %;\
       /endif

While healing is 1 no more heal-spells will be launched. Directly after
the casting I send an auto-tell, which produces in my mud the output
'You try to tell yourself something'. The client can trigger on that text
and can unset healing again. If you dont use that trigger timing you get
the problem that the client would normally launch several heal actions,
especially when fight lagged through special actions, for example a kick.

Hope that helps,
Hendrik Haese

Hi, well, i want to set up trigger that does this.
I stand in a room an a player arrives, he drops a corpse or 
some corpses or decayed remains of corpses, i add a variable 'giver'
and count the corpses in a variable 'giver_corpse', while i drain
the souls out of the corpses.

Oki if there would be only one player who drops corpses i had no problem:
/set giver 0
/set corpses 0
/def -mregexp -t'^(.*) drops (.*)Corpse(|s) of' = /set giver %P1%;\
       wdrain corpse
/def statgiver = /eval /echo GIVER: %{giver} --- corpses: %{corpses}
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'Grinning eagerly you drain the corpse transfering some' =\
       /set corpses=$[%{corpses}+1]%;wdrain corpse%;

Problem:
  But if 2 or more people drop corpses i need for every player variables
  'giver' and 'corpses'

btw. when a player drops corpses or decayed remains of corpses it looks like:

Donquixote drops Eight Corpses of Orc.   or
Donquixote drops Corpse of Shaman, Three Corpses of Bug and Corpse of Troll.
Donquixote drops The somewhat decayed remains of Magpie, Two Corpses of Crow,

when i drain a corpse with 'wdrain corpse' it says:

Your grimoire starts glowing with crimson light!
Grinning eagerly you drain the corpse transfering some of the
cows soul essence to your grimoire.
Corpse of cow turns to dust.
Your draining is so perfect that you doubt if any essence of the soul
was lost.

Instead of your /set, use something like:
/test corpses_%{who} := corpses_%{who} + 1

Or:
/test giver_%{who} := {P1}

Or if you want them indexed by numbers use that instead of who.  You
need to assign `who' or just sub in the right variable.  In more recent
tfs you can use the ++ operator instead of adding 1.

Open Letter to All Users,

	After nearly 5 years of offering free public services to the 
Internet community, and over a year of experimenting with the "User 
Supported" model, I have found that I can no longer afford to offer free 
public services, either financially or personally.  I have found myself 
forced to the conclusion that the best choice for my own well being is to 
discontinue offering free public services on the Internet.  This is by no 
means an easy decision to make.  My experiences have been very 
fullfilling at times, and I know that many have enjoyed these services.  
There are just too many demands at this time to adequately serve the 
numbers and requirements of the new Internet.

	It is thus with many reservations that I announce that effective 
May 22, 1997, tcp.com and all of its virtual domains and services will be 
discontinued.  Please make whatever arrangements are necessary before 
then to make other arrangements for the services you need.

James Lick


Please forward this to anyone else who may want to know.

Sounds like everything at tcp.com is going away.

Ken: do you have an alternate site to host the list on? I _may_ be able to
dig up a site for it if necessary.

I _am_ able to host a few documents and programs and the mailing list
(as long as my university allows this). If somebody who pays for his
internet access will do this - that's the better choice.

tf still can be found in ftp://ftp.minet.uni-jena.de/pub/tf/

Just confirmed. Ken, if you need a site for the list and file space for
FTP serving of releases, let me know, and we can set it up.

Details: commercial Canadian ISP, currently a 2Mbps link to the net, which
may be upgrading soon. Majordomo as the list software, qmail as the
backend mail software, Linux 2.0.29 as the host OS. The list and the files
won't be displaced; it'll be a stable home for them. No charges for the
list/file space.

Let me know if you're interested, and we can get it set up for you.

I think it is only the list that needs a new space, not the distribution of
tf. Right now that's at "tf.tcp.com" but that's not actually on tcp; it's
really at laurel.actlab.utexas.edu so that won't change.

This is a followup to the "Open Letter" from last week.  I have been 
persuaded financially and otherwise to continue at least parts of 
tcp.com.  While I have not yet decided what to keep, and what not to, I 
thought I would make a new announcement so that everyone will have some 
idea what is going on.  Over the next week or so, I will be looking at 
each individual service and user and assigning a cost and comparing this 
to past level of support by users of the service.  Cost will not be only 
financial, but also adminstrative.  It is likely that some services such 
as mailing lists will be continued only if one or more people volunteer 
to do the support work for the service.  I would like to reduce not only 
my out of pocket expenses but also the amount of time needed for ongoing 
maintenance.  This announcement is not specific because I need to collect 
more data before I make decisions.  There is also the possibility that 
some services may be continued if one or more people pay a set cost per 
month which will cover the costs of that service.  I will make further 
announcements individually as each decision is made and will publish a 
web page to give an overview of all decisions.

Greetings...

I have no idea who I would do this, but what I'm ultimately looking for is
a way in which I can sent something to all my connected worlds of a
particular type.  Such as I have -T'tiny.mush' set for all my tinymushes,
and I would like to be able to do a WHO for all of them, and for all my
Moos, which I have set as -T'tiny.moo' I can do a @who.

Now, I thought I would try and gradually work my way up to it, by first
trying to spit out the names of all the worlds I'm connected to, by doing
this:
	/while $(/listsockets -s) \
	say %1%; \
	/shift%; \
	/done

But it didn't work.  Any ideas how I can get this alone to work?
Any ideas on how I can do the above idea?  Any and all help will be
appreicated.

If all you want to do is send a command to every connected world, you can
just use /send. Here's a command I use to quit from all worlds normally
without them thinking I went linkdead.

/def q=/send -W QUIT%; /quit

And for anyone that wants to do something similar, I set this as my
adisconnect, so whenever I don't quit with QUIT, it gives the message.

@adisconnect me=@swi %0={netdeath},{:has gone linkdead.}

As for sending to all worlds of a certain _type_, maybe that's something
that can be added to tinyfugue for /send.

Here's one possible solution... although sloppy, is workable. I got tired
of typing WHO in all caps for TinyTIM, so i made an alias for that world
so i only need lower case who now. You could make an alias for each world
to catch a command sent by yourself, such as who, and then in each alias
expand it to it's proper needed command (WHO, @who, or what have you) and
send it.

/def -ag -wTim -h"SEND {who}*" alias_who=/send -wTim WHO %-1

the problem is not sending to all worlds at once, but all worlds of a
certain type. the main problems in accomplishing this are:

1) /send doesn't have a -T option and
2) You can't get world type or other info from any world except the current
one. (unless you want to parse /listworlds, but that gets ugly)

On most server types, sending OUTPUTPREFIX by itself shouldn't do anything
harmful. and is silent, So see if this will work:

/def -T'tiny.mush' -h'send OUTPUTPREFIX' sendwho = who%; /send -W
OUTPUTPREFIX%; /undef sendwho

you could also add another /def to send @who or whatever else.
I tried it with just /send -W by itself and hooking send {}, but that just
doesn't want to work. Ah well.

hi
hmmmm.  I posted this to the list some time ago and got no response..  Im 
not sure if it made it to the list so I will post it again.
I need to know how to save aliases to a macro file.  when I make the aliases 
then type /save <filename.tf> and then quit out of of tf and relog back in, 
the aliases are gone..anyone have a clue what Im doing wrong???  If there is 
a different way to save aliases I would appreciate anyone letting me know..
thanks

Well, I didn't see you say this, so I will assume you aren't doing it.
You have to type /load <filename.tf> to get the macros.

Put:
  /load <filename.tf>

inside your .tfrc file, so that each time you start TF, that files is
automagically re-read back into memory

First of all, what do you mean by aliases?  Do you mean /def macros?
If so, you should be able to get what you want with /savedef <filename.tf>.

I'm quite familiar with /send -W.  Now, the thing I want is...sure you can
send the message to all the worlds, but I only want certain worlds to
actually pass it on to the Server.  I don't want to send a WHO or a QUIT
or whatever to anything other than worlds of a particular 'type'.

Also, this isn't just about the WHO/who/@who situation either.  Once I'm
able to send to all my connected worlds of a particular type, then I can
start doing some pretty funky things.  Which is what I'm ultimately hoping
to achieve. 

Nor can I create commands that will send the command to the worlds named:
Cajun_Nights...FrostFire & PernMush.  Because I usually have anywhere to
10 to 20 worlds connected and active, and only a core number of worlds
I'm always connected to, the others are usually rare and occational.

I also collect a list of active mushes.  Especially the ones that aren't
on the mushlists on the web like Mud Connector.  I like to keep a list of
non-public mushes around.  Just so you know.

I have a question SORTA related to this one.  I am connected to 3 or 4
worlds at once, and they all have their own sets of macros.  Problem is,
when I connect to a new world, that new macro file overwrites the old
macrofile.  I know that I can autoload the macro file when I first
connect, is there a way that I can autoload when I /fg a world?
Example: I am connect to Deaths Domain and Kingdoms Divided.  DD is
foreground, KD is background.  When I /fg KD, I want the macro file
ddomicron to purge and kdomicron to load.  IS this possible without large
amounts of coding and Unix work?  BTW, I am using 3.5 B4
Thanks

/def -h'world kd' kdload = /load kdomicron
/def -h'world dd' ddload = /load ddomicron

I don't think you can unload them, but if one overwrites the other as you
just mentioned it should work ok...

I think the easiest way to do it is to have /undef's at the beginning
of each file to remove all the old macros, then move onto the /def's.

As long as all the macros are named (always worth doing anyway), and are
all defined in each file, you don't need to /undef them first, and tf
will override them. But, especially if you change worlds often, this is
going to be fairly slow to load them all each time.

Instead, I would suggest something along the lines of the following. Of
course, this may not be suitable for your situation, in which case just
ignore me! In particular, I haven't mentioned variables which are
world-specific.

1. Name all the macros uniquely, probably as <macro-name>_<world-name>.
2. For all macros with triggers, you can simply define them with the
   -w<world-name> switch, and all will be hoopy.
3. Any other macros -- or macros with triggers which you also want to
   call -- you'll have to write a wrapper, along the (untested :) lines
   of
	/def foo = /eval /foo_${world_name} %*
   which will call the correct macro for the world you are currently in,
   assuming you've named your macros as in step 1.

HTH,

&E

I didn't quite follow the discussion completely lately.
But I recall reading about somebody wanting to send a text
to all lp-worlds.

There is a (not so hard) way to do this:

/require grep.tf

/def selectname = /echo %{L3}
/def listlp = /quote -S /selectname `/grep lp /listsockets
/def sendlp = /quote -S /send -w`"/listlp" %{*}

The first macro will select the name field (third-last) from /listsockets.
The second macro will list all worlds of 'lp'-type.
And the last macro will send a text to all worlds listed with /listlp.

So now you can send a text to all lpworlds with just:
/sendlp <the text to send>

Note: it assumes that "lp" will only appear in the type field of
/listsockets.
If you use hostnames or worlds like "help", the above may not work.
In this case, replace the grep in the second macro by something more
intelligent; e.g. /egrep [^a-z]lp /listsockets

Woohoo! :-)

Is this arrangement semi-permanent, or is it a temporary thing?

Howdy,
Nope, the login-procedure is handeled by the remote server. There is on
most muds a command that allow wizards to shield there presents from the
rest of the mud.

 Someone help me out on this one, I'm getting frustrated.. :)

 What I want to do is trigger two lines of text. Or relly the last words
of one line, and the beginning of the following line.. Like this:

Ugadaga mutters the magic words 'ugga buggaa bogga'
You feel an aura covering your body.

 This is to trigger a response like --> "say Aura Up!"

 I've tried the following:

/def -p1 -F -mregexp -t'ugga buggaa bogga\'$^You feel an aura' = \
say Aura Up!

 ..and it doesn't trig the trigger.. So what am I doing wrong? :)

Always name your triggers.  That said, tf doesn't directly match pairs
of lines.  Make a second trigger to match after you've seen the first.

/def -p1 -F -mregexp -t'ugga buggaa bogga\'$' bogga =\
    /def -p101 -F -mregexp -t'^You feel an aura' bogga_aura =\
	say Aura Up!%;\
    /def -p100 -1 -F -t'*' bogga_miss =\
	/undef bogga_aura


This version will make a trigger, and if you don't see the aura line
kill that second trigger.  You may need to adjust priorities to your
personal trigger environment.

any line is handled separate of TF. You can't match two lines in ONE
trigger.
what you could do, is to set up a trigger which defines another trigger
(which hopefully then matches the next line)

like:

/def -p1 -F -mregexp -t'ugga buggaa bogga' =\
  /def -p1 -F -mregexp -t'^You feel an aura' xxx = \
    /send say Aura Up!%%;\
    /undef xxx

There is still one disadvantage here: you don't ONLY match the phrase in
two lines, but also if there is some other text between (which may couse
problems sometimes)

Anyway, this should faily work and you probably want to optimize this
on your own.

  Uwe

Is there a limit to the number of worlds TinyFugue can take?
Personally, I have done around 50 worlds simoultaneously, and have had
no problems with that.  Could it possible manage 100, or more?

Older systems tended to stop at 64 open files, each socket counts as a
file, as well as your input/output, and random extra.  Many newer
systems have larger limits with dynamic allocation.  Often you can tell
with the `limit' and `limit -h' commands.

Here's a fun trick[1]: /for i 1 200 /world name port
where name and port are for your favourite tinymud.  then use /send -W
to send a connect string to all of them.  Your presence in the WHO list
will win you fans.

There is a way to solve the multiple line trigs problem. If I find 
some time later today, I may write the lib version of the solution.

The idea is using states, the same way many regexp pattern matching 
programs, such as lex, mailagent and, I think, awk do. This could 
probably be added to TF source code without much trouble, but I don't 
think, nor do I expect, to see this feature added before 3.5 release.

The syntax would be something like:

/def -t'first line' name = /state 2
/def -t'second line' -s 2 name2 = /state 3
/def -t'third line' -s 3 name3 = etc...

Obviously, you should use different states for every multiple line 
pattern.

TinyFugue does not impose any limit; the only limits are those imposed
by the environment.  The unix shell command "ulimit" will tell you and
let you change how many open files are allowed (note that for tf "open
files" includes 3 terminal files, /load, /quote !, /quote ', and logs,
in addition to world connections).

If you're going to go as far as adding it to the lib, you might want to
make it more general, in case people want to have multiple, multiple-line
triggers.  Otherwise, each additional multiple-trigger would make the
number of states insane :)

something along the lines of
/state state_var 5
or something.
Maybe even /state state_var next ? :)

probably several people have various `expect' like libraries for doing
things like this already.  if you're going to write a real library for
this sort of thing, you might want to spend the time up front and plan
out a powerful, good approach so that it can be used by lots of people
in a convienent manner.

Actually, I was expecting a simple comment on the use of /state and 
/teststate to be enough. :-)

I'm not sure if /teststate can be done, though. The idea was for it 
to abort the parent macro, but it seems that can't be done. Ideally, 
it would work like this:

/def -t'line 1' trig1_1 = /teststate 0 %; /newstate 1
/def -t'line 2' trig1_2 = /teststate 1 %; /newstate 2
/def -t'line 3' trig1_3 = /teststate 2 %; /newstate 0 %; things

/def -t'line 1' trig2_1 = /teststate 0 %; /newstate 10
/def -t'line 2' trig2_2 = /teststate 10 %; /newstate 11
/def -t'line 3' trig2_3 = /teststate 11 %; /newstate 0 %; things

There are two obvious problemas. The first, this is way too verbose. 
The second, how will /teststate stop the parent macro (the "trig" 
macros)?

I considered reducing all commands to a simple /state command:

/def -t'line 1' trig1_1 = /state 0 1
/def -t'line 2' trig1_2 = /state 1 2
/def -t'line 3' trig1_3 = /state 2 0 %; things

That's way better. But it has the same problem /teststate has, and 
introduces a new problem: it is too cryptic. :-) Well, it *looks* 
cryptic to me. :-)

The problem would be better solved, but reducing the flexibility (the 
ability to use states for other purpuses) by writting a wrapper macro:

/mtrig -t'line 1' trig1
/mtrig -t'line 2' trig1
/mtrig -t'line 3' trig1 = things

In this case, the /mtrig would write the appropriate state-aware 
macros, and would take care with multiple triggers. The problem here 
is that you won't be able to do actions at each trigger line. The 
solution:

/mtrig -t'line 1' trig1 = things
/mtrig -t'line 2' trig1 = things
/emtrig -t'line 3' trig1 = things

In either case, the macros names would not be "trig1". So, the user 
would have a *lot* of trouble trying to undefine or redefine it.

The last problem is... that I'm not sure how I'll proceed if the 
later lines *are not* triggered. Sigh...

Just give people /mundef, etc.  For similar approach in use by many
people w/o any undef & redef complaints, you might want to look at the
tdef package:

I've heard that sometimes older versions of lynx mis-download the actual 
source code by sticking a blank line in the middle of the file.

Thanks for all of your help in advance:
if someone sends me a message like this:

(14,p Name) Are you there?

Note that the number "14" and "Name" and the person's message is subject
to change.  The only things that is NOT subject to change is: ",p" and the
"( )".

When the message comes to me as above, I would like to send this: 

.p14 Hello, Name...I am not here




Can someone help me?

Hi, maybe someone of you can help me with my problem...
I don't want to see hooks messages like "% Loading commands from ..."
and use "/def -ag -h<hook> hookname" to gag them out. But I'm
not able to find the right name of the hook to gag the save-message
"% Writing macros to ...". I don't know, if I'm just not able to find the
right hook, or if the right hook simply doesn't exist.

I don't think it has one, according to /help hooks. But you might be able
to use fwrite() to make a silent saver.

I have a question regarding connecting to different worlds..
On one account, it is set up to where when you try to connect to a world 
that is down, it keeps trying to connect in the background while lietting 
you do things in the foreground..  but on my other account, it attempts to 
connect to a world while in the foreground not letting me do other things..  
is there a way to change this?  if this is unclear, just let me know and I 
will try to explain better..
Thanks for your time.

that has to do whether your %connect and %gethostbyname are set to
"blocking" or "nonblocking". nonblocking will setup another process and let
you do stuff while it's connecting, while blocking will freeze you up.

Hello !

I have still got the problem around the trigger if the line from mud looks
out like next :

*an Orc* has arrived from the west riding on hungry warg.

or  text coming from mud might been look like : 

*Payername the Elf* is standing here.

ther i need first create a trigger for autoflee, if the person starts doing
a magic spell.

Output from mud looks then :

*an Orc* begins some strange incrantations ...

now i would execute the trigger what will cause me to flee ... 

Ken Keys suggested me for like :

/def -mglob -t"\\\\*an Orc\\\\* begins some strange"=flee%;exits

the probelem is that the thing still didnt works. I have tryed to get the
thing from left to right right to left added "\" and removed them .. 
Seems like nothing happens.

Could someone maybe help ?

I'm sure this is an easy one, but I haven't found it yet...

For something I'm doing, I'd like TinyFugue to be quiet; basically, any
output that tf itself would display, I'd like to be able to selectively
gag. Is there a simple way of doing this (basically, a mode to shut off
internal output by TF)? If not, would it be easily added in a future
release?

try help hooks. You can see most of tf's internal output like that. Then
you can /def -ag -h'hookname'. And yes, you should name your macro too.

wouldn't you need a * at the end for a glob?
maybe a regexp would be better. try
-t"\*[^\*]+\* begins some strange'"

 If this doesn't work I'd suggest using -mregexp, I personnally like it
more.. ;) And does it necessarily have to be "*an Orc*"? I mean don't you
want to flee from everyone that starts casting a spell.. So the following
would work..:

 /def -mglob -t'*begins some strange*' autoflee = flee%;exits

(Also I think I know why that earlier trigger doesn't work.. You need to
have a * at the end of the trigtext when using -mglob if it isn't the
whole line..)

The newer systems seem to handle 65 worlds/connections/files fine. :)

Horse 2: The Stayer -JWAJ (John Pine)
His legendary performances at Palmer Oval have cemented his reputation as
the stayer in the race. This frisky young cult has a way with the fillies
from different paddocks, and hence must neigh loud for long periods to
communicate with them. When he wins his next race he will be encouraged to
buy his own phone. But his friskiness is not just wasted on the fillies.
Always eager to help out at the stables he easily shovels the manure that
horses from low lands dish out. Look out for this young cult who is
bursting with enthusiasm and kindness, because he is on the way up,
passing all those lazy mules from different paddocks.

from different paddocks, and hence must neigh loud for long periods to
communicate with them. When he wins his next race he will be encouraged to
buy his own phone. But his friskiness is not just wasted on the fillies.
Always eager to help out at the stables he easily shovels the manure that
horses from low lands dish out. Look out for this young cult who is
bursting with enthusiasm and kindness, because he is on the way up,
passing all those lazy mules from different paddocks.
This is taken from Discordia Mush

That's probably the maximum size of a file.  Read the docs for ulimit
and use the right arguments.  (I didn't give them because they vary by
platform and shell; in bash, it's "ulimit -n".)

Can anyone explain why the first line of code works fine (the echo will
evaluate and return "foo") but the second line does not?

The \] seems to make all the difference.  \) and other chars do work fine.


/test regmatch("\[(.+)\]", "[foo]") & echo(P1)

/test regmatch("\[([^\]]+)\]", "[foo]") & echo(P1)


thanks,

35) Mer'rark  Yesterday -- TinyFugueVMS
From: Mer'rark  10:32:13 05/20/97 CDT
  
   Having had the executable in my posession for a few years now, I 
finnally found the site where the source code was stored, namely 
ftp://drycas.club.cc.cmu.edu/pagan/tf.  There, was the source for TF-VMS 
version 1.0 beta 3, the same version I'd used when a friend of a friend 
(whom I can't remember now) put it on the VMS account I was using at the 
time.  It was antiquated even for back then, and I thought it was a real 
old version but I just found out it had been released in October of 
1993, and was based on TF for Unix version 2.0 beta 6, and as far as I 
can tell there have been no subsequent versions.
 
   If anyone out there wants to take a stab at updating this thing, by 
all means do.  I don't have real access to a VMS account anymore but I 
do know a few people that do, and they might appreciate a more updated 
version.  Thanks.  :)
  
Done.

When you want to in/exclude a litteral ']', you must put it in as
the first character. Any '\' will be seen as a litteral '\' character
(it has no special meaning at this place).

So the second line should read:

/test regmatch("\[([^]]+)\]", "[foo]") & echo(P1)

If you want to exclude any more characters, put them _after_
the '^]'.

Assuming you're on a unix box, you can use 'at' or 'cron' to run 
"tf <your world>" whenever you want, -or- assuming that you're running tf
all the time, and you get disconnected occasionally (game reboot or
whatever), then you could use a /repeat ...

Well, if you are running TF all the time, you can /require at.tf and use
that as well.

Okay i have been lookin all over the place for some info about the tick.tf 
utility in tinyfugue. How does this tick counter work? I type /load ticit loads it. Then i type /tick ANYTHINGHERE and it says "%Tick counter is not running." Could someone please explain the tick timer to me?

Well...

/tick, to see where the counter's at presently.
/tickon, to activate it.
/tickoff, to deactivate it.
/tickset, to reset the counter.
/ticksize <number> to set the counter at the number of seconds you want it
to be at. :)

Else, well, try /load tick.tf, to see where the file tick.tf is, and then,
well, read the file to have more info. ;)

Oh, while I'm here, ummm, is there a way to have tf echo me the current
time like, at every hour?  Or maybe, when a certain string shows up on the
screen, that an echo is made on screen of the time the message got
received?

I can do you one better.  I have the latest in-development source that I
left off on awhile ago.  If anyone wants to work on updating this or even
taking over, drop me an email.  I'll help you out as best as I can.

Fairly soon now I'm leaving Uni (hopefully with a degree ... ;), and so
I'll lose the opportunity to have my machine connected and hosting the
webpages, which include my tf beginners' guide. I don't yet know where
they will end up, but I have managed to find a way of making my POBoxes
account forward WWW lookups as well. So, from now on, my TinyFugue
Beginners' Guide can be found at the following URL:
	http://www.poboxes.com/andy.mortimer/tfguide.htm
(with a natty DOS-like URL, so I can move around later ):.

On a related note, since I will have to pay by the minute for my net
access from now on, the chances are that I won't be using TinyFugue for
much longer after the end of term. So if anybody wants to take over the
beginners' guide, do get in touch.

Cheers,

&E

Does anyone know where binaries for Solaris 2.x can be found?  I did find
one site that the home page said they had them but they weren't actually

How about

/def -mregexp -t'^\[([A-z)+) has connected\]$' test = \
    /let temp=%{P1} %;\                    <--- if let does not work, try set
    /if (temp =~ "Johnnie") \
        <commands for Johnnie> %;\
    /elseif (temp =~ "Pooh") \
        <commands for Pooh> %;\
    /elseif (temp =~ "Foo") \
        <commands for Foo> %;\
    /else
        <commands for the rest of the world> %;\
    /endif
?

I use analogue triggers, and they work fine.

Here is what I do:
Whenever I define an alias which I want to keep, I execute the command
"/writealias <alias name>", which is definde as

/def writealias = \
    /log -l <name of my world's tf commands> %;\
    /alias %0 %;\
    /log -l off

The command "/writealias" would log all definde aliases to the file 
(which, in the simplest case, is just your .tfrc file).

Perhaps this helps although my answer is late ...

	I'm trying to use /Grab in a prety interesting way.  I have a 
command called /take, which when I use like /take me foo, I 'Grab' the 
contents of the attribute in foo on me.  I think the actuall code is 
something like;
	/def -qi TAKE = Think > TinyFugueEdit > &%1 [Get(%1/%2)]
	/def -qi -t'> TinyFugueEdit > &*' = /Grab %-3

	My problem is, when I try and use /take now, must of the time I 
have to try a few times before the /grab actually 'catches'.  And worse 
yet, because of the think (which is like a @Pemit Me, for those not 
familiuar with MUSH style commands) will repeat the command once, and the 
Grab repeats it again, so my screen gets spammed big time if I try this 
command on some large attribute.

	Thecommand is great though, for people, like me, whom are 
continueally updating their previous code.  A quick /take and that 
paragraph line attribute that you wrote three months ago, is right at 
your fingertips.

	But I don't think I've been clear in what I'm asking.  Basicly, 
I'm looking for a better mousetrap.  Like I've said, sometimes I have to 
run the command (/take) a few times to actually get it to click, and then 
when it does click The /Grab and the Th spam the screen.

	Help. :}

I have something just like this -- the grabbing macro is set -ag to gag 
the text, and only grab it, thus preventing the spam.  I have never had 
to repeat it.

My /take is actually coded into the MUX I go on, as 'ed'.  The grabber:

/def -i -p100 -ag -t'FugueEdit > *' FugueEdit = /grab %-2

The macros:

edit1: $ed */*:setq(0,[switch(%0,me,%#,here,%l,[locate(%#,%0,*)])]);@set/quiet
me=vn:%q0;@set/quiet me=vr:%1;@pemit %#=FugueEdit > &%1 %q0=[get(%q0/%1)]
edit2: $ed *:@switch %0=*/*,,{@vr me=%0;@pemit %#=FugueEdit > &%0
%vn=[get(%vn/%0)]}
edit3: $ed:@pemit %#=FugueEdit > &%vr %vn=[get(%vn/%vr)]
edit4: $ng *:setq(0,[switch(%0,me,%#,here,%l,[locate(%#,%0,*)])]);@pemit
%#=FugueEdit > @name %q0=[fullname(%q0)]

These may require some adjusting for MUSH.  Basically, "ed obj/attr" will 
edit the attribute on the object.  "ed attr" will edit the attribute on 
the last object used in the editor.  "ed" will edit the last attribute 
edited.  "ng obj" will edit the object's name.

The output with ed me/testattr:

FugueEdit > &testattr #9527=This is the attribute's contents.

Hope this helps.  As I said, I've never needed to repeat this -- it 
catches every time.

One thing all of you who are using code like this might want to consider 
is softcoding a switch to check that the enactor is you and not someone 
else @pemitting things to you (like /sh rm -i *.* or something) and 
having it accidentally stuck in your typing buffer (and perhaps 
accidentally executed if you don't look before you hit return.)

Yes, this could be a problem.  I've been planning to recode it myself,
since that code is someone else's I parented from.  A better solution is
what it -said- it did, which is to have a password settable by the user,
but it wasn't coded to support that for some reason.

I recently 'fixed' this so it's far less likely someone can @pemit
something nasty to me and have it /grabbed. It involves tinyfugue
picking a randon number and then comparing it once it gets the
gag/trigger against what it picked.

I won't send the gory details to the whole list, but if you're
interested email me (infynity@cyberhighway.net, if my headers got
hashed) and I'll email it back to you in an attachment or whatever
form you wish that I can manage.

	What I was originally looking for was a way to eliminate the 
@PEmit in the first place.  The way I have things now, I don't need to 
write macro's on each and every one of my (many) MUSH list.  Instead, I 
have them all as macros on TF, so I only have to write them down once.  
Problem is, to trigger the /def -t'TinyFugue'=/grab, I have to Think 
(@Pemit Me) the attribute to myself.  And this, basicly, causes alot of 
spam I was hoping someone out there could tell me (or better yet, show 
me; better yet, explain to me) how to avoid.

 Hello all tf-guru's out there! :)

 I could probably do this myself, but I'm too lazy and have too little
time to actually do something about it, therefore I let you do the work
for me.. ;)

 What I'm looking for is an automatic mapper. Something that will record
my movements into a file, and create a map of the output. The map could be
in any format, ASCII/ANSI/whatever, just as long as it's
readable/understandable.

 The mapper would have to not be based on what I write, but rather on the
input "<pleader> leaves <direction>", where <leader> is a predefined
player name (e.g. /set pleader=Guruman)

 I could probably get this done myself as far as getting the output of
<direction> saved to a file, but that's as far as my talents as a
programmer goes.. :)

 If anyone has the time/will/etc. to look into my problem, I'd be happy
for any answers. Thanks in advance.

 - Pude

 I do that all the time, but /log doesn't really draw any maps, does it?
;) What I want is something that spares me the effort of later sitting
with paper and pencil and drawing the map from the movements in my log..

 Great, this is just what I was looking for.. Now I'll just have to make
something that breaks the map in two when going places like

/Def the grabber trigger with -ag to gag it - that nukes the spam.

Hi there,

I am just trying to pretty up my world output and while doing this,
I ran into a few things which mess me up. I have messages like

HP:[360/360|100%|0] SP:[510(98)/492] NP:[655/655] E:[unknown]

and want now the first numbers in the [] to be BOLD or UNDERLINED!

HP:[360/360|100%|0] SP:[510(98)/492] NP:[655/655] E:[unknown]
    ***                 ***              ***

Ok, so far I have a trigger to match those line (since I triggered
some actions on it before, which worked pretty well), but if I match
those line now, how do i get it highlighted?

I use the following trigger:

/def -w<worldname> -F -p1 -i -mregexp 
     -t'HP\:\[([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)\]
SP\:\[([0-9]+)(\(([0-9]+)\))?/([0-9]+)\] NP\:\[([0-9]+)/([0-9]+)\] ' 
     macroname = ....

Now %P1, %P3 and %P7 are keeping the strings I want to highlight.

I think I now have to gag the whole line (therefore I add a -g to the
define) 
and print/echo it to my output. This gets me to the question:
How can I /echo without linefeed?
I think the only way to echo bold text is /echo -ah, but then a
linefeed is added and my output would contain 5 lines.

Are there other ways to partially highlight/underline/color a line?
Do I really need to gag?
And even if not needed here, how do I /echo without a linefeed?

Some questions which shouldn't be too tough for the experienced TF'ler
out there.
Thanx in advance,
  Uwe

	Actually it doesn't, for some odd reason.  I still get the output 
twice.  Is there a way to put the whole thing into the keyboard buffer, 
perhaps?

	Something else I noticed, that if you /take something with two 
lines in it, like;

VA [#1] LA
FOOF

	TF will only '/take' the first line.  Sorta screwy.

I got tired of writing /eval command%;command2%;command3, so i wrote my
own eval parser using commas (only one char vs 3)....

/set temp_str=""
/alias ] /do_expand %{*}
/def do_expand = \
        /set temp_str %{*} %;\
        /while ( $[strchr(temp_str,",")] > -1 ) \
                /set prev $[substr(temp_str, 0, $[strchr(temp_str,",")])]%;\
                /set rest $[substr(temp_str, $[strchr(temp_str,",")+1])]%;\
                /set temp_str $[strcat(prev,"%;",rest)] %;\
        /done %;\
        /eval %{temp_str}


Is this the most efficient way to do this? or is there some way to change
the builtin delimeter in tf? (nothing in /help suggests you can).

Is there any way to have tf read all my input and if it has a new delimeter
character /eval the line after changing the new delimeters to %;'s? e.g I
type in 'command;command2;command3' tf would parse that into
/eval command%;command2%;command3 based solely on the fact it had ';' in it?

(yes i realize this may cause problems in tells and such, I'm willing to
deal with that if there is any way to do it....any ideas?)

thanks,
	Andrew

If that's a unterminated line (prompt), there's nothing you can do.  But
if that's normal newline-terminated text, you can define a "partial" hilite
for each part you want hilited (a single partial hilite can only hilite
one part).

/def -F -P1Bu -t'HP:\\[([0-9]+)/' hilite_hp
/def -F -P1Bu -t'SP:\\[([0-9]+)/' hilite_sp
/def -F -P1Bu -t'NP:\\[([0-9]+)/' hilite_np

This is generally a bad idea.  In older versions, it was the only way to
do certain tricks, but it can cause problems, and there is almost always
a better way to do it now.

> And even if not needed here, how do I /echo without a linefeed?

You can't.  (But you can /prompt.)

I don't know where you learned to count, but "%;" looks like 2 characters
to me. :)

Well, your loop could store the result of strchr() in a variable instead
of calling it 3 times, and there's no need for both temp_str and rest;
but to answer your real question, no, there's no way to change the command
terminator.

If you're just trying to save typing on the command line, an alternative
solution is:
  /def -b; semicolon = /input %%;

Well, just add the flags for highlight!

Hello, everyone...

I've been trying to get highlighting of names of people that I regularly
converse with working properly, and have run into a little snag. I'm
currently using:

/def -PCcyan -t'[nN]ameofuser'

as a template to match the name of a particular user and highlight it.
However, the problem here is that if another match from another definition
appears on the same line, only one of the highlights wins.

Is there a recommended way to do what I'm doing here? Another point (ok,
I'm bad on regular expressions) I wanted to try and do is match any casing
of their name without having to do something messy like [aA] on every
letter in the name. Is there an easy way to do this?

Thanks in advance for helping me with a rather simple problem.

Thats true, because if you don't define a trigger priority, (try /help
proiroty)
this triggers get the default priority, which is the same for any of
them.
(I guess it's -p1, not quite sure, check it with /list -P)
Like written in /help priority only one non-fall-through-trigger
(choosen by random)
is executed for one priority.If you want more of them to be checked, use
-F in the
definition (Fall-thru macros are defined with /def -F.)

No possibility I know of, at least none which is more simple than doing
the [aA] thing.

Hi
I have a couple of questions that need answering...
First, is there a way to gag the messages that tf is loading the files that 
I have it load when I connect to a world?
And esecond is there a way to force worlds to not load their macro files?
Thanks lots for any answers that anyone might have for me.

 Hello again TF-guru's!

 How do I save a string to a file without overwriting the existing file
but instead adding to the end of it?

I have another question, sorry tobother you all..
How do you mix -l and -q when connecting to a world?
What I mean is, I want to disable autologin but I also want to enable -q at 
the same time..  this is what I have tried..  I have also read the help 
files on /world /connect and tf
I have tried tf -l -q <world>
tf -lq <world>
and tf [-lq] <world>
none of these worked.  could someone tell me what Im doing wrong or is it 
possible to mix those options together?
thanks.
Cary

   I don't think it's possible, since -q keeps the login screen from
appearing, -l expects you to login.  You might try /addworld'ing a test
world with no name or password in the /addworld, then try /world -q
<worldname>.  It would achieve the same effect, if it worked. Another
possibility is /set autologin off?  Not sure on that, but I think I
remember seeing an 'autolog' or 'autologin' variable at one point.  If you
can turn that off, then /world -q <world>, or /set quiet on. *shrug*

hello,
	Could someone either explain or tell me where I can find a detailed explanation of how % expansion works?  for example:
Does
/echo %variable_one%;
expand before
/echo %variable_two%%;
or am I totally missing the point??

Thanks

	Something somebody said here prompted a little project for me. 
Unfortunatly I can't seem to find a way to make it work.

	What I want to do create a way to keep track of my experience on 
a mud. What I am trying to do is write XP that I have recieved for 
killing a mob to a file. I already have a way to extract the XP from the 
output of the world. My problems are as follows:

        0> fwrite() only appends to a file. I'd like to overwrite it if 
             possible. If not, I'll suffer thru.

        1> If overwriting isn't possible, I'll need a way to read just 
             the *last* line of a file.

        2> I can't seem to find a fread() function anywhere.

	Suggestions? Idea? Help?

how about doing something like:
/def savedxp = %xp
(or whatever variable name you're using)
then /save that one macro.
then, you can use $(/savedxp) when you load it back in next time.

there's always the hack that I first used with saving stuff to files ...
/sh echo "stuff" > filename       or

careful with shell expansion & whatnot.

Didn't understand your example, lemme try to explain it with a lil macro
of my own:

/def track = \
    /if /ismacro doTrack%; /then \
        /echo -e %%% Autotracking disabled.%;\
        /undef doTrack%;\
    /else  \
        /echo -e %%% Autotracking enabled.%;\
        /def -mregexp -t"^You see your quarry's trail head \
        (east|west|north|south|down|up) from here!" doTrack = %%{P1} %;\
    /endif

And look at the two % signs on the last line, the doTrack macro is
nested within the track macro, so if you use %{P1} in stead of %%{P1},
and you call the track macro, it wants to fill in the value for %{P1}
while defining the doTrack macro. In this case, the %{P1} doesn't exist,
so the def inside the def would define the macro w/o the %{P1}.

If you call the track macro the way it's defined here, and type /list
doTrack, you see something like this:

% 294: /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^You see your quarry\'s trail head 
(east|west|north|south|down|up) from here!' doTrack = %{P1}

Regularly, you'll have to add an extra % sign for every level you nest a
macro in another macro. It is necessary for global variables as well,
I'm rewriting this track stuff now, and it uses a global variable: (It's
an incomplete macro, but usable as an example)

/def trackTest = \
    /def -mregexp -t"^You see your quarry's trail head \
        (east|west|north|south|down|up) from here!" doTrack = %%{P1} %;\
    /def -t"You suddenly lose track of your quarry!" targetDead = \
        /echo %%% Aaaargh! Your track target is dead!%;\
    /def -t"You have lost your quarry's trail!!" trackAgain = \
        track %%trackTarget% %;\

Again, on the last line, you see the two % signs in %%trackTarget%. And
again, if I would write only one % sign there, it would fill in the
value for %trackTarget% in stead of defining the macro with the name of
the variable in it.

The echos in the nested macros echo only 2 % signs in stead of 3 for
similar reasons, can't really explain those though ;P

> /sh echo "stuff" > filename

	This worked, but had the annoying habit of flickering the screen 
as it exited TF and came back after executing the command. But It did 
give me a good idea.

/def -mregexp -t'You receive [0-9].* experience points.' xp_counter=\
	/quote /set savedexp=!cat ~/${world_name}/$[playername]%;\
	/set savedexp=$[savedexp+%3]%;\
	/quote !echo $[savedexp] > ~/${world_name}/$[playername]

	That's what I have ended up with. Works great and I'd like to 
thank those of you that assisted me. If anyone has suggestions to improve 
this, please let me know. Better==good

	Now, on to the next step. :) 

	I need to compare another file to this one. The 'levels' file 
lists the experience needed to gain each level. The 'exp' file if the one 
that I have created above, liting my current experience point on the 
given mud.  'levels' looks something like this:

	1	[level 1]
	562	[level 2]
	1500	[level 3]
	3000	[level 4]
	4875	[level 5]
	etc.

	I'd like to compare the 'exp' with each line in 'levels' and 
return (to the screen) the next level (same as the line number) and the 
amount of exp needed to reach it (next level exp - current exp). 

	I considered a /while and a /for loop, but I can't figure out how 
to get the 'levels' file in as the loop increment. I figure I am going to 
have to do another /quote, but I can't figure out how.

	Suggestions?


	Patrick

Hello, everyone,

I'm trying to get a little idea I had going here; basically, what I'd
really like to have when running multiple TinyFugue connections is
something similar to what Linux virtual consoles and 'screen' do;
essentially, restore the screen to a complete, full-screen view of that
world when switching between worlds (i.e. display the current condition of
the screen when you switch to it).

I've basically got this working using /recall, but is there _any_ way I
can eliminate the additional three lines thrown into the output (the "----
World x ----" line, then the header and footer for the /recall)? This
would go hand-in-hand with something I'd asked before, about the ability
to arbitratily gag the normal "internal" output of TinyFugue with an
option (basically, a "quiet mode" operation, preferably a togglable
condition).

Also, what's the easiest way to determine current screen size, so I know
how much to recall?

Alternatively, has anyone else done this in a more interesting/better way?

Use /quote -S to make the body execute inline; otherwise, the body of
the quote won't execute until after xp_counter is done executing, and
your info will be corrupted.

Use ' instead of !cat:
  	/quote /set savedexp='~/${world_name}/$[playername]%;\

You could optionally make the file contain a tf command, so you can /load it
instead of using /quote to read it (unless you want to be able to use this
file outside of tf too).

Use the builtin ${world_character} instead of your calculated playername
(assuming you define a character name with /addworld).

  /def -mregexp -t'You receive ([0-9]+) experience points.' xp_counter=\
      /load ~/${world_name}/${world_character}%;\
      /set savedexp=$[savedexp+%P1]%;\
      /sys echo "/set savedexp=%savedexp" > ~/${world_name}/${world_character}

Technically, that file name you generate could contain shell metacharacters
which would screw you up.  The complete fix for this is to quote the file
name, and escape any quotes within the file name.  Also, /quote uses /bin/sh,
which usually doesn't understand ~, but the tf function filename() does.

    ...
    /let name=$(/escape ' ~/${world_name}/${world_character})%;\
    /sys echo "/set savedexp=%savedexp" > '$[filename(name)]'

You could use a /quote to read the whole thing in to a bunch of variables,
but it's probably easiest to have each /quote body do everything itself:
extract the experience and level numbers, compare experience to
%savedexp, and possibly print the message.

/quote # quotes lines from history; so,
  /quote -S -decho #n
is the same as
  /recall n
only without the headers and footers.

Fantastic, that did exactly what I was after, except for one thing; ANSI
codes have been eliminated from this output, as opposed to calling /recall
directly. Am I missing an argument somewhere that I can't find?

No, /quote only works with the text, not the attributes.

There is also one other minor difference:  /recall's output is not recorded
into any history, but /quote's output is recorded in local history.

Hi.

The command 'return' from "map.tf" doesn't work. Always when I'm trying to
use it I see "Don't know how to return from <DIR>.". I think I do
everything well and it isn't my fault, so I send the part of "map.tf", 
mayby You will be able to help me.

/def -i return = \
        /let dir=$(/last %path)%;\
        /unpath%;\
;       These directions must be listed in complementary pairs.
        /_return_aux n s e w ne sw nw se u d%;

/def -i _return_aux = \
        /if ( {#} == 0 ) \
                /echo -e %% Don't know how to return from "%dir".%;\
                /set path=%path %dir%;\

Has anyone else ever noticed that if you log onto a mud, lp or such that
has a prompt, it does something to that session of tf. What happens is
that once you've logged into the mud, even if you then disconnect, text
that should be appearing in the output window keeps flashing down in the
input window first... sometimes staying there, sometimes vanishing and
then reappearing in the output. It's very annoying and the only way I've
found to fix it is to quit tf and restart it. Is there any way to fix or
avoid this?

	I have also noticed what I would call strange behavior, but
for all I know it could be the design. My lp mud has a 'clear' command
that send the ESC [2J ESC [H sequence, and when I switch worlds
and then switch back is appears to me that Tf dumps the last string
or the esc sequence back to the screen thus shooting my cursor to the
top of the screen and I lose what was on the screen from the previous
world. Im not really all that bothered by it tho, I have gotten use to
just hitting enter twice after I use the 'clear' command, but I thought
I would mention this since it sounds like it may be in relation to what
Fade is seeing also.

	TF apparently now auto-recognises lp/diku/prompt-based muds and turns on /lp
and /lpquote. When you leave a prompt-based world, you can turn off
prompt-handling simply with the command:

/lp off
/lpquote off -- don't bother if you don't make a habit of using the /quote
command.

This is because of a tf workaround for a limitation of LP mud prompts
(see "/help prompts" for details).  If you don't explicitly define a
world as LP, tf will try to automatically detect them and /set lp=on,
but will not turn it off when you leave that world.  The best solution
is to use the -T'lp' option of addworld (see "/help /addworld") to
explicitly define your world types; then tf will turn /set lp=off when
you're on non-lp-prompt worlds.

	An article was posted on the UseNet about a port
of TinyFUGUE for Windows 95. I grabbed the file and have
made it available on my ftp site as well. If anyone wants
it, it can be found at:

	ftp.cc.cc.ca.us /pub/Muds/TinyFUGUE/tf-34a16_Win32.zip

	Version 34a16 is what I found and I have nothing
to do with the port, so I can't be of much help. There is
a file named 'install.txt' in it, 'least I think thats the
name, that explains how to set it up. I have ran this under
WinNT 4.0 (SP2 & SP3) and it works very well. It runs in
a Command shell window and I had no problems with it in an
80x25 on up to 80x50 text screen size (with color's).
	A person on the Intermud channels asked me if there
was a newer version with the Proxy support in it, and as
I said, I had nothing to do with this port and can't be of
any help, sorry, I ditched WinNT at home and now run Linux.
If anyone finds or ports it over I'd be happy to add it to
my ftp archive.

 Can anyone help me out here? I can't find out how to make a trig find the
PID of itself so that it can be killed later.

 What I do is a /repeat -150 1 that should be killed if a certain spell
fall before 150 secs have passed.. Now I've got everything else set up,
except I can't seem to catch the pid of the /repeat so I could kill it
later..

Check the special variable %? after you do the /repeat.  It holds the PID.

I know that the later versions of Tf allow the use of the /ps command.
This will allow to get the process numbers should you wish to kill them
at a later time. /kill <pid#> will allw you to kill the pid that you the
current process that you no longer need or want. I hope that this has been
of some help to you.

Why is it, that on all NUTS based code only, for example, "one" and then "two"
is sent down the socket when I issue the command "/repeat 1 one %; two %; three
%; four" to TinyFugue (latest version), and not "one", "two", "three", and
"four"? It works as expected for other MUDs that I have been on :-/

NUTS code is not infallible, to say the least, and generally quite simple
in handling socket i/o. The effect is that when under moderate+ load (10+
active users) the code will lose data waiting on socket, depending on how
fast the system is (which stipulates how fast the code can get to the data
and stick it in the user's buffer). Users are stored in a linked list
(current versions; older versions used a static array), and the list is
iterated over completely, calling FD_ISSET for write OR read conditions on
the socket after a select() call. 

Problem here is that if we have 10 or so active users, all inputting data
at the same time, and we're multiplexing over the sockets linearly, if you
flood your socket - even a short amount of data sent very quicly - NUTS
grabs whatever data is waiting on the socket at that given moment and
moves on to the next user. All sockets have their mask's FD_ZERO'd AFTER
the entire list of users has been processed, as well as new connections to
the system. 

So what's happening? In between the time it does a call to read() on your
socket and FD_ZERO's your socket mask, more data has come in, but never
gets processed. Bad code design. 

The only way to get around it would be to /ptime 1 and then repeat your
experiment - given an average system loaded with 10+ users, it just isn't
fast enough to get to all your data, so slowing your output will
definitely fix your problem.

Simple problem...probably just a basic unix command, but still.... My
server has tf installed on it....when i login, all i need to do is type tf,
and it loads my .tfrc file, blahblahblah.....works fine.  I just downloaded
a newer version of tf... My problem is running it..Apparently, all I should
have to do is type tf, but when i do this, the server version is run(not my
updated version).  can anyone help?

Thanks in advance.

Simple answer.  You need to unpack the file, and compile the code :)

Okay, I discovered a potentially nasty problem today.  When something happens in
a background world, it becomes the active world for second.  If I happen to be
sending commands to the foreground world while this happens, they can go to the
background world as it switches back and forth.  The timing is such that it
won't happen often, but imagine that I'm working on my test copy of the mud, and
I type "shutdown die" just as the the worlds switch.  This would be bad...

I'm running 3.5 beta 1 if it matters.

This is a shell question, it has nothing to do with tf.  Your PATH
environment variable determines what directories and in what order your
shell searches for an unqualified command name.  So you can change your
PATH, or type in a fully qualified name like "./tf" or "$HOME/tf".

Please, no more replies on this subject.

There's a good chance that the old version is really high up in your
PATH.  Hence, when you type TF, thats the first one that gets called.
You can make the new version the one you wantr by putting the path to
it as the start of your PATH :)

Not true.  The background world is "current" (that's the correct term,
not "active") ONLY for any triggers/hooks/variables/etc executed or
evaluated as a direct result of text or events from that background
world.  It is not made current globally "for a second" or any other time
period; it is guaranteed to not affect any other command or variable
you type at the command line or run by a /repeat or /quote.  The only
possible exception is if a background text or event triggers a macro that
explicitly calls /fg, and in that case you get what you ask for.

You need to specify the exact path location to the new installed TinyFugue. For
example /home/sym/tf/tf or ./tf if you're in it's directory. Or you could put
the new TinyFugue's directory ahead of your system-wide's TinyFugue directory
in your path. Or ask your sysadmin to install the new version :-)

Hiya,
  Just add the . directory to your path, or simply run tf by typing
"./tf".
Hope that helps.

Hiya.

Hmm, well, depending on what sort of shell you're running, change the path
that's assigned to the command tf.  Like, for example, to define that you
want to run the tf in your $HOME instead of the one on your server, in,
say, for example, a .cshrc file, if you're running csh/tcsh, put:

alias tf '~/tf'

Meaning, this 'll do that when you type tf, it runs the tf in your home
dir instead.

Well, I've sent a stream of commands to the foreground world, and had one of
them execute in the other world.  I thought it was limited to instances like
that, send a bunch of commands with no delay by using /quote.  But, earlier
today it happened on a single command, the timing was just right.  I hit enter
and could figure out what happened until I switched and saw the response in the
world that was in the background.  So, it does happen somehow, under some sort
of conditions.  I have a lot of gags/triggers defined, perhaps they're sneaking
thru as they are being processed.

Help! How do I recover from this!...
Using TF, and then I accidently press ctrl-u (or it could be ctrl-y, I'm not
sure and I don't intend trying again!) and then TF freezes, but the world
output carries on. Only I can't input anything other than with ctrl-[anykey]
which isn't much use because all I can then do is ctrl-c and I can't press "x"
to exit and restart TF so I have to relog in and kill the process then TF again
:(

I tried it on a Win95 box (256 colors, 640 X 800 pixels) and it runs okay.
I do find that in a Win environment I miss being able to exploit the Win95
environment (even in Linux [Redhat Xwindows] I get scroll bars).  I don't
think I would use it regularly in Win95 as it stand now (I use GMud when in
Win95 which does allow me to exploit the environment).  Just my two cents
worth.

I have a similar problem. I start TinyFugue from fvwm2 in an xterm with
no shell underneath it, and occasionally I hit control-z accidentally,
and TF tries to suspend, leaving it 'dead'. I can't get it back at all.
In fact, the only way I can get rid of the process is a SIGKILL (kill
-9).

Is there any way I can tell TinyFugue to ignore the ^Z key sequence?


Thanks.

	To my knowledge, this is not the "official" TF Win95 port being done by
Hawkeye, is it? I assume this is the (substandard in my evaluation) port done
by Justin Harvey. 
	Me, I'm waiting until Kevin/Hawkeye/Mr. Keys puts out his port. I'm stuck on
a win95 box, until I get a new Linux box (I need to use several programs in
win95 at my home office), and I miss a good client. :)

Not a TF question, but I'll answer it. :)

Easy way is to actually call a wrapper, IE: tf-batch, along the lines
of "xterm -e tf-batch".

tf-batch is simply:

stty susp undef
tf

I understand, and no, it isn't the official port.  I just wanted to see
what it looked like (I couldn't resist).

This is really a shell question, not related to tf.  But in unix shells,
^Y is usually delayed suspend, similar to ^Z.  You usually bring the
suspended process back into the foreground with the command "fg".

TF will usually detect when the parent process (xterm, in your case) does
not support job control, and will not honor SIGTSTP (the signal generated
by ^Z).  But even when this is not detected, you can resume tf (or any
other suspended process) by sending it a SIGCONT signal.  Real xterms
even have a menu command to do that from ctrl-leftbutton.

Right, I'm working on one, but haven't released it.  However, it will
not exploit any Windows features either, it will just be a direct port
of the official unix/os2 that will run in a console window.  (But you
can at least modify the properties of the window to start up at a size
other than 24 lines).  The advantages of the official version will be
that it is the current version of tf, and will continue to evolve as the
official version does; and that I've solved some problems that Justin
Harvey did not (at least according to my last communication with him).

That's Ken, not Kevin.  (And I know your name is really Alex, the top line
of this message is just to see how you like it. :) ).

but aren't things like pathnames and filenames compiled into the binary?
I had to fiddle with environment variables to get the other Win32 port to 
work... Since most windows users don't have a compiler, would they have
to always use the default dirnames?

Yes, default filenames are compiled in, but all of them can be changed
by setting environment variables before starting tf.  One variable,
TFLIBDIR, should be sufficient for most users.

Is there a way to suspend tf in a way that will allow it to continue to
act on incoming data even while it's still suspended, and not whenever
it's returned to the foreground? I tried once to first suspend it, then
use bg to make it a background process rather than a halted one, but I
don't think it had the effect I was looking for. Also, if there's a way to
do this, will I then have to do a /recall in order to see any text that
may have been received while it was in the background?

TF does not detect this, and I don't understand why. IRC, Pine, and
various other programs I run 'raw' under xterms have no problem figuring
out that ^Z won't work and ignoring it. Having ^Z cause tf lock up also
locks up my xterm, (or nxterm, color-xterm, rxvt...) to the point that I
can't use the ctrl-leftbutton. I can't send the SIGCONT either, it's
totally ignored.

I'm at the point that I am suspecting tf is at fault here.

However, the wrapper that was suggested works, I just make the shell
exec tf so it doesn't remain in memory.


Thanks,

^u and ^y does nothing to my tf, perhaps it was ^z, the stop signal. You
can type:
kill -26 -1 in a shell on the same server to continue all stopped

I doubt it... most shells will automatically suspend a program that tried 
to write to stdout while in the background.  So I guess you could do it 
if you redirected tf's output to /dev/null,  but that'd mean you could 
NEVER see any output.

Didn't try it, but it might ne possible to nohup tf. Make a script in tf
which logs ya into your mud, and nohup tf calling the script. Any ouputs
will go to a file called nohup.out.

Investigate the program 'screen'.

You need one of the recent versions if you want to have color though.

No.  A TF process can run in "batch" mode without a terminal, or
interactively with a terminal, but the same process can't do both.  A
background process that does tries to do terminal i/o can be made to
behave in one of two ways:  it can block until it regains control of the
terminal by being brought into the foreground, or it can be allowed to
do its i/o, ignoring any other process that is using the terminal at the
moment.  But the process can never know if it is in the background or
foreground, so it can't know when to avoid i/o but continue computing.
(Actually, this could technically be done by splitting tf into two
processes, one that does terminal i/o and one that does everything
else, but it's not worth the effort.)

As someone else already mentioned, the "iscreen" (or just "screen") program
is a good alternative to this problem.

I'm using Tf 3.5b1 under OS/2, running full-screen.

1)  ANSI colors aren't shown correctly.  I have emulation set for ansi_attr,
and I've tried loading color.tf.  The problem is that bright colors are 
shown with an orange background, when they shouldn't have a bg color.  
I have beta 4 on one of my unix accounts, and it has a similar problem.  
Bright colors are shown correctly, but gray (color 8 from my BASIC days) 
isn't shown at all-it's black on black.

2)  How do I get Tf not to automatically enter the first world added in 
world.tf?

3)  The mud I get on has a two-line prompt.  How do I get tf to put both 
of them in the prompt window?

I've tried to find info concerning these questions, but have been without 
luck.

Thanks for any help y'all can provide!

	I've been having a problem with ^S and ^Q.  I understand what 
they normally do, however, in this case it seems that after I (normally) 
mistakenly hit ^S, the transmissions freeze as per normal.  When I hit 
^Q, I start receiveing again, however, I'm completely unable to hit 
anything at all, and have any characters appear on screen at all.

	Then only way to get back into a typeable mode, I have to use ^Z 
(Which gives me an error or some kind, not sure exactly), and quits 
TinyFugue, forcing me to restart.

	Anyone have any ideas?

 I need to make a trigger that trigs on the text "*tells*", so I can make
it beep when someone does that. Well, I've done that, and it's working
fine (/def -ab -F -t'*tells*' beeptell).

 Now my real problem is I want this trigger to start when I've been idle
for 5 min, e.g. 5 min has elapsed since I last pressed a key.

 Now I tried doing this with the following SEND hook:

/def -ag -h'SEND *' ibt = %0%;/kill %ib_pid%; \
 /repeat -0:05 1 /def -ab -F -t'*tells*' beeptell%; \
 /set ib_pid=%?

 ..which gave me "% too many recursions", which I guess is due to the fact
that the SEND hook trigs on the %0 it sends..


 What I want is either 1) a way to access idletime and create a hook from
that or 2) a way to access input on keyboard rather than things sent to
the mud. (Tried -b'*', but didn't work)

 Please tell me there is another way than just making the SEND hook an -n1
and then having it create a new one when it's sent the text to the mud..

Try something like this: 

/def -ab -F -t'*tells*' beeptell=\
 /if ($[idle() > 300])%;\
   /beep%;\
 /endif

 Thanks, that's what I was looking for, except that I'll have to remove
the -ab in the trig, or it will always beep when telled to, and beep twice
if I've been idle.. :)

I was wondering about the status of the Windows NT port of TF.  Is it
still in the pipeline?  Any expected release date?  I have just shifted
the bulk of my development time to NT, and I'm lost without TF :).

It will be released when I find the time to finish it.  I'll announce it
on this list when I do.

I can do most simple highlights now, but I'm having trouble with the
following one:

a partial highlight of the expression: ['channel'] 

where 'channel' may change. One game I am on, the chat channel output is
prefixed with '[ ]' rather than '< >' or just '>' like the other games I am
on.

You just need to escape the []s since they're also regexp characters... try
-t'(\[.*\])' in your partial highlight trigger.

Hi, 

I think your problem is, that /for fails if the part in the loop is too 
complex (at least I had some problems with that a time ago). Try to 
replace it with the code which /for should produce:

I did not test it, still I hope it helps.

How would I go about writing a macro that would send a message to any MUSH
that was *not* in the foreground every 'x' minutes (say 6), to keep me
active, say the letter 'z', since it dosn't activate commands on any game I
play, THEN gag that error message: 'Huh? (Type 'help' for help) so that I
don't get an 'activity in world XYZ' unless there's other activity?

Now that I've rambled that out...here's what I need assistance with:

I need a macro to keep myself from getting too idle. I only want it to
check connections that are NOT in the foreground, that way if I 'alt-w' and
change worlds, the world the idler sends messages to changes also.

I want the idler to send the message 'z' to any world I am idle in every 6
minutes. Since this will give me an error message, I want to 'gag' that
text or otherwise cause TF to not react to it, so that it won't give me an
'activity in world XZY' message when 'Huh? (Try 'help' for help.)' comes
up. I still want activity messages when other things happen in the
background world(s).

Is this all possible in TF without sacrificing babies to demons, or
vice-versa?

Here's what I use, to send an echo to every world when I am idle.  It can
be adapted to serve your needs:

/def chime=\
  /if (idle() > 600) \
    /def chime_=/echo -ah -w%%1 $[ftime("%T", time())] %;\
    /mapcar /chime_ $(/listsockets -s) %;\
    /undef chime_ %;\
  /endif %;\
  /repeat -1:00 1 /chime

and in .tfrc:
/eval /at $[mod(ftime("%H",time())+1,24)]:00:00 /chime

Instead of an echo, you can just send some text.  Also, you should
do a comparison in /chime_ to see if %1 is equal to ${world_name}.  Be
careful of the number of % and $ you use, to ensure evaluation at the proper
times.

And at the same time as defining chime_, you can set up a quick gag of the huh
message, and undef it when you undef chime_.

Be aware that idle() returns the time since you last typed something into
TF, in any world, which may not be what you want (your idle time on each
particular world).  Trigger activation will not affect the idle() time.

Okay..

First of all, this is something you shouldn't do at home ;)

But I've got the following problem:

/set hp_%{L8}=%{L5}%;\
/set sp_%{L8}=%{L5}

works fine, and gives me things like hp_me hp_you, etc with the right
value in it.. However. When I try to reference it further:

/echo $[%{hp_%{L8}}]

It doesn't seem to want to accept the %L8 anymore. So my question is, how
can I reference a variable name within a function, and eval, and
operation, or whatever where the name consists partially of another
variable?

Help is much appreciated ;)

Mad.

This is what I use for MUSHes with idle timeouts. It's easy, it's simple,
and since you have to activate it by hand for any new world, you have full
control over what world are affected and you can always just use /kill.

/def -i id = \
    /echo %% Idle timeout avoidance started for this world.%; \
    /idle_a

/def -i idle_a = \
    /repeat -w -0:30 1 /idle_b

/def -i idle_b = \
    @pemit me=%; \
    /idle_a


Once logged into a MUSH, I just type /id and then it starts the sequence
that sends an empty @pemit to there once every 30 mins, which doesn't
trigger your activity signal and annoy you needlessly. There's a lot
better ways I'm sure it could be done, I just threw this together in a
second for myself.

Based on various bits of help sent to me when I asked about the idler
feature...I've come up with what I think I want to do. Please let me
know if this *should* work, because its dosn't send any emits, I
don't know if it works or not...

I want to send the message '@@' to every world I'm connected to every
six minutes:

/def idler = /send -W @@%; /repeat -0:06 1 /idler

I have some working code that partially highlights 'channel' output.
It highlights the name of the channel if it appears between two
square brackets: '[channel]'

However, I now get ANYTHING that appears between two square brackets,
which can get messy on my screen at times...including when
@decompiling mush objects.

How do I change the following partial highlight to only highlight if
the '[channel]' appears first in any particular line, not after other
stuff?

/def -i -p1 -P0Cred -mregexp -F -t'\[.*\]' tt_channels

Yep, it looks right.
You can check if it's working, more or less, by "/mecho on" and watching
the debug trace.

Or, if you have one available on your system, pop yourself into an editor
for a few minutes, and look at what TF sent to the socket that way.
(A good use of a mucker bit on Tinymucks.)

I have a question regarding a trigger I want to set up.. On one of the muds 
I play on, the situation is this:
it tells when players connect and disconnect by saying
[ <player> has connected]
when it says that, I want to do this:
tell <player> hi
I tied (err tried) this
/def -t'*has connected*' = tell %1 hi
but the brackets are in thewway. so it tries to tell the bracket hi, and 
natuarlly the bracket isnt a player..so I get they arent here or something. 
can someone suggest something else that I can try to do?
thanks
Cary

That won't work, '[' is a special character in a regexp.

If there really is a space between the '[' and the player name, all you
need to do is change your %1 to %2.  Otherwise, you need a regexp with
parentheses:

  /def -mregexp -t'^\\[(.*) has connected\\]$' greet = tell %P1 hi

Also notice I gave the macro a name, "greet".  It's always a good idea
to name your macros, to avoid duplication and make them easier to find.

you'll have to escape the [] characters since they're used in regexp..
that way it would be 
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'\[ (.*) has connected\]' sayhi = tell %p1 hi

or as a glob (if the person's name is only one word)

/def -p1 -mglob -t'[ {*} has connected]' sayhi = tell %2 hi

I won't even get into how annoying auto-greeters are, both on irc and on mu*s.

The player isn't the first word - it's the second.  So use %2 instead.

However, PLEASE do not implement this.  Automatic greet macros are largely
despised on muds of all kinds, as they are impersonal and just add
to the spam.

(And if you did it on a mud I was on, I'd probably /gag you.)

Cary,


I forgot you need to include a \ to escape the [ and ].

So...

/def -p1 -mregexp -t'\[ (.*) has connected\]' sayhi = tell %p1 hi

/def -p5 -mregexp -t'(.*)has connected]' has_connected = tell ....
... after the ... is where I am stuck.  

Maybe someone else can take over from there -

Ok, I have some friends like like to see my mush battles.  But their on 
another world.  So at the advice of some TF experts I made a 'sending' 
macro.  (at least a primitive one).

/DEF -p1 -w'World_One' -t'?*' show_1to2 = /SEND -w'World_Two' spoof one| %*

First problem:  lines that wrap:  because the '|' is only prefixed infront 
of the beginning of a multi-line item.

Second problem:  I want to be able to turn this on and off without 
retyping the whole thing when I want it on.

Two possibilities: Define a macro /show1to2on which executes the macro
definition of show1to2 in its body, and another macro /show1to2off which
undef's show1to2 again.
  The other possibility would be to define the macro with the option
-c100 (10 percent probability) and to /edit it to -c0 if you want to
switch it off.

This is a known bug in Solaris 2.4 and 2.5, not in tf.  It usually happens
when a large block of text arrives.  The only solution is to get Solaris
patches from ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/patches/patches.html.

Those are expanded because they are the in the body of a macro (I'm assuming
this is an excerpt from a /load file, and you left out the /def).

The $[] is expanded because it's in the macro body; the outer %{} is expanded
becuase it's in $[]; but the inner %{} is not expanded because it's inside
%{}, which does not do expansion.  To force extra expansion, use /eval
and the right number of escapes (eg, extra %'s):

  /eval /echo $$[%%{hp_%{L8}}]

See the /help topics: evaluation, substitution, /eval

Hi! I'm new here in this mailing list and don't know, if it is annoying
question here already, but looks like tf itself doesn't contain FAQ-like
help and haven't find it from the home page at
http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/ too.

If it doesn't exist, then the answer that I'm searching for is, has
someone experience or even macros to share about file-input-output? I'd
like to try to write to my character an autopilot that can learn a little
from its own experience. But the problem needs to keep some data in files.
As I have understood the tf does contain some commands for loading and
saving files, but looks like they are a littlebit unconvenient for complex
file-handling. If somebody has tried to make some utilities for fileworks
in tf, is it possible to hear about experience? I'd appreciate it?

Well I have a problem with file loading.
Then starting tf - tf automatically connected to the first world and
loaded trigs file associated with that world.
That is fine..
But i connected to one more world and realized that both worlds contains
the identical set of trigs ( i.e. world1 trigs + world2 trigs.)
Whats is more! after quiting from world tf still keeps /def associated
with that world.

Can anyone suggest me how to prevent tf from join /def in one piece, and
how to force automacital purge of world's /def then the world is closed
?

 Thanks,

why don't you just use -w'whatever' when /def'ing things, that way, they'll
only work on the worlds they're supposed to.

Sorry its taken so long - but you could try

/def -t"{*} has connected*" Hiya = tell $[substr(%1, 1)] Hi!

Works for me.

Our, if you prefer regular expression:

  /def -p1 -mregexp -P1B -aCmagenta -t'(.*) has connected' Hiya = \ 
    tell %P1 Hi!

Just to be fancy :P

Hello everyone,

I have been lurking on this list for quite some time trying to absorb
something of how to take advantage of the capabilities in tf.  I decided
to give porting some triggers from GMud to tf a shot.  For the most part
it has been a dismal failure.  the following give me ummatched [ error
(which I don't know how to fix and would really like to have because the
MOO I want to get to has ANSI which is the reason for the brackets) or
(in the case of the last one) it
thinks I am looking at something and tells me it doesn't see those
things
when all I want is to add those features using the @addfeature function
on
the MOO where I go a lot.

/def -mglob -t'[Please type the name you wish to be known as.]'
=\[\bold][random]r[bold][random]a[bold][random]j[bold][random]i[bold][random]n\
/def -mglob -t'[Please enter a brief description of yourself.]' = I said
for sustas only did I not? 
/def -mglob -t'You typed: * Is this what you want? [Enter `yes' or `no']
/def -mglob -t'Pacifica beckons you to go SOUTH.' = @addfeature #9682
@addfeature #3076 @addfeature #3988 @lookdetect @addfeature #12488
@addfeature #6367 @addfeature #16814 @paranoid 


I know these are very basic, but I am painfully new at this.  Can anyone
tell me how to make my other triggers work at all (they are the /def
-mglob variety as well but they aren't doing anything even though tf
says
it /loads them fine) and how to fix these...symbols and all?  Any
direction/advice/assistance would be highly appreciated.

Mel

I'm using 3.5b4, first off.

Part of my .tfrc:
/def BINDFILE = ~/tf-dir/tiny.bind
/loadbind

Not a problem, it loads great. But...

Part of a world specific file (ie: /addworld world host port [file])
/require ~/tf-dir/tiny.bind

I get:
% /usr/local/lib/tf-lib/~/tf-dir/tiny.bind: No such file or directory

	I know what is happening here, but I find it a pain to deal with. 
Is there any possibility or getting a ${LOCALTFDIR} set up? And then just 
add a switch to /require to check it?
(/require -l tiny.bind)

	Yes, I know I don;t need to load it a second time, but I was 
testing something. Which bring me to my next point.

In that same world file:
/require tiny.XP_counter

	Now, it was my understanding that /require would not load the 
file if it had already been loaded. But everytime I reconnect to that 
world I get spammed by redefs. Am I entering it wrong, or is this a bug? 
And yes, it's in the ${TFLIBDIR}

Is there a way to set up /more as world specific? 
Perhaps:

/more [-wworldname] [on/off]

Where leaving out the worldname made it global, while with the worldname 
it only set that specific world.

I'm just tired of turning it off in the mud, getting activity on the moo 
and switch to find the conversation has scrolled off my screen so I need 
to turn .more on, then /recall. And then switching back to the mud, and 
having to tab (yes, yes, esc-j, I know) thru the battlespam and finally 
just turning /more off again. Repeating the whole process 5 minutes later.

Sorry, venting.

I suggest you start with reading /help glob and then put backslashes
before every square bracket, to discard its special meaning.

First of all, every library file as a statement like
/~loaded filename.tf

This makes sure it is added to the list of %_loaded_libs.
If you want to use something like require in your own files, you _will_
need to add something like /~loaded filename.tf to your own files
as well.

Sure. The /require macro is defined in the standard tf library file.
You can simple redefine this yourself by putting something like
this in your own .tfrc:

/def -i require = \
	/if (!getopts("l")) /break%;/endif%;\
    /let LIBDIR=$[opt_l ? LOCALTFDIR : TFLIBDIR]%;\
	/expr LIBDIR%;\
	/if /@test _loaded_libs !/ "*{%{1}}*"%; /then \
		/load %{LIBDIR}/%{1}%;\
	/endif

Note: since /require is in the standard library, it may be redifined
in a new releas (e.g. for efficiency purposes).
In that case - using this redefine - you wouldn't be able to use
/require anymore to load the standard library files...

The simple solution in this case seems to be:

/def -h'WORLD bgworld' moreon  = /set more on
/def -h'WORLD fgworld' moreoff = /set more off

Where bgworld is the world you by default have in the background,
and fgworld the other world.

But what do you want? On the mud, to skip through all the battlespam and just
see the recent stuff?  I've got these:

/def -b'^[j' newflush = /dokey selflush %; /recall 10
/def -b'^[J' newselflush = /dokey selflush %; /recall 10

So when I esc-j, I still get to see the most recent stuff.

	Hi.
	I wanted to do something, but I don't really know how to do it.
	I wanted to:

1. Change the default LOGFILE. Right now, the default is tiny.log, but I
wanted to change it.

2. I wanted to change it to something, like the result of 
	
	/eval /echo $[ftime("%d%m%H%M",time())]    [.txt]

for example. In a way that, when I type   /log on  now, for example, the
default log file would be  25071035.txt  and if I disconnect and connect
again, or type /log off and   /log on ten minutes after, the default
logfile would be   25071045.txt

I saw that LOGFILE is defined in the stdlib.tf file, but I'd prefer to do
this changes in the .tfrc file, because I'm letting other people to use my
tf, and I don't know if they want this change aplied to them.

If I do change sdtlib.tf, do I have to recompile tf? I don't think so, but
I'm not sure.

I think it's all for now.
Thanks in advance.

Well go ahead: /def logfile = anyname.log

You can give /log another argument than on or off: the name
of the file you want to log to. So you could simply make a
macro like:

/def log_on = /log $[ftime("%d%m%H%M",time())].txt

You can simply redefine any macro in the stdlib in your own .tfrc.
However you shouldn't do this, unless you find no other solution.

Thanxs. That's What I needed.. I tryed this before, but it didn't work.
Now I remembered that it was because I executed the macro with  log_on
and not with  /log_on  @:)

Hello.
I have a few questions that need answering..
first, how do I get fwrite() to work? When I access the help file for it, it 
says that you append the string t to file s
but while in tf, when I type /fwrite (<filename>,<string> ) it doesnt work.  
Is there a file I need to load to make fwrite() work?
also, I have a directory called tf for all my macrofiles, and my worldfile 
tiny.world.  The problem Im having is when I add a new world to the tiny.
world file, it creates a new tiny.world file in my main directory, it doesnt 
overwrite the tiny.world file in my tf directory...  I found a invisible 
macro called worldfile that looks like I can change, but how do I change it, 
where is that macro located???  do I just put the changed worldfile macro in 
my .tfrc file before I load the tiny.world file in my tf directory, or is 
there a place where I can change the default load worldfile in somewhere 
else?  Im confused.. and I hope this is making sense :)
thanks so much for your time and I sincerely apologize for this message 
being so long.
Cary

fwrite is a function, not a macro. You can read in /help functions how
you should use those. An example is /test fwrite("filename", "string")

How do you add the world to your tiny.world file?
If you are using /saveworld, then just give the desired filename as
an argument (e.g. /saveworld ~/tf/tiny.world).

Hmmm I didn't get that last part, but that prolly is my fault...

From a (possibly old?) distribution, modified to taste. Pertinent lines
have been selected; I believe this is in 'tfrc.eg' or something like that
in the library directory.

;;; Enter the directory where you keep your tf files.
/cd ~/tf

;;; Define default filenames for /load*, /save*, and /log commands.
/def MACROFILE	= ~/tf/macros.tf
/def WORLDFILE	= ~/tf/world.tf
/def LOGFILE	= tiny.log

/loadworld
/loaddef

Hope that helps.

If I create gags for certain worlds then I don't see whatever I've gagged,
naturally. But using /log -w'whatever' logs all output from the world including
what I've gagged. How can I make TF only log what I see from a given world,
after gags etc?

Ok, last time I brought this up I was flamed to death, but I'm going to 
try again (the masochist that I am).

I am one of the odd users of tinyfugue that does NOT use visual.  I have 
often been told that there's no point to TF without visual, but that is a 
debate for another day.  One of my problems with Visual is a lack of 
understanding to edit the status bar.

Let us say I wanted to add a watchfor.  So that TF would automatically 
finger an account (or other method) and see if a person is online, and if 
they are, add their name in a set of brackets or something to the status 
bar.  (obviously I wouldn't want many names in this list).

Is it possible to do this?  Any possible implementation ideas?

I know a great many people who use tf without visual, and to great effect.
I'm not one of them, but my understanding is that they use tf -because- it
doesn't require visual mode.

> Is it possible to do this?  Any possible implementation ideas?
Way back in the dawn of time, when I was moving from MUD to MUSH, I also
moved from tintin++ to tinyfugue. While I find myself happy with both
decisions, I distinctly recollect spending the better part of a weekend
trying to figure out how to add my stats/mana/moves/align/experience
display to my status bar, like I had set it up in tintin.

I never did discover a way to put anything at all into the status bar. It
seemed to be limited to predefined fields. If I'm wrong, please correct
me. I would -love- to be able to use that space...

Hello,

	I am having such a problem understanding how the timing works, it
seems to me that no matter what I do, macro commands are processed
asynchronously.  I mean short of using the /REPEAT command, unless it goes
down to milliseconds, it isnt much use in timing.  I have a notion, from
what I have seen in the example scripts that the stacking of '%' symbols
may have something to do with it.  I have looked in the HELP and have not
found anything on this.  I have enclosed a prtion of code that I am
working on.  Thanks in advance for any help. :)

P.S.-> I know its buggy, I just threw it together ...

Thanks again,
- Scott

	/let variable_2 $[20 - strlen(variable_1)]%;\
        /for i 1 variable_2 /let variable_3 $[strcat(variable_3," ")]%;\
        /eval /echo I want %variable_2 spaces here >%variable_3<

	This technique does not work, and to be honest I am not sure
why... anyway, Thanks in advance for any help you provide.

MUSH code sux for online editing, so unless someone has an online editor 
they want to give out, here's what I was thinking.

1.examine object
2.fliter a recall for the attribute you want to edit
3.log that single line to a file
4.startup some editor with that file in it (in a mode that doesn't use CRs)
5.---edit file---
6.exit editor
7.set attribute on the object to the contents of the file

The following code chunk is wishfull thinking. (the way I wish it worked)
However, you can see from it what I'm trying to do and can't get to work.

/DEF propedit * *=			\
	examine %P1;			\
	---pause for examine to finish---
	/log %P1.%P2;			\
		/recall 250 %P2*;	\
	/log off			\
	/sh pico -nowrap %P1.%P2;	\
	&%P2 %P1=/exec /quote '%P1.%P2

Ok, so I'm a complete loser... take pity on me and solve my problem *grin*

I to have wanted to do some things with the status bar. Even add a second 
status bar across the top of the screen. Here is what I have found on how 
to do this.

Nada. Zip. Zilch. Zero. Squat. *NOTHING*. Unfortunatly, it just ain't 
possible. Maybe if enough of us get together and complain, Mr. Keys (bow 
down and worship) will add this feature some time in the future.

Until then, I suggest you look up /prompt and see if you can make 
something usable out of it. Not exactly what you are looking for, but it 
might be sufficient.

Here's something I wrote for Tinymuck Fuzzball, that could be adapted
to your purposes.

Usage:
/editprop <object>=<prop>
The string for setting that property is put into the keyboard buffer.
If more than one property is listed, it picks the last one.
 
Expects the mud to output something that looks like this:
(for example) ex me=sex
str /sex:female
1 property listed.
 
e.g. I type: /editprop me=sex (or /editprop me sex)
I get in the keyboard buffer:  @set me=sex:female (and then I can edit it
as I wish).


/def editprop=\
  /if ({#} == 1) \
    /let object=$[substr({1},0,strstr({1},"="))] %;\
    /let prop=$[substr({1},strstr({1},"=")+1)] %;\
  /else \
    /let object=%1 %;\
    /let prop=%2 %;\
  /endif %;\
  /def -aGg -w${world_name} -q -F -mregexp -t"^(int|lok|ref) /?%prop" \
    otherprops_ %;\
  /def -aGg -w${world_name} -q -F -mregexp -t"^str /?%prop" catchprop_=\
    /set grab_prop_=%prop%%PR %;\
  /def -aGg -w${world_name} -1 -t"{*} {property|properties} listed." \
    propdisp_=\
    /grab @set %object=%%grab_prop_ %%;\
    /undef catchprop_ %;\
  ex %object=%prop %;\
  /repeat -10 1 /purge catchprop_ %%; /purge propdisp_ %%;\
    /purge otherprops_ %%; /unset grab_prop_

Works great for online editing.. if your editing large pieces of code
though, you might want to try /visual and /set isize=10 or so.

Thats quite interesting, however for FuzzBall there is softcode available
to do just that.  All you need is the simple one line trigger:
/def -fg -p100 -t"##edit> *" = /grab %-1

If they are using the standard set of MUF for FuzzBall there should be a
command 'edit' that will send the properly formatted string and get the
input back.  If not, cmd-edit is available from
ftp.belfry.com/pub/fuzzball/fbmuf.

I believe there is something similar for MUSH that uses a slightly
different trigger, but I wouldn't know where to look for it.

Was wondering if anyone out there was using tinyfugue for Mordor muds.
Having some trouble figuring out how to make triggers...even after reading
throught the helpfiles.

From the prompt, I typed:

/def -t"A (%w) just arrived." combat1 = kill %1.

which I thought would triggert the macro combat1 to kill whatever just
arrived.  If anyone has some sample scripts with alot of simple triggers,
I'd really appreciate it if you could share them with me.  Sorry if my
problem sounds trivial, but I need help =(

True enough, the ability to customize the status line would be cool 
and useful.

/def test1 = \
  /let variable_1=Some_name %;\
; unnecessary, unless you want it later
  /let variable_2=$[20 - strlen(variable_1)] %;\
  /let variable_3=$[strcat(">", \
                   strrep(" ", 20-strlen(variable_1)), \
                   "<")]%;\
  /eval /echo I want %{variable_2} spaces here: %{variable_3}

It doesn't work to do just:
  /let variable_3=$[strrep(" ", 20-strlen(variable_1))]
because when it gets printed out, it gets smashed to just "",
so I put some bordering characters on it with the strcat().

The strcat() is fine; you're losing the space in the macro-style call
(/let).  Use only expression-style syntax, and you'll keep the spaces.
In this case, replace
   /let variable_3 $[strcat(variable_3," ")]
with
   /test variable_3 := $[strcat(variable_3," ")]

Also, don't forget about strrep() and pad().  You can replace all that
calculation with a single command:
   /echo >$[pad(variable_1, -20)]<

Close, but that %1 should be %P1, to grab the string matched by the 1st
set of parentheses.  And it needs -mregexp.

  /def -mregexp -t"A ([^ ]+) just arrived." combat1 = kill %P1

I don't know where Lieu got that "%w", because there's nothing remotely
resembling that in the /help.  See /help triggers, patterns.

Default is glob matching, you are using regexp.  You also probably meant 
%P1 or %2.

Use one of these:

/def -t"A {*} just arrived." combat1 = kill %2

/def -mregexp -t"A ([^ ]+) just arrived." combat1 = kill %P1

You didn't say what you're trying to do, and I don't feel like taking
the time to carefully analyze your (overly) complicated code, but I
think your problem is a basic misunderstanding of how TF interacts with
a mud.  TF's code runs synchronously within itself (except for /quote
and /repeat); but not with the mud.  TF itself has no way of knowing
what (if any) results a mud will generate when you send it a command.
To TF, mud input and output are two unrelated streams of text.  If you
want to get the results of a mud command, you need to set up triggers to
deal with all possible mud outputs, before sending the command.

BTW, here's one bad practice I noticed:
>     /if /test $[regmatch(str_search,area_name)] =~ "1"%; /then

* Use =1, not =~"1", to test an integer result.
* regmatch() returns a 1 or 0, which is conceptutally "true" or "false";
  comparison is unnecessary.
* There's no need to nest $[] inside /test.
* "/if /test ... /then" can be simplified to "/if (...)".
Thus:
      /if (regmatch(str_search,area_name))

I'm trying to modify watch.tf to work as a /notify for my irc.tf script. I
know what i need to code, but I'm not quite sure how to go about it. Since
I can get a list of users online in a single line of output, it should be
a lot more efficient than the regular /watch. I can send the list of users
i want to check are on like this:

ison :name1 name2 name3 name4

And get back a string like this, say if name1 and name3 turns out to be
logged on:

:irc.whatever.com 303 mynick :name1 name3

Now what I need to do is have three variables, one that stores my list of
players to always check (mylist), one to read in the names found to be
currently logged on (newlist), and one to keep a list of names already
found to be on in previous checks (oldlist). First it should match newlist
to oldlist, and any names that are on the oldlist that aren't on the
newlist are ppl that have logged off, and it should echo a message
accordingly and then delete them from the oldlist. Then any names that are
on the newlist and aren't on the old are newly logged on ppl and messages
should be sent and the new users added to the oldlist.

I'm not doing what you're doing, but:


/def . = /set tester=$[rand()] %; \
	/def -mregexp -n1 -ag -t\"%{tester}>(.*)\" \
		autoedit=/input %%P1 %; 
	/if ({#} < 1) \
		/send think %{tester}>&%{attr} \
			%{object}=[get(%{object}/%{attr})] %; \
	/elseif (regmatch('(/)',{0})) \
		/set object=%PL %; \
		/set attr=%PR %; \
		/send think %{tester}>&%{attr} \
			%{object}=[get(%{object}/%{attr})] %; \
	/else \
		/set attr=%0 %;\
		/send think %{tester}>&%{attr} \
			%{object}=[get(%{object}/%{attr})] %; \
	/endif

This macro works a lot like the infamous 'fugued' MUSHCode object, but a 
little safer, since nobody can spoof you and make your shell do
embarassing things (like delete all your files or post your passwd file
to alt.2600). It's also got some additional facilities, inspired by 
Sandi Fallon's modifications to the fuged object:

'/. object/attr' grabs attr off object and puts it into your editing line
(whether visual or not), ready to strike 'Enter' and set it again.

'/. attr' grabs attr from the object you most recently edited.

'/.' grabs the last object/attr pair you edited.

Limitations:

If you name your attributes with embedded '/' characters, you'll need to
specify the entire object/attr to get it to work. Also, if you use an
object name that contains a '/', it'll screw up.

If you set yourself TRACE, you can end up with some Funky Stuff.

Either or both of these could probably be steered about with adequate
safeguarding in either the MUCode or the macro, but this has worked rather
well for me for the last few months.

Enjoy.

Actually, it's the lack of a _way_ to edit the status bar; it just isn't
implemented at all, or at least wasn't in the late 3.5a versions, and I
haven't seen it in the 3.5b either.

I actually patched it to do this once, around 3.5a19 IIRC, and it wasn't
horrendously difficult to do, but the main problem was that I kept running
out of room on the status bar! (I wanted extra indicators that work like
the tf ones -- ie, have a fixed place -- as well as character names etc
for the current world); I probably still have the patch at home somewhere
if anyone wants it. It'll need a bit of modification, though.

After thought, I ended up with a special variable containing the text for
the status bar, with each word prefixed by `+' (show it) or `-' (just
leave a space for it), and a set of macros to add, remove and toggle the
things, but it's probably possible to improve on this. The actual coding
of this was fairly easy (Kudos to Hawkeye!).

Can't find this in the docs.. is there any way (including hacking

dynamic?

Ok, I admit that I haven't payed much attention to this since I'm using
unix based machines 95% of my online time. But I have friends who only 
uses Win95 and they all get envious of me for beeing able to use TF. Now
for the question, was there someone who eventually made a full working
version of TF for win95? If so, where can it be found?

	I am trying to figure out how to make a macro so that I can do a:
/if (is_group(Lightn))
I have other macros that update the %group string to make it a space seperated
list of people in my group, I have tried various things, put cant seem to get
it to work, any help would be appreciated

Also, I have a prompt like this:
| 1425H 1225E 258V 5407530XP >
But while in battle, It can look like this:
| 1425H 1225E 258V 5407530XP [You: Hurt] [Tank: Good] [Enemy: Poor] >
or
| 1425H 1225E 258V 5407530XP [You: Hurt] [Enemy: Poor] >
I need to make 3 regexp that will activate on the messages, but I can only
suceed on making the first one work with this regexp:
/def -mregexp -i -F -p100 -h"PROMPT ^\| ([0-9]+)H ([0-9]+)E ([0-9]+)V (-)?([0-9]+)XP > " \
For the other 2 I tried this, but to no avail:
/def -mregexp -i -F -p100 -h"PROMPT ^\| ([0-9]+)H ([0-9]+)E ([0-9]+)V (-)?([0-9]+)XP \[You: ([^\]]+)\] \[Tank: ([^\]]+)\] \[Enemy: ([^\]]+)\] > " \

/def -mregexp -i -F -p90 -h"PROMPT ^\| ([0-9]+)H ([0-9]+)E ([0-9]+)V (-)?([0-9]+)XP \[You: ([^\]]+)\] \[Enemy: ([^\]]+)\] > " \

Any Ideas?
If alot of text is coming though to me, often the next line will get appended
to my prompt and thus will not get processed, any ideas on how to fix this
(besides lowering prompt_usec and causeing it to do wierd things to other
text, because it thinks it is a prompt...)

Thanks people :)

A macro that gags (-ag) the text that triggers it still gags the text if
it's /edited to -c0 ... this is a feature, right? :)

Something to keep in mind.

Hi all,

  I got the following problem with tf. I'm trying to write a trigger
that can allows people to give me commands in the mud.

The problem is that you don't know how long one command can be.
Example: hug walnut, take potion from bag and etc.

I wrote the following trigger:

/def -t"[A-Z]* tells you 'auto *'" = %-4

When someone tells me the next thing: Walnut tells you 'auto hug walnut'
The trigger executes "hug walnut'"

Of course I don't want the last char '.

Can someone help me or help me write a better trigger.

Also I'm trying to write a trigger that counts the amount of xp
I earned on a day for a character. I would be very happy if someone else
could me with that too.


Thanks all,

Sauw-Yuh

Yes, it's a feature.  The attributes -a, -P, -c, etc all only affect
the _body_ of the macro/trigger, not the text it is triggering on.
e.g. You can have a -c10 trigger set up which underlines the text it is
triggering on.. the trigger will only go off 10% of the time, but the text
will always be underlined.  Likewise with gags.

People _will_ abuse this if they know you have this trigger.
Like: Walnut tells you 'auto quit'
So I'm not sure if you really want this...

Something like this will fix that:
/def -mregexp -t"[A-Z]* tells you 'auto (.*)'" some_trigger = %P1

That totally depends on how the mud shows your xp.
Please give some more info on what text is shown.

Right, except for the bit about -a and -P.

-t, -m, -w, -p, -T determine if and how the macro matches the incoming text.
-a, -P affect displaying of the matched text.
-c only affects execution of the macro's body.

Somebody asked an interesting question yesterday I couldn't answer,
so I thought I'd check here...

Is there a way to purge whatever text is lying in wait in any of the
worlds that are backgrounded? It's a little troublesome to do a
/listsockets and see 500+ lines waiting on some other world and then
have to sit through a masssive bout of scroll while it all unfolds...

Probably not exactly what you're looking for, but if you have /more on,
then you can hit <esc>-j to immediately jump to the end of the buffered 
text.

-->Or perhaps you could type /more off to let all the text scroll

I deleted the original question, but the poster wanted a way to skip all

There is a way (added in 3.5 alpha 20 but not documented): /fg -q.

This query about purging backspam reminds me of a
question/request/whatever I had in mind. I do/did admin on several MU*s,
many of which had a Substantial Collection of channels. One of the
features in TF that made my life easy was the hilighting of channels: I
could 'color-code' my channels and simplify the task of pulling pertinent
information from a screenload of text.

Well, as long as I've only got one world going, this is okay. But when I
bring up world 2, the first sign of activity will be an '% Activity in'
message, followed by a stream of spam telling me about '% Trigger in'. Now
I know I can disable this by turning off background processing, which is
really a rather nice way to handle things...but if I do, I get no activity
warnings.

Similarly, if I don't turn off background processing, my hilighting
triggers will apparently 'overlap' and all colored text will emerge with
the color of the most recent trigger on it, not the color which it should
have. This also happens when I've got '/more' running.

For example:

/hilite Creation*
/hilite GAME:*=/set hiliteattr=Cred
Creation pages: hi                  # this line shows in boldface
---- World tir ----
% Activity in world bal
% Trigger in world bal
---- World bal ----
Creation pages: test                # now it's in red
GAME: Destruction has connected     # as is this

Make sense?

Anyway, the question is simply: is there a way to turn off that goofy '%
Trigger' spam without turning off the '% Activity' notice? If not, could
we add one?

Secondly, is there a way to make the stuff in backscroll spam color
properly?

/def your triggers with -q, this will let you keep really important triggers
with messages, and keep the others quiet.

rather than always using /hilite and changing the hilite color, use things
like /def -aCred to color specific things.

Instead of using /hilight, use /def

IE instead of
/hilight *Important text*
do
/def -q -aCred -mglob -t'*Important test*'

The -q makes it not trigger the % Trigger, and the -aCred sets the
attribute to Color red.  Look at /help attributes for other attributes
that can be set.

Hello!

I got a little problem there with a alias witch must turn on a trigger and 
later to turn it of ...

the alias is :

/alias action /def -mregexp -t"(.*)\*(.*)\*(.*)" hunt_it=kill %4

where the text is appearing in middle of 2 * 
like 
*a Human* is standing here.
it grabs Human as trigger and tries to hit it , it works cool with if
its only /def 

but i need it not all time while game prompt uses * too and it will cause
me get again and again new prompt whenim on on my fast linkand so it will
spam me a lot.

just might someone explain me why it does not work with /alias ?
what im doing wrong ?

Andrus Oolo.

I see that the TF web page mentions the possibility of a win32 TF.  Is
there a tentative timeline for this and how is it likely to be different
from regular TF?  I'm curious because I'm likely to lose shell access soon,
and maintaining my own Linux box is not easy.

Two things come to mind:

/alias action /def -1 -mregexp -t"^(.*)\*(.*)\*(.*$)" hunt_it=kill %P2

	-1	This will make the trigger a "one shot" and not spam you.

	-t"^(.*)\*(.*)\*(.*$)"	This will make sure of 2 things:
				1.  That the expression takes place at the
				beginning of the line.(^)

				2.  That the line is terminated, prompts, 
				(on diku and similar muds) use
				an unterminated prompt.  This will work
				well.

	I would also consider trying to make your triggers themselves less
	vague.  For example, instead of using (.*), it may be that all MOBS names
	begin with a letter and that the prompt contains numbers, therefore
	([a-z]*|[A-Z]*) would be a better trigger.

	The complete expression *I* would use, given the info provided,
	would be:	

	/alias action /def -1 -mregexp -t"^(.*)\*([A-Z]*|[a-z]*)\*(.*$)"hunt_it=\
		kill %P2

Hope this helped,

Note that inside of /alias % subs refer to things given after the alias
command like `action foo' foo would be %1.  And %P2 would be unbound at
this point.  So you need to quote it.  Also, since you are throwing out
the leading and trailing (.*) you can make it a bit faster by just

example of `*a human*', so you have to at least allow space as well.  If 
you want to just kill anything including numbers and punctuation change
the [A-Za-Z ] to [^*].

/alias action /def -1 -mregexp -t"\*([A-Za-z ]*)\*" hunt_it = kill %%P1

Thanks for the tips.. though I would not exclude the trailing $ to catch
the termination.. to avoid the spamming he was referring to withthe
unterminated pormpt... no?

triggers should only get applied to complete lines.  the only way to
match against an unterminated prompt is with the prompt hook, afaik.

in any case, at any point when a regexp for a trigger is compared the
'$' means the end of the string with which it's being compared, not a
newline or some sort of mud notion of termination.

`xx.*$' is equivalent pattern matching-wise to `xx'.  As is `^.*xx.*$'.
The only difference is what values %PL and %PR will have in each of
these cases.

Using ^.* can slow things down a fairly large amount.  A trailing .*$
has less of a performance effect, since the inital portion of the regexp
is already guaranteed to be maximal, so it doesn't waste any time
backtracking when completing the .* to the end.

Umm..

	Not to beat a dead horse.. but your statements about the $ are
incorrect to my understanding.. that interpretation is true in perl and
other scripting languages that use regular expression.  But in TF it
signifies the '\n', a newline.. it doesnt interpolate in reverse order as
does perl and others when you use the $.  Dont take my word for it.. in
the TF help docs it states:

	  An atom is a regular expression in parentheses (matching a
          match for the regular expression), a range (see below), `.'
          (matching any single character), `^' (matching the null
          string at the beginning of the input string), `$' (matching
          the null string at the end of the input string), a `\'
          followed by a single character (matching that character), or
          a single character with no other significance (matching that
          character).

	I first thought that it worked that way as well and was surprised 
when I read this in the TF documentation.  If I am in fact wrong, please
tell me since with the absence of the reverse matching I have used the $
matching alot.  

Thanks again,
- Scott

What part of `matching the null string that end of the input string' is
confusing?  The null string is an empty string, it is not a newline, it
is not any other special character or mud notion of termination.  It's
just a null string, in exactly the same way the ^ matches the null
string at the beginning of the input string.  The null string has no
relationship to the presence of a NUL character traditionally found at
the end of C string, nor does it have any relationship to a NULL
pointer.  It is referring to `null string' in the sense that regexps are 
finite state automata which match strings of symbols from a symbol set.


But don't take my word for it or the occasionally wrong documentation
(which is right in this case), read the regexp/regexp.c file, and note
that quite clearly there is no support for handing a notion of "partial"
lines to the regexp matcher.  The regexp matcher does not use newline as
the end of string match, it uses the NUL of a C string.  That will exist
at any point the regexp code is called.  If you're really want to look
into this, you can write a quick program on top of the regexp package
which sends string in to be matched against the regexp "$".  You'll soon
discover that you can't make any string which won't match that.


You can also find by reading the src/socket.c file and peering at the
handle_socket_input function that handle_socket_line is only called when
a newline has been seen (or the one special case when the connection to
the mud was lost while you had a partial line).  Since
handle_socket_line is the routine responsible for running triggers,
you'll see that a trigger can only be run on a complete line (except the
special disconnect case).  So not only does the regexp package not have
a notion of "$" meaning newline or some sort of other mud termination,
tf still only runs triggers against lines that ended with newline.
Either one of these conditions would be sufficient to make `x.*$' and
`x' the same for trigger patterns, and in tf you've got both.

I looked at it. I found a lot of interesting stuff there, but just what
I'm looking for, didn't find. I still try :)... Is there any experience
about filechemistry in tf walking around? If i don't get a positive answer
I'll try to do something on my own :), but just now trying to avoid
developing a possibly existing bycicle :) *lazylazylazylazy*... *yawn*...

The current version has /quote ' and fwrite() to read and write files.
I use these frequently for borg databases.

I've also added several new functions for the next release:

tfopen() opens a file for read, write, or append; or a pipe to a command
for reading; or a "queue" for reading and writing (eg, passing data
between macros).

tfread(), tfwrite(), tfclose() operate on a handle returned by tfopen().

Before you ask, I don't know when this next release will be.

Why not a read/write command pipe? I'd find *extremely* useful to 
pass mud data to programs such as awk, perl or even lex&yacc 
home-made programs, and get the output back. From what you said 
above, it seems this would not be too hard to do. But, then again, 
it's your time... :-)

Next thing I'll be wanting select(), and then you can ask me why the 
hell I don't *write* my client using common unix libraries... :-)

I've thought of that of course, and agree it'd be useful, but the
problem is that popen() only opens a one-way pipe.  To get two-way
pipes, I need to dive deeper into things like socketpair(), fork(),
exec(), and wait(), which greatly complicate portability.

Actually, a function that polls a set of handles might be reasonable.
But tf macros will always be limited by the fact that the tf "kernel"
is not multitasking; only one macro can run at a time.  I'd sooner write
a new client from scratch than try to make tf macros suspendable.

> And that, btw, gives me an outrageous (sp?) idea: libtf.a. ;->

You mean like %TFLIBDIR/*.tf?

As I understood that Mr. Daniel C. Sobral told about C library. Why not to
make a link between C code and tf code, so, that tf macros/kernel are/is 
usable also in C code? *DING*?

Nope. A library so I could really write a client of my own, specific 
to my needs, using TF goodies.

Hello,

	I am trying to write a simple script that will grab a random line
of text from a file and /send it.  At first I thought this would be
simple, but after reading what quote does, I have not figured out how to
select just 1 line.  Other than reading each line in until it gets to a
rand line i.e quoting $[rand(x,y)] line and the context of each line
simplyoverwriting the same variable.  But that would simply be
innefficient, I have just downloaded the newest version which has newer
file handling functions, but I would like this to be backwards compatable
if possible.  Other than porting to a Perl script, which is my next step,
is there any ideas.

Thanks,
- Scott Benjamin

P.S.- any talk of TF ever being able to define arrays?

Yes, it's inefficient, but that's the only way to do it unless you write
a random-line generator in your shell and just call that directly.
I used arrays above to store the lines to select from.

Hey,
	
	just wanted to say thanks.. saves me from coding it :)  Your code 
is alot tighter than I expected it could get using TF.

Anyway, Thanks again,

Some minor questions--I wouldn't even ask if my last question hadn't been
dealt with so successfully and helpfully, but since it was, I thought I'd
try my luck.

First: is there a way to force a connection to a world?

I mean, I'm assuredly overly lazy here, but I often have a couple or three
sockets open to a world, and just as often, will want to test to see if my
connection has dropped for one reason or another.

What I'm wondering is if there's anything out there that will work like
the /connect or /world commands that will allow reconnection to a world
definition (allowing that it may rename it in some what to make it behave
nicely)?

Also, has anyone assembled a set of vi-style keybindings? Or do they exist
already and I've missed them?

Again, just thought I'd check. Thanks.

There's actually an interesting way to pick a random line from a set of
lines without taking any extra storage.  As you go along you keep track
of a current pick.  You randomly decide to replace the pick with the
line you are now looking at.  Obviously if you did a 50% choice, it'd be
heavily weighted to the latter lines.  But if you pick a 1/N choice to
swap, you'll see that every line ends up with equal chance.  Macro to do 
such:

/def random_line = \
    /let selection=%;\
    /let lines=0%;\
    /quote -S /random_line_ `%*%;\
    /echo %{selection}

/def random_line_ = \
    /test rand(++lines) | (selection:={*})


you can use it the same way as Karen's.  Or if you know you're always
going to be using it on a file, you can add this for a bit more speed,
cutting out an intermediate /quote queue.

/def random_file_line = \
    /let selection=%;\
    /let lines=0%;\
    /quote -S /random_line_ '%*%;\
    /echo %{selection}

You can use variable names as arrays.

;;; /array_set VAR_NAME INDEX VAL VAL VAL...
;;; /array_get VAR_NAME INDEX

;;; /array_set x 1 Hi there.
;;; /array_set x 2 Yo.
;;; /array_set x 3 Buh.
;;; /array_get x 2  --echoes--> Yo.
;;; /array_get x 1  --echoes--> Hi there.
;;; /array_set x 1 die die die
;;; /array_get x 1  --echoes--> die die die

/def array_set =\
    /set array_%{1}_%{2}=%{-2}

/def array_get =\
    /eval /echo %%{array_%{1}_%{2}}


If you want to be able to index by more complex things, you can use
these:

/set array_str2id_str=\
    \!\@\#\$\%\^\&\*\(\)\_\-\+\=\|\\\~\`\{\[\}\]\:\;\"\'\<\,\>\.\?\/

/def -i array_str2id =\
    /let left=%;\
    /let right=$[tolower(%1)]%;\
    /while /let i=$[strchr(right, array_str2id_str)]%; /test i >= 0%; /do \
	/test left := strcat(left, substr(right, 0, i), "A", ascii(substr(right, i, 1)), "Z")%;\
	/test right := substr(right, i + 1)%;\
    /done%;\
    /echo -- %{left}%{right}


/def array_set =\
    /let var=$(/array_str2id %1)%;\
    /let key=$(/array_str2id %2)%;\
    /set array_%{var}_%{key}=%{-2}

/def array_get =\
    /let var=$(/array_str2id %1)%;\
    /let key=$(/array_str2id %2)%;\
    /eval /echo %%{array_%{var}_%{key}}


This'll let you do things like:
;; /array_set yo_mama_1 miyu@cave Hi there!!
;; /array_set yo_mama_1 voo@doo monkey
;; /array_set yo! \%ugh& oh gag me with a spoon
;;
;; /array_get yo_mama_1 miyu@cave --echoes--> Hi there!!
;; /array_get yo_mama 1 --echoes-->
;; /array_get yo! gfhj --echoes-->



Maybe I'll release my fairly generalized db package once 3.5b5 is
released (since it has /listvar).  It lets you easily define
"structures" and "arrays" and builds accessor functions for you, and can 
be setup to automatically save dbs to disk.  You can also do various
searches and loops over entries, etc.

I have a problem with using tf along with a proxy host. I don't know what 
type of proxy it is, but it might be a Gauntlet telnet proxy, as in the
'/help proxy'. 

I get the connection message from the mud, but then, when the name-prompt 
shows, I think it sends a LF or some other char, because it disconnects 
instantly. 

I think I have tried everything, including /purge -i, running as clean a
client as possible and doing everything manually, but still the same
result. I have used the same build for connection without a proxy, so the
client works in general. I have tried simple telnet to the proxy and then
to the mud, and that works, so it's not the proxy's fault. 

The mud I'm trying to connect to is mud.lysator.liu.se 2000, which is an 
LPMud (The oldest continously running with the original mudlib, or
something like that ;). I tried a couple of other muds too, but I was to 
tired to do any extensive research. 

If you have any ideas of how to solve this, please mail me (or the list).

Thanks. 

Henrik.

It's trying to log you in with a blank name and password, because
/proxy_command is not quite right.  Either delete the /trigger -hPROXY
command from proxy_command, or define a character name and password with
/addworld.

No, that is not it. 
I don't have a /trigger -hPROXY in the proxy_command definition, 
removing /trigger -hLOGIN will not help, and a world is defined. 
Still I cannot get it right. 
I have tried using the proxy via a WinGate proxy, and that worked. 

Here is the proxy_command definition:
/~loaded proxy.tf
/set proxy_host jynx2.student.uu.se 
/def -i proxy_command = \
    /eval \
	/def -p10000 -w -1 -h'prompt tn-gw->*' = \
	    /localecho on%%; \
	    telnet ${world_host} ${world_port} %%; \
	    /def -i -p10001 -w -1 -t'Connected to *'
proxy_success_${world_name} = \
		/eval /echo ${world_name}%%%;\
		/eval /echo ${world_character}%%%;\
		/eval /echo ${world_password}%%%;\
		/trigger -hCONNECT ${world_name}%%%;\
		/trigger -hLOGIN ${world_name}

All /echos give satisfying output. 
I just can't figure out what might be wrong. :(

Hello!

I have this little problem...

The mud I play on have alot of color changes, and I havn't found a way of
getting around this when matching triggers and such. Is there anyway for
telling tf to disreguard all color changes when patching patterns?

Atm, I have emultation=ansi_attr. 

Your's
 Bjorne

This is the way tf works already, as a matter of fact, I don't think it's
possible to access the colors at all, since they are stripped before any pattern
matching is done.  It's actually kind of annoying in some circumstances when you
want to adjust the incoming text before it displays.  You lose all the original
colors.

I use TF to connect to all my routers and a mud or two whenever I get the
time. Sometimes I want to change a value in all of the routers and it
would be nice if one could conntact all of them at once and broadcast
commands to all connected worlds (or to all worlds of the same type). Does
anyone have such a macro? For security reasons I don't want to write the
passwords in any files so it could be handy to broadcast the password to
all the worlds as well...

It would also be nice if one could see all the results in one window in
some format like this:

worldname1: text
worldname1: more text
worldname2: text
worldname7: text
worldname2: more text

Is this possible and how should I do it?

Regards,
Sebastian Andersson

Because of my job, I must often suddendly leave my keyboard to attend to 
business.  I'm looking to see if anyone has a macro (or can think of how
to write a macro) that would send sets of commands to every active world.

For example:
I'm a wiz on a MUSH, so this macro would need to send to that world:
	+duty AFK
	+com staff=AFK folks, work calls
	HOME
And then to another world:
	page Niffer Nightmare=sorry guys, AFK

etc,etc...


Oh, and someone posted here once a macro that went off when someone was 
idle.  Is it possible to set in a macro that it only goes off when I'm 
idle?  

Like maybe someone types "Bob, are you idle?"

And I would respond "yes" if I'm idle over 5mins or something?

Sure, just have in the body of that macro a lot of /send -w commands.

I'd actually try and make it so you can send something standard, myself.
If they're all MU(SH|X)es, I'd just define a T_IDLE_WARNING on my character
object, and do a global send of "@trig me/T_IDLE_WARNING".  YMMV. :)

I missed out a line. :)
Also keep in mind that you could use /tdef for this, and then substitute
%trig_actor for %speaker, etc. etc.

Hello Ken!

I have a question about keybindings on numeric keypad on vt100 terminal.
The point is that vt100 original key codes for numeric keypad are next:

vt100 keycode	key on numpad	text i would like to bind
-----------------------------
^[Or                2                 s
^[Os                3                 d
^[Ot                4                 w
^[Ou                5               exits
^[Ov                6                 e
^[Ox                8                 n
^[Oy                9                 u

The problem is TF uses numric keypad same as standard numeric keys are.
Maybe you have idea how to bind the num_keypad to send the meanings.

 I got a slight problem I'd like you to solve for me :). I want to make a
trig which triggers on idle time, for example, after I've been idle for 2
min, it will cast invisibility at me. How do I set this up without having
to constantly use /repeat -1 1 /if idle()=120?

	This is my code, and I'm having much difficulty with it.

	First off, I can't seem to get a prompt of 80 characters long. I have 
a wrap of 80 set, but if I change it to 81, I can fool it and get my 
prompt, but it has unwanted side effects. I've figured that this is to 
prevent multiline prompts. Well, that's sort of what I want. Is there a 
way to turn this off or disable it?

	My second problem is that the /prompt line (2nd from bottom) doesn't 
seem to be working anyway. I can't even get it to pass pure text. What am 
I do wrong here?

	For those of you who haven't guessed yet, I am trying to juryrig 
a second status bar that I can configure myself.

Prompts are assumed to fit on one physical line.  If you try to make a
prompt wider than the screen, only the last physical line of it will be
displayed (that is, the last (length mod wrapsize) characters).  This
may be considered a bug, but multi-line prompts are not particularly
useful or common, so I intentionally did not bother to support them.
You're trying to use it for something it wasn't intended for anyway.

If the length of your /prompt argument is an integer multiple of %wrapsize,
you won't see anything, for the reasons given above.  For lengths less than
%wrapsize, /prompt works as advertised.

TF 3.6, which is currently in the works and will probably be available in
September, already has a user-configurable status line.

I have a couple of "bugs" that may have already been reported...

First... there seems to be somekind of a bug regarding ANSI Colors... if
I color text with in tinyfugue (triggers and ansi colors) everything
works fine, but when the mud sends me ansicolor messages after
displaying the prompt, the prompt disappears... i'll tell it in an
another way to make sure =) When tinyfugue gets my prompt from the mud,
it puts it in another window (/visual on), but when the mud sends me
ansi-colors, it doesn't redisplay it... same thing with /visual off...
there's got to be some logical explanation to this...

Second... I don't know how that could easily be implemented, but I'm
getting pretty darn tired of having different keybindings for the Fkeys
and insert delete home etc keys... Sure they produce different
characters while i'm telnetting from my mac or using linux console or
using linux X, but isn't there some way to find out what they should be?
termcap, terminfo etc?

Well I'm really looking forward to the next version of tinyfugue... you
are really doing a great job Ken =)

TIA

Sorry about that second part in my last mail...

I haven't used tinyfugue for a while because I got behind a very nasty
firewall and it seems that the last time I read the help on keybindings
it was a little bit different =) Everything seems to be in order (except
that my BAFH is using SlackWare with a broken termcap...)

Well, replace e8917523 with dcs above and it should work. Well, it

	For those of you who have frequented RIverMOO, you all know that 
'wizzen' is a very degrading word. And you would also know that 
'bitsy-pookums' is obviously the proper plural for 'wizard'.

	You say 'tomato' I say 'rhutebagah'. Who cares?

why's this being discussed on the tf list? Although of course I do think
words like 'wizzen', 'prolly', and other non-word words are stupid, but still.

I want to be able to filter certain variables with a certain prefix, eg.
like variables such as prefix_a, prefix_b, prefix_c, etc., from a list of
all the other variables into a file on your home directory?

I'm after something on the lines, if you can catch my drift, on something
like...

(/set) | grep prefix > ~/file

I hope you understand what I'm driving at...

Many thanks in advance

Wait until 3.6, which has /listvar.  (Will allow searching for variables
with globs or regexps, just like you can do now with /list.)

/addworld dummyworld localhost echo
/histsize -wdummyworld 10

/def save_some_vars =\
    /if ({#} != 2) \
	/echo -e \% Usage: save_some_vars PREFIX FILENAME%;\
	/break%;\
    /endif%;\
    /let pattern=^/set %1[^=]*=%;\

    /log -wdummyworld off

/def save_some_vars_ =\

    /endif


Or you could just manually turn on logging and use /egrep to help you
weed them out.  In 3.6 you could avoid the /log by using the new
file/queue access routines.  You could use fwrite() now, but that's
slower than logging, since it would open and close the file on every
line.  You could also make save_some_vars_ a bit faster using a single
/test (like _egrep) by using optional args to echo().

Note that the prefix you give to save_some_vars can include regexp
patterns.


To use egrep, /require grep.tf.  And use it like:
/egrep color /set

I personally enjoy using commands like
/wc /egrep smurf /recall 0- Hawkeye*
which seems to hit 5 entries on druidmuck[1].  Of course sticking that
pattern in the /recall would be faster, but where's the fun in that??

As much as I appreciate the advice, I must admit my patience level tends
to be at a minimum at times, I'm not one that likes to wait... What if I
wish to be able to work on this idea now? Any suggestions as to what to
do?

PS: How come I received the same reply from you in triplicate, Karen?

Enclosed is a replacement for /send which supports -T<type>.  I think a
few people have been asking for it.  There is also a /get_world_info
macro which lets you get character, password, etc on non-foreground
worlds.  I'd like to see that as a function world_info("cave","host")
at some point.

Hello!

I'v been using tf for quite some time, but I have always been anoyed at
the somewhat
limited support for color in tf. For example I whould like to be able to
use more then
one color in a /echo statement. Also I'd like to be able to make a
highlighting with more
then one attribute to. This is not so hard, just needs a new way of
doing this things.

I fiddled some with a client of my own a while back, and implemented the
same color
codes syntax in my client as I did in our mud. It's simple and yet
powerful. To give you
some Idea of what I'm getting at I'll try to give you some examples...

the color codes are made up of some basic elements, first all
colorizations start with a
"&" followd by the action to be done. I will make a list down of how I
aranged em...

&+   will change FG color.
&-    will change BG color.
&=    will change them bouth.
&#    will sett bold.
&_    will set Underline.
&n    will turn off colorization.

The Colors is a letter:
Capital Letter is HighIntensity in FG, or Blinking in BG.

r or R    Red
g or G    Green
b or B    Blue
y or Y    Yellow
m or M    Magenta
c or C    Cyan
w or W    White
l or L    Black

So an example whould look like this:

&+R  HighintensityRed &n
&-b  BlueBG &n
&+rb RedOnBlue &n
&+C&_ UnderlinedHighintensityCyan &n

This can then be inserted anyware, and is interpreted by the client be4
it's sent to the display. We have been using this system in our Mud for
over a year and it seems to be
a rather good implementation, It's flexible, and powerful.

Just an idea, I like to have in ths system. It's much much easier then
the -a options that
tf uses today. And it's heck of a lot more powerful.

If this was implemented we could do things like
/echo - &+RWARNING&n: &+WThis is just a Wanding...&n

My 2 cents worth...

/Bjrn

PS.
Hawkeye:
if you'd like my C code for this I'd be happy to send it, it's somewhat
stand alone :)
DS.

 I have a problem concerning grabbing and recalling. What I want to do is
grab all text containing [pattern] and then later recall the last 10 lines
containing this pattern. Anyone have any good solutions ready I could
use? :)

Hi,
How would I go about making a shortcut for thing like:

Order followers kill mob, where mob is a variable
for example I want to type:
ofk citizen
and what is sent to the mud will be:
order followers kill citizen

Is that possible?
TIA

How can you stack multiple commands on one line to be entered.
I know its posible with macro's, but. what about direct entered stuff.

ie.... the ability to do something like this

kill blah%;fight blah%;engage stuff%;
?

thanks.

Not without making a "macro" (send hook) to /eval everything you type
before sending it on ...
/def -h"SEND *" catch_and_eval = /eval /send %*
  else try doing:
/eval kill blah%;fight blah%;engage stuff
  or if you're really lazy,
/def -i e=/eval %*
  then:
/e kill foo%;fight bar%;engage others

It's still possible to do it without any macro, just escape the % like:

kill blah\%;fight blah\%;engage stuff

I do it now and then :)

Yeah, thats the right one, but to make tf recognize the command, you must first
type a '/send' so tf will execute:

/send kill blah %; fight blah %; engage stuff 

thats it ;-)

I'm almost sure there is a setting you may change so the command line 
will accept lines as above.

The only way to input multiple commands is to use the %; delimiter; this gets
nasty/annoying because u have to reach with shift-key to the 5 key every
time you want to do this.
Here is some tf code i wrote to handle mutliple commands inputted at once,
using the comma as a delimiter, and the ] and > keys as the commands
trigger:

/alias ] /do_expand %{*}
/alias > /eval /do_expand %%{$[strcat("dir_",%{1})]}%;\
    /if ($[strlen(%{-1})]) /eval ] %{-1} %; /endif

/def -i do_expand = \
        /let temp_str=%{*} %;\
        /let commloc=$[strchr(temp_str,",")] %;\
        /while ( commloc > -1 )\

so usage would be:

the > functionality is for move macros, you have to set these before hand,
like:

/set dir_temple s,e,n,w

also you can use the move macros bundled with commands at the end:

this may or may not prove useful to you; i do welcome and critiques on the
code and suggestions as to how i can make it faster...

Wow. Some very good code. I will surely test it.
But i have tested some alternative way that also does its work.
Try to type the following:

/repeat -1 1 say hi %; say ho %; kill friend %; eat friend 

I don't mean, it is better than your idea, i only wanted to show up another way
to do that ;-)

Bye
  Freddy

There have been a lot of bad answers (and a few good ones) on this topic,
so I'll sort them out.

The short answer is /set sub=on or /set sub=full before typing a that line,
or put "/eval" at the beginning of that line.

This works, but "/set sub=full" has the same effect.

That's backwards.  If you had sub=on, then those "\"s would escape the
meaning of "%;" and make it literal.

/send is irrelevant.  You still need to set %sub or use /eval.

This is not a bad idea, if you find "," more convenient than "%;".
But the implementation can be improved:

> /alias > /eval /do_expand %%{$[strcat("dir_",%{1})]}%;\
That $[...] expansion works, and would be needed for more complicated
expressions, but simple concatenation can be done with normal body expansion.
(Your use of /eval is correct, though).
>     /if ($[strlen(%{-1})]) /eval ] %{-1} %; /endif
There's no need for $[] inside () of an /if condition.
Inside an expression, {n} is better than %{n}.
Instead of using "/eval ] ...", just call /do_expand directly.

Improved version:

/alias > /eval /do_expand %%{dir_%{1}}%;\
    /if (strlen({-1})) /do_expand %{-1} %; /endif

> /def -i do_expand = \
>         /let temp_str=%{*} %;\
>         /let commloc=$[strchr(temp_str,",")] %;\
>         /while ( commloc > -1 )\
>                 /let prev=$[substr(temp_str, 0, commloc)]%;\
>                 /let rest=$[substr(temp_str, $[commloc+1])]%;\
There's no need to nest $[] inside $[].  (If you're unsure about grouping,
use (...), not $[...].)
>                 /let temp_str=$[strcat(prev,"%;",rest)] %;\
You don't need to stick them back together; just execute the stuff to the left
of the comma, and forget it.  Also, by concatenating them, you unnecessarily
re-scan the left side with each iteration.
>                 /let commloc=$[strchr(temp_str,",")] %;\
This duplicates code from line 3.  It can be moved into the /while condition
to avoid duplication.
>         /done %;\
>         /eval %{temp_str}

Improved version:

/def do_expand = \
    /let args=%*%; \
    /let i=0%; \
    /while ((i:=strchr(args, ",")) >= 0) \
        /eval $[substr(args, 0, i)]%; \
        /let args=$[substr(args, i+1)]%; \
    /done%; \
    /eval %args

Try to give these gags high priority. At least my logfiles changed quite

Hi,

It's been a while, but I did not find an answer to this question, so I

I am using the following hooks:

    /repeat -00:00:05 1 /connect Danaya
/def -p1 -wDanaya -h'DISCONNECT' hook_disconnect_danaya = \

Well gang, I am in the midst of working on a port of TF to a new PowerPC based OS called the BeOS.  It runs on existing PowerMacs and CHRP machines and will soon be running on Intel hardware.

I do have a real simple question though.  Ken, I understand that you were working on a CygWin port of TF but I now understand taht you are alo working on a 3.6 version.  If this is the case, are you making any changes that would effect the CygWin codebase?  Reason being is that the BeOS and the CygWin implementaion share a similar bug, weak select() support.  I can work around it if need be but if you are making some changes I would be willing to wait until September for the 3.6 alpha to get the port underway, otherwise I'm going to start hacking around the sekect() bug this weekend..

Thanks in Advance

Andy

I think this fellow was looking for something that will allow him to do:

/connect X
--- Connected to X ---
/connect X
--- Connected to X1 ---
/connect X
--- Connected to X2 ---

etc... That is "allow reconnection to a world definition". You want to be
able to connect many times to the same MUD... This is something I miss in
TF, and is something that shouldn't be hard to do int the code. Please, Ken?
Also, being able to silence connect (-q or -s) so it will shut up when you
fail to connect (maybe because you already have a connection), so you could
use that in a test.
:-)

For now, I implemented a little command called /new that will connect to
a world just as in my example above, except with /new instead of /connect.
Maybe that will help the guy, if your suggestion wasn't correct. :-)

Have to say I don't see an easy way to do this...

UNIX system passwords work in a "nobody can decrypt" because you've
always got the encryupted password to compare an encrypted version of
the typed in password to.

However, with TF, we need the plaintext, meaning that the means to 
decrypt must be in the system someplace.  That's a trivial crack,
in such a situation, unless you use something really strong like
RSA/etc.  And that'd mean typing in a password every time you start
TF, something that's easily snoopable by root.

Of course, I'm presuming you're concerned about getting rid of the
superuser's ability to snoop your passwords (if it's readonly to you,
then they're the only one to worry about).  Hell, even if the password
is encrypted with something strong, the root user could still dump
the start of any outbound TCP connection to port 4201 remote.  Name,
password, thanks kindly. :)

Cygwin b18 actually has fairly good select() support, but I have made other
changes and fixes in main_loop(), so I suggest waiting.

Guys... 

	 THis isnt all that difficult.. I mean talk about putting the cart
before the horse...

all you *have* to do is type:

	 /eval /send kill stuff%;eat crap%;drink worse

I mean how many times do you really want to concatinate commands outside
of a script. or if you do 5 things to go to sleep just create an alias
commnad with little code.. I am just saying that whoever is using this
should understand  it.. so make it simple..

	/def sleep=\
		/eval /send eat food%;drink water%;say goodnight%;chat %*


	USAGE:
		/sleep Goodnight Johnboy

I dunno.. just seems easier.. :)

Your everpresent ball-buster,
- Scott Benjamin

Many on this list have probably been in IRC sometimes. Nearly every
client has somekind of a "tabkey" function to get nick's last messaged
to etc. I want this kind of behavior to tinyfugue also.

I started making it myself but I didn't find a good way to implement
arrays in tinyfugue. I got it working such that I have one string which
it rotates like this:

Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee
<tab key>
Bb Cc Dd Ee Aa

and prints the first element. The problem is that you should always add
new names to the beginning of the original not rolled array.

Well anyways, if somebody would look up an example from ircII
(irc-client) libraries... it's in file "tabkey" and port it into
tinyfugue.

The actual trigger to add names is trivial, but I'm playing mainly in
LPMud so you can include that if you want to =)

isn't tab the 'more' key? you'd have to use spc-page.tf to change it to a
different key...

lisp.tf and stack-q.tf have a bunch of useful commands for handling lists.

I don't IRC, so I have no idea what you're talking about.

Suggestion:  store the list of names in a variable, in reverse, and
store an index in another variable.  Use something like

    /def nextname = \
        /nth $[--index] %list%; \
        /if (!index) /set index=$(/length %list)

to get the next name from the list and move the index.  Add new names
to the end of the list (because the list is stored in reverse, you add
to the end, and you don't need to adjust the index when you add a name).

The idea is that pressing by pressing the tab key (something else in tf)
you can do a tell (or a page) to the last person that telled (paged) you
something. By pressing tab again you get the second last person that
telled you.

The Man is a Genius! Well I don't wonder... he did the damn client =)

The thing he didn't know was that I want to adjust the index when I add
a new name. The "tab" key is supposed to bring the last teller if a new
tell comes so I want tot jump the index.

My code so far:

/def tk_getname = \

        /nth $[tk_index] %tk_list%;\

        /if
(!--tk_index) /set tk_index=$(/length %tk_list)%; /endif



/def
tk_addname = \

        /set tk_list=%tk_list %{*}%; \

        /set
tk_index=$(/length %tk_list)


Now I need to improve the addname function. It needs to have a max size
(about 10 or 20 names) and if a name already appears on the list I wan't
it to be moved to the end of the list. No duplicates allowed case
shouldn't matter.

By the time I get this a reply to this I have already solved the
problem, but I'd like to see an elegant solution =)

This list is wonderful.

I'll try to explain, so others can give him suggestions. In the irc 
client I use, for example, if I start a dcc chat, which is similar 
in purpose to the common "page" command of muds, or if I accept a dcc 
chat from someone else, the TAB key will enter "/msg <nick> " 
automatically in the command line.

I suppose that's what he wants (very easy, indeed, but I'm out of 
time right now).

Define the macro with -b9, I suspect.

This works as far as I could test it. The tk_addname part needs to be
make better, namely a maximum of 20 elements or so and a better remove.

hi all,

  Can someone help me with the following. If I type 'aff' in my mud I
get a list of spells. Just like below.

+ Spell: 'detect hidden' modifies NONE by 0 for 42 hours
+ Spell: 'detect magic' modifies NONE by 0 for 42 hours
+ Spell: 'detect sneak' modifies NONE by 0 for 42 hours
+ Spell: 'giant strength' modifies STR by 3 for 18 hours
+ Spell: 'fly' modifies NONE by 0 for 5 hours
+ Spell: 'armor' modifies AC by -20 for 12 hours

What I want is that when I type a predefined alias like "status" I want myself
say in highlight or bold the following: "say fly: 5 hours, armor: 12 hours
and giant strength: 18 hours". I was wondering if it was possible to
capture several lines and throw it out back in a line. Also I don't want
it trigger when I type aff, but only when I type status


thx for helping.

Sauw-Yuh

hi all,

  I got another question. I have been trying to construct a counter for
my xp and gold. But no success. This is the text I get after each kill.

An alley cat is DEAD!! R.I.P.
You receive 7 experience points.
An alley cat's arm is sliced from his dead body.
You get some gold from corpse of an alley cat.
There were 30 coins.

thx

When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman. After school we'd
all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he would eat one of us.
It wasn't until later that I found out that Uncle Caveman was a bear.

Ok... I was tired one time of spelling me up with two dozen armor spells
one time, so I wrote a little script to do it for me. First, it creates
a bunch of variables and initializes them to 0. Then, it sets up a bunch
of triggers to set the variables to 1 if I'm affected by a spell, and
then it casts the missing spells, at last it unsets the vars, undefs the
triggers. You could use a similar thingie. Because tf has no way of
knowing it should wait with casting the spells until the 'affect' list
is completed, you should tell yourself something after the affect and
trigger on that message. Of course, this script does not solve your
problem right away, but it's a start you can work with.

The above was presented to me as macro that would send the message '@@' to
any and all sites I was connected to that were in the background, every 6
minutes. However, when I implemented it and checked it, it did not work. 

I appreciate the assistance of the person who originally worked this out
for me, and I thought maybe someone on the list would suggest repairs???

Hey there.

I've got this problem: on some computers when I get some text in a
different color, the foreground color will change to this, instead of
switching back to normal.  I'm not sure if this is tf, or the terminal
I'm using to connect to my shell.  Though to make the problem even
more difficult, I can use the same term program to connect, same
settings, and it'll work fine on my home pc.  

Any ideas?

I have a some similar problems. My problem is that I can't get a decent
termcap anywhere. I need WORKING terms: linux, vt100 (or vt102), vt220,
xterm, screen. In every termcap there's some problems with the subject.
Linux term normally doesn't have colors in most of the terms. Neither
xterm has colors. xterm-color is very broken and should not be used.
Screen and cursor keys don't work and some screen termcap's don't handle
color. Linux termcap doesn't map Fkeys 10-12 and End key. I have piled
together a nearly working termcap from numerous termcaps. For Example
the Linux Redhat distribution has a termcap in which there is no reverse
video what so ever in the Linux-console term.

The color problem is probably from an erroneus termcap entry for your
term or a wrong TERM variable for your terminal program.

How/why this ended up on the tf list is a mystery, and it's kinda off
topic, but "xterm +cm -fg white -bg black" will start xterm in color mode.
Then you should use TERM = "xterm-color", and that should work just fine.

Termcap entry:

xterm-color|xterm-co|xterm with ANSI colors:\
        :pa#64:Co#8:Sf=\E[3%dm:Sb=\E[4%dm:op=\E[m:tc=xterm:

Good luck...

I think it's relevant because I have some more problem's with tf
and colors too and this matter has to be settled first.

Anyways I have my xresources set correctly so I need no commandline
switches to xterm.

This termcap entry has numerous problems

The Sb and Sf entry's have a little different meaning it seems and there
is no definition of AB or AF anywhere. For example "screen" does not
think
a terminal has colors unless it has those AB and AF entry's. I'm not
sure
but I think the NC entry is required also.

Most screenrcs contain a kludge because of broken termcap's to add those

definitions
termcap  xterm 'AF=\E[3%dm:AB=\E[4%dm'
terminfo xterm 'AF=\E[3%p1%dm:AB=\E[4%p1%dm'

Okay, here is something that i would find really useful for TF:

How often did you fall off a cliff, b/c you hadn't noticed your fly ran
out? How often have you been wondering if your paladin had his ability
to lay hands restored? It's so easy to miss a crucial message even if
it's hilited, so I thought it would be helpful to display flags as part
of the status line.

Example:

/def -ag -t'You rise up off the ground.'     xfly = /xset 0 F 
/def -ag -t'You sink gently to the ground.' rxfly = /xset 0 _

The first line would display an F at position 0 in the status line,
whereas the second would reset it to _ again, so one could see at one
glance whether the character is flying or not.

I have implemented it in a quick & dirty way *) into my TF and it works
great. It is so much easier to keep track of my magical protections etc.

Well, maybe if others like that idea too, we can convince Ken to
officially implement it. ;-)

Cheers
  Robert

--
*) I effectively overwrite the -more- space on the status line, b/c I
don't use more anyway.

Hi everybody,

I was wondering if anyone out there has solved the problem of
selectively disabling/enabling triggers. I know i can use /borg to
dis/enable all of them and that i can /undef them by name, however
i want to be able to quickly re-enable them without typing the whole
thing in. To illustrate it, a short example.


/def -t'A pile of coins lies here' get_coins = get all.coins

<arrive at area where you don't want to pick up coins>

/disable get_coins

<walk past the coins you don't want to pick up>

/enable get_coins

<now pick up all coins again>


Perhaps it could be done by setting the probability to 0 and restoring
it, or specify some dummy world for the trigger, or....

I believe Ken said we would have access to some portion of the status line in

This is just an update on the status of the TF for BeOS port.

As it stands right now, it works, albeit poorly.  I am still fixing things like Visual support and TERMCAP support, both of which the BeOS can do but at the moment store in very strange places.  This port is currently based upon the 35b4 code, and when 40a1 makes it's appearance I will update it into the mainline distribution if Ken approves my methods.  

No release date has been set, and I will most likely hold the close to the vest until Be ships PR2.

Tinyfugue 3.6 has a user configurable statusline. I think Ken Keys
mentioned
it on the list somewhere. Well I'll let him specify it if he feel the
need.

Anyways I would like to know your quick & dirty way of doing it.
I put the spell effects in variables and then use the PROMPT hook to
display
my own prompt instead of the mud-prompt (ofcourse only when it's the
default
mudprompt). I would also like to hear other solutions to this.

either:
	/edit -c0 get_coins
or:
	make a really complex macro called /disable that takes
	as a parameter another macro name which it then /edit -c0 's.
or:
	make a /disable_get_coins macro that does /edit -c0 get_coins

see above, but change all /edit -c0 to /edit -c100

Note that /edit clears -i ... do /help edit

This is foolish.  Why not just write /disable to set a flag, and have get_coins
check the value of that flag before proceeding?

Or define a trigger (matching the same text) of a higher priority, and not -F?

The first suggestion requires that each of those macros become more
complicated, by requiring them to check the flag.  The original poster
had the right, simple idea IMHO, to simply reduce the chance of the
trigger going off to 0.

The second suggestion requires more work than is necessary, as well.
Either you type more each type you want to change the behavior (/def
... then /undef or equivalent), or you end up editing that
higher-priority macro's chance.  Having more triggers nominally slows
down tf, as well.

ok, here is what was called a more complicated macro:
first define some variables:

/set autoloot=0

then define a key so you can switch the autoloot variable. lets say the
Ctrl-X key :)

; Keybind to alter autoloot option
/def -b'^X' = /if (autoloot == 0)\
                        /echo -ah Greedy character activated.%;\
                        /set autoloot=1 %;\
                     /else \
                        /echo -ah Autoloot disabled.%;\
                        /set autoloot=0 %;\
                     /endif

Now write a simple if structure around your old trigger.

/def -t'A pile of coins lies here' get_coins = \
  /if (autoloot == 1)\
    get all.coins%;\
  /endif

That's it:)
Have fun.
Sven

I have this problem with ANSI colors and my prompt. When the %{lp} is
on, any unterminated line will be interpreted as prompt after a little
while. Normally when I get input from the mud things go fine:
(%emulation=debug)

hp: sp: ep: >
Sprite tells you '*hugs*.'^M
You tell sprite '*hugs* =).'^M

But when the mud send me ANSI colored info:

Tomppa leaves east.^M
^[[1;33mSprite [ghost]: and cooking dinner.^M
^[[0m

Tinyfugue thinks "^[[0m" is the prompt because it _is_ an unterminated
line received from the world. Effectively I get text from the mud and
the prompt get's redisplayed properly until a colored line is received
from the mud. Then the prompt is that all-attributes-off string and it
ofcourse doesn't show at all.

I have developed a kludge to circumvent this, but I would like to know
if this behavior is corrected in TF4.0 or will it be?

I read his email and it's exactly how I'd like it done. I can't wait to get 
my hand on that version.

Hm, I hacked the TF source code and introduced a new special variable that is
displayed as part of the status line. But since there is a much better 
implementation I better don't say anything more specific.

That's how I first did it, but the prompt gets very long with some monster 
names, so it is not really feasible.

BINGO: that is exactly what I was looking for. ;-)

Anyone got such a beast?

I wanted to avoid the need to have enable/disable for every trigger that I might
ever want to disable.

Thanks for all the other tips, although they were not exactly what I wanted, as
they either introduce complexity into my main macros (the flag approach) or
make enable/disable specific to one macro only.

How about something along the lines of (untested):

/def -i disable = \
  /edit -c0 -i %{1}

/def -i enable = \
  /edit -c100 -i %{i}

(I always like to make as many macros -i as I can, to clean up /list).
The macros assume that the name you pass it exists; if it doesn't,
then /edit will complain.  You could, of course, make those macros
more bulletproof (check that they pass in exactly one parameter, that
the macro they name exists, etc) -- easy enough.

I really think you should take this up with the MUD admins and make them
fix their code, instead. They should be sending "^[[0m^M^J" instead of
"^M^J^[[0m" at the end of each colored line. It'll look nicer on weird
terminals too, since some terminals "bleed" otherwise.

Ideally tf would handle every goofy thing a server throws at it, but
Mikael's right, the server really should send the code at the end of
the line, not the beginning of the next line.

TF 4.0 will not handle this any differently.

This is an age old problem for us MU(SH|X)ers.  But I'm sure other 
systems cause problems with this too.  I need to find a way to strip 
whitespace from a file so that I can /quote it to a single line.

For example:
	@pemit ##=You grab the bird.;
	@move #xx=##;
	@emit loc(##)=name(##) grabs the bird.

Would be turned into:
@pemit ##=You grab the bird.;@move #xx=##;@emit loc(##)=name(##) grabs the bird.

It would be particularly useful if I could do it in TF so that I could 
even page someone a copy of say a mail message (again, turning multiple 
lines into a single line of input).

One obvious problem to consider... some spaces you want to disappear, and 
other spaces you want to stick around... like @pemitSPACE##=blah

Thanks in advance for any ideas.

Assuming that the lines in the file really start at @ and end at the ; or .
(IOW, have no leading or trailing whitespace), you can do /quote /input
'<filename> to place multiple lines in your input buffer as a single line.

Even if there is leading and trailing whitespace, I don't see a problem (other
than with the whitespace in front of the first @) since every MUSH/MUX/MUSE
parser I know of will strip out the whitespace whether you want it to or not.

How do you use /input to strip the newline/return characters and spaces?

Interestly enough Mark, my experience is precisely the opposite.  I've 
never seen a single MU(SH|X) system that will allow multi-line input of 
code.  Basically command input has to be in the form:

&prop_name object=$command_name [args]:continuous string of actions 

If my program has multiple lines, it doesn't work.  I've gone to 
MU(SH|X)es all over the place and other than the TF-fake property 
editor, noone has a way to edit programs.  (like the MUF editor in MUCK, 
or program editor in MOO).

I may have used 'whitespace' incorrectly there.

To the MU* parser the line:
@pemit %#=Hello          World 

is the same as
@pemit %#=Hello World

Using @set the spaces in the first example are reduced to a single 
space.

In any event, you can use /quote /input as I suggested earlier.  The parser
views internal space between a semi-colon and a at-sign or ampersand as
meaningless and dumps it.  As I said, the only problem might be in leading
space before the first at-sign or ampersand.

Well, I've not got a tf I can use to test at the moment, but I believe you'd do
 it the same way you do when you cut'n'paste to the input window...use ctrl-t 
 and delete to next word the spaces and newlines, or delete the newlines by
 themselves manually.

Hey, you asked. :)

Offhand, I'd believe the problem is that Mark didn't quite see that you wanted
 to consider newline-type characters as whitespace; I'm sure you'll agree that
 MUSH and MUX tend to crunch spaces and ignore tabs, and that's probably all
 that Mark was considering as 'whitespace'.

Well, there's always FugueEdit to pull one attribute into your input line, but 
 that's not what you want, right? :)

So, lemme see if *I* understand. You want to write your MUSHcode in a visually
 appealing, structured format, but then be able to /quote it up without doing 
 anything to it yourself. Yes?

If so, the tool that might help is Andrew Molitor's unformatter, which does 
 just that. I'm sure the more ambitious of you out there that DO have tf in a
 runnable, accessable format, can come up with a /def to do a /quote and run
 the 'unformat' program on the input file, and send the result to the MU*...
 Um, mebbe /def unformat_quote = /quote !unformat <$1....feel free to correct 
 and fix... :)

Oh, where to get it? Well, a quick search finds an interesting page with it at
 http://lost.strange.com/mushcode/ which assumes tinyfugue without even making
 the reference to tf a link...looks like a mushcode archive derived from other
 archives, like the old one at caisr2.caisr.cwru.edu that moved here and there,
 was at chaco.com for a while, but I'm not sure WHERE it is right now...but I'm
 sure that Amby has a reference to it at http://www.godlike.com/muds/mres/mftp.html

Well, that's enough...took me over a half hour to write this...sheesh....

Well, I'd suggest checking out any of the MU[X|SH] code unformatters presently 
available (I know of at least 3, one of which is mine, unsupported, and not 
overly user-friendly) as a place to start, then developing a TF macro that 
runs a that program as a shell macro:

/def code = /IF ({#} >= 2) \
	/quote -dsend -w -1 !mpp %{-1} <%{1} %; \
	/ELSE /quote -dsend -w -1 !mpp < %{0} %; \
	/ENDIF

For quoting files, I have a (less pretty) macro (following) that works thus:

/sysquote page pooterbeast=,cat myfile

Generalized, that's:

/sysquote <MU* command>,<system command>

/def sysquote = /test regmatch('(,)',{0}) %; \
	/quote -dsend -w %PL ! %PR | \
		perl -pe 's/\%/\%\%/g; s/\\n/\%r/g ; s/\\s/\%b/g ; '

As far as something that will just arbitrarily munch newlines, you could 
do:

/def crunchlines = /quote -dsend -w ! %{0} | perl -pe 's/\\n//;' 

and then 

/crunchlines cat myfile

or, generalized

/crunchlines <system command>

I have a couple questions, at least one of which I've asked in the past 
w/o response.

First, a problem with triggers.

Texts from the MUD:
 A - "Macom pales, and sags."
 B - "A HUGE red demon pales, and sags."

Triggers:
 1 - /def -t'* pales, and sags.' enfeeb1=gsay %1 has been enfeebled!
 2 - /def -t'{*} pales, and sags.' enfeeb2=gsay %1 has been enfeebled!


Text A or B with trigger 1:
 It loops, and does this:

SoInSo group-says "Macom has been enfeebled!"
SoInSo group-says "SoInSo group-says "Macom has been enfeebled" Macom has 
been enfeebled!"

And continues to recurse.

So I tried trigger 2.

With text A, it is triggered properly.  Text B never triggers it.  What 
am I doing wrong, in both cases?
(sorry if my method of explaining this was confusing, but I figured it 
would work best)


Question 2:

  Under OS/2, Tinyfugue's "ansi_attr" emulation seems to have problems.  
Bold color text is displayed with an orange background.  Also, if I set 
emulation to raw (so OS/2 takes care of it, properly) none of my triggers 
work.  It appears that it doesn't filter out the ansi codes for trigger 
evaluation.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Brad Hartin

To be pedantic:

This is the case if the MUSH is running with the "space_compress" option
set to "yes". While this is the default (and some major code packages rely
on this setting, unfortunately...) it is not, technically, a requirement.

Looking over all of the stuff that's been posted, I have to consider whether
anyone has written a TF-macro that does the job of Andrew Molitor's (sp?)
unformatting parser... (it's origionalling in C, but I've seen sed and perl
variants, and I wrote a more robust version of it known as "munf"). Much
of the "distribution" code is in a format that these handle; what isn't is
usually arranged to be /quoted directly in.

Example: (note that _ is used to denote whitespace)

# This is a comment

__@pemit %#=Foo!__
@pemit %#=Bar!
-

Turns into:

@pemit %#=Foo!__@pemit %#=Bar!<newline>

Anyone written a TF macro for it? Or do I even want to think about this? :P

Hi,

I had a lot of crashes of tf now. I know that I demand a lot of my client,
in fact I nearly programmed a robot, so I'm not too surprised, still I would
like to tell you where the problem is so you can fix it.
But - as the client crashes during execution of a macro which, at least I
believe so, is executed a lot of times before without crash, things are 
not so easy.
Once tinyfugue said something about "not enough memory" or "allocation of
memory failed" (I had to reconnect as I was in a hard fight, so I could
not save it), the rest of error messages just is indifferent,
Segmentation Faults ...  (I'm using 3.5 beta 4 on a solaris system now, 
3.5 alpha 20 had no problems, but since then my code grew.)

So I'm looking for a method to find out what exactly happened in the client
when the crash came. Is there a way to log every command as it is sent
to the MUD? Or to notify every execution of any macro in the logfile?
I don't want them to spam my screen though ...

Any help appreciated,

    Susan Dittmar

Try running with /mecho on, which should give an indication of what's going
on.  If you can get a coredump out of the deal, follow the instructions
included with TF to get some useable data out of the crash, and send that to
Mr. Keys.

Two bugs I know are being fixed in 4.0 (that I've expereienced, and had to
patch TF in the meantime) are misworlding if activity occurs at the exact
time you hit return, and crashing on "tcgetattr".  (A select() problem I think).

Is it possible to /mecho only to the logfile? If it's written to the
screen I will be spammed totally, no chance to play any more, and the
crashes occur after quite a while of playing usually. I really use
a lot of triggers and stuff ;-)

How about turning on /log, and gagging mecho output (not -aG, just -ag, so
the lines still get to the log).

FWIW, even though this looks like two differenty types of errors, they're
most likely connected to the same problem.  If tf is unable to allocate
additional memory, it's very possible for a seg fault to show up shortly
afterwards, depending on the internals of tf.

There could be lots of reasons why tf was unable to allocate memory, but
it sounds like your system was running a bit low, or you were hitting a
user limit.  That could be caused by any number of things as well... perhaps
you had a run-away macro, or maybe a memory leak in tf... or maybe the 
system just had jillions of other things running on it, consuming all
available ram...

Just some thoughts...

Is there a relatively simple way to make tf always prepend
line numbers to output from a world the way it does when
you do recall using the # symbol?

I've got a macro that helps me quote previous lines to
the world I'm in using these numbers, but I need to
be able to see them for them to really be useful :)

Is the fix for misworlding easy to apply?  I'm having this too, but when I
reported it here, I thought it was being dismissed as something I had done wrong
with triggers...

According to Susan Dittmar:

My guess is, if you have seen "out of memory error"s, you're low on memory,
when having run TF for a while. This can result in segmentation faults, if
the program (TF in this case) doing the allocation neglects to check the
returned memory to be valid (check for NULL return). I'd guess TF is in
better shape then not to check, so my guess is that it's Solaris which
has a problem. See, Solaris can return a pointer to memory that is not
actually allocated for you, and that will be allocated when you use it.
This is fine, in the normal case. If, however, solaris suddenly runs out
of swap and memory, it might fail to allocate the memory when your program
accesses it's legally aquired memory, and the program will get a
Segmentation Violation. IF this is your problem, then basically there's
nothing Ken can do. You have to get more swap for your poor Slowlaris
machine.

Disclaimer: I'm not 100% sure about the about statements, but I think so.

Good afternoon,
	Is there any way to loop over lists of strings in a manner
similar to sh's for construct?  I basically want something like:

/set this="foo bar baz"
/for i in %this %; \
;;; "/foreach i %this" would be an acceptable form too ...
	/eval tell %i Shutting down in 5 minutes %; \
/done

The above of course, doesn't work...  I can cobble together something
that works, but not in a general way:

/eval /set list="some stuff obtained from a set of macros ..."
/eval /set listl=$(/length %list)
/while (listl > 0) %; \
	/eval /set name=$(/car %list) %; \
	/eval /set list=$(/cdr %list) %; \
	/eval ptell %name Shutting down in 5 minutes %; \
	/eval /set listl=$(/length %list) %; \
/done

This has the desired effect, but is an awful lot to type by hand, and
not general enough to be useful to put into a macro file...

Any ideas?

Thanks,
	_Adam

Here are two examples of ways to do that, the second is prob more pertinent,
but the second is built on the first:

(1)
/alias ] /do_expand %{*}
/alias > /eval /do_expand %%{dir_%{1}}%;\
    /if (strlen({-1})) /do_expand %{-1} %; /endif

/def do_expand = \
    /let args=%*%; \
    /let i=0%; \
    /while ((i:=strchr(args, ",")) >= 0) \
        /eval $[substr(args, 0, i)]%; \
        /let args=$[substr(args, i+1)]%; \
    /done%; \
    /eval %args

/set dir_warlock > adv,e,war,temple

This first set of aliases and triggers basically allows me to separate
things by commas and have them evaluated in order.
example:
] s,e,n,look,score
sends s, then e, then n, then look, and finally score
the '>' alias is something i set up for move macros
example:
> warlock
this runs through the commands in the dir_warlock variable. notice the
stacked '>' in the example.

(2)
; /rep_comm command @:array

/def -i rep_comm =\
        /let rc_orig=%{*} %;\
        /let rc_temp1=0 %;\
        /let rc_temp2=0 %;\
        /let rc_temp3=0 %;\
        /let rc_temp4=0 %;\
        /let rc_loc=$[strchr(rc_orig,":")] %;\
        /let rc_temp1=$[substr(rc_orig, 0, rc_loc)] %;\
        /let rc_temp2=$[substr(rc_orig, $[rc_loc+1])] %;\
        /let rc_loc=$[strchr(rc_temp1,"@")] %;\
        /let rc_temp3=$[substr(rc_temp1, 0, rc_loc)] %;\
        /let rc_temp4=$[substr(rc_temp1, $[rc_loc+1])] %;\
        /let rc_loc=0 %;\
        /while ( rc_loc > -1 )\
            /let rc_loc=$[strchr(rc_temp2,"#")] %;\
            /let prev=$[substr(rc_temp2, 0, rc_loc)]%;\
            /let rc_temp2=$[substr(rc_temp2, $[rc_loc+1])]%;\
            /let rc_new=$[strcat(rc_new,rc_temp3,' ',prev,rc_temp4,"%;")] %;\
            /let rc_loc=$[strchr(rc_temp2,"#")] %;\
        /done %;\
        /eval %{rc_new}


/set chest1_eq boots#leggings#sucker#staff#ring#ring#amulet#belt#

/alias get_eq /rep_comm /send !open @:%{wc1} %;\
        /rep_comm /send !get @ from modis:%{chest1_eq} %;\
        /rep_comm /send !get @ from modis2:%{chest2_eq} %;\
        /send !wield staff %; /send !lwield sickle %; /send !wear all %;\
        /rep_comm /send !close @:%{wc1} %;\
        /send !save %; /send !castle check %;\
        /send !recovery_test %; /send !ll

This second example is something i wrote in a similar vein to above, but to
get equipment from chests on a mud i play (zombie). You set a list of items
to go through delimited by '#', and then set up a /rep_comm, where the
delimited items replace the '@' in the command.
example:
/set folks foo#bar#baz
/rep_comm /send tell @ Shutting down in 5 minutes:%{folks}

I havent had any problems with either of these so far (and thanks to Ken
for the streamlining of the first).

The easiest fix is:

/def -b'^j' = /dokey newline
/def -b'^m' = /dokey newline


More complicated and not any more useful C code fixes available on
CaveMUCK or DruidMUCK.

It's highly unlikely that you demand more of your tf than some of the
rest of us.  Mine's currently at 142M (about 100M due to memory leak
which is now fixed), been up 60days, macro counter above 145000, etc.

Sounds like you are running out of memory, this can happen at any time.
Check your resource limits with the `limit' command in your shell.
Raise your datasize, stacksize, and vmemory limits.

Do you use a lot of /quote -S or /repeat -S forms?

Also, since you are running on solaris, you may experience a bug where
you lose the ability to send any input or you get a tgetattr error and
an exit.  This can be fixed by a 2 line patch.

I recommend just looking at the core file with a debugger like gdb, the
`where' command will show you exactly what was running as arguments.

I have been having some problems with color in TF.

First I have 2 connections running, one is always in the background, (its a
server of sorts for the foreground mud).  I am trying to use ansi color on my
server, but I cant get it to display the color in the foreground.  I use /echo
to display the text taht comes from the server to the foreground.  Ive noticed
that just about everything strips color codes when I am in ansi_attr emulation.
I know it would be possible to have it work in raw emulation mode, but I have
a ton of triggers in my foreground world that I would have to rewrite, and
putting ansi codes in them is not pretty.  So do you guys have any ideas on
getting ansi color to show through from a background world to a foreground
world with emulation on ansi_attr?

2nd I remember a topic being discussed about putting color in a prompt, could
someone pull that from their archive or tell me how they ended up doing it?
Oh, I also remember a fifo script being posted, could someone also post that?

Thanks alot,
Lightn

My TF hangs if I hit a CTRL-<something> that is not defined. CTRL-P works fine,
CTRL-O hangs the program. On my keyboard, O and P are rather close. Other
erronous typing of mine has revealed that most CTRL-<X> gives the same 
behaviour.

My TF is:

Anyone has a patch, or know what goes wrong?

Using the same binary on the same computer I can contribute a bit I
hope.

It can be shown that THIS tf does even crash while there is plenty (>
200M) memory/swap aviable. It does crash on a macro, after some time.
All the other times said macro[1] does not crash.

Basically this is true IIRC and the rough outline what happens in
about every UNIX that supports such nice features as copy-on-write,
where a memory page used for a fork is not changed unless the forked
child changes it. Without such things we'd need much more memory.

However, this is not the reason for THESE crashes.

same here, but me thinks we think the same.

[1] Said macro(s) are used a lot and thus get more chances to crash:

/def recast_prep = \
        /set am_prot=0 %;\
        /set am_armored=0 %;\
        /def -mglob -ag -p100 -t'Spell: armor          : *' recast_test_arm = \
                /set am_prot=1 %%;\
                /set am_armored=1 %;\
        /def -mglob -ag -p100 -t'Spell: natures protection: *' recast_test_prot = \
                /set am_prot=1 %;\
[a lot of the same stuff for other lines ]
        /def -mregexp -ag -p100 -t'^                      : [-a-z0-9]+ for [0-9]+ hours' \
                gag_extra_lines %; \
        /def -mglob -ag -p100 -t'You are affected by the following spells*' \
                gag_affected_by %; \
        /def -msimple -ag -p100 -t'You are not affected by any spells.' \
                gag_no_spells %; \
        /def -mglob -ag -p100 -t'Spell: starvation     : *' gag_starvation %;\
        /def -mglob -ag -t'Spell: *' gag_other_spells %;\
        /def -mregexp -p100 -ag -n2 -t'^<<[0-9]+ [0-9]+ [0-9]+> ' \
                kill_two_prompts %; \
        /def -mregexp -p90 -ag -n2 -t'\^\$' kill_two_spaces %; \
        /send aff %;\
        /send whisper

aff causes the mud to send the affects which recast_prep parses,
whisper causes the mud to send a trigger line which starts the next
part ...

/def recast_prep_2 = \
        /undef recast_test_arm %; \
        /undef recast_test_prot %; \
[and so on, the whole stuff from recast_prep.]


/def re1 = \
        /recast_prep %;\
        /def -p100 -mregexp -1 -F -ag \
                -t'^(You whisper nonsense to yourself !|In your dreams, or what?)' \
                catch_whisper = \
                /recast_prep_2 %%;\
                /recasting_one

[you whisper... is the trigger from /send whisper]

/def recasting_one = \
        /set Goodplace=0 %; \
        /if (Place !~ 'City' & Place !~ 'Inside') %; \
                /set Goodplace=1 %; /endif %; \
        /if (am_prot=0 & Goodplace=1) /prot %; \
        /elseif (am_bark=0) /bark %; \
        /elseif (am_shielded=0 & Goodplace=1) /shield %; \
        /elseif (am_ap=0) /ap %; \
[and some more ... ]
        /elseif (Goodplace=1) /echo -ah ">>>All spells are up." %;\
        /else /echo -ah ">>>All POSSIBLE spells are up." %; \
        /endif  

I guess it crashes before this recasting_one is executed, even before
the trigger whisper is recieved.

Is it possable to reorder worlds other then by disconnecting from all of
them and reconnecting in the order you want them?
I have not seen it in the help but if its there then sorry for bothering

I know how you feel.... I do it occasionally also.

I just tried to re-define the key with unbind and a new def... to no
avail, it locked up on me yet again. :(

Hopefully someone has an answer to this one.

In my case, my worlds list is saved as the file 'tf.world', but your
preferences may be different.  In any rate, I simply edit the textfile
with my favorite text editor, and move the lines of the /addworld entries
around as I see fit.  In fact, this is how I add all my entries as well,
so as to put the world in the organizational spot I want right from the
start.
 
Hope this helps!

I have recently encountered an interesting problem in tf 3.5b4.
I use redirection to get tf up and running with a few commands, start up a
connection to a MUD, and then let the triggers watch over the character.

This in itself is no problem.  The problem is that one of the triggers
disconnects from the MUD and then attempts to reconnect.  What happens is that
when the "startup" commands in the script to start tf are over, tf closes
standard input, as there is nothing else to read.  This makes fd 0 available
for other things, such as sockets.  socket() returns 0 on the next call, and tf
removes it from the fd_set, as it thinks it is standard input, and not a
socket.

I haven't looked at it much more than this, so I don't know how easy it would
be to fix.

One other little problem I've noticed:
in tf-lib/tintin.tf:

/def -i snoop   = \
                /if /ismacro _snoop_%1%; /then \
                        /@echo %% Snooping %1 disabled.%;\
                        /undef _snoop_%1%;\
                        /undef _snoopbg%1%;\
                /else \
                        /@echo %% Snooping %1 enabled.%;\
                        /def -i -w%1 -hbackground -ag _snoopbg_%1%;\
                        /def -i -t* -p9999 -w%1 -ag -F _snoop_%1 = \  
                                /@echo $${world_name}: %%*%;\
                /endif

There should be an underscore in the second /undef, to match the /def in the
definition below it.

same problem, but with ctrl-s 

It's especially bad, as I used to have a macro assigned to it and I keep

That problem (^S) may be something related to flow control. I have to deal
with it from time to time.

Try hitting control-q.

	well I know this isnt a way to fix it in tf.. but it should work..
if you use a term emulator, such as netterm or something.. you should be
able to redefine the key combination before it is sent.. that way TF would
never receive the sequence.  Just an idea.

I had that suspicion, but ctrl-q doesn't help. Also it only happened after I 
installed the beta4 version. Anyway, I am getting used to using ctrl-a instead
and only mentioned it b/c of the ctrl-o message incase it might be the same
bug/feature.

This is probably stupid, but I've double checked the help ...

How do I match part of a regexp?  I want to hilight a sub-pattern.
Ie, use %P1 as part of /def -P ?

I have:
/def -wTower -F -PBCgreen -t'^(\([0-9]+\)) You ' SeeChannelsMeTower
for matching some communications.  But I only want to highlight the
parenthesized number.

Thanks.

Hi all
I have recently had to move servers and am now having problems with tinyfugue.
I cant compile ver 3.5 on this server runnibg digital unix ver 4.0 although a friend of mine has told me there should be no problems.
Because of this I am running 3.3 and a lot of stuff i wrote for 3.5 will not work :(
I was therefore wondering is there any way of say getting a pre compiled ver of 3.5 ?
OR are there any other suggestions ?

Thanks 

Hugh Trevelyan

/def -wTower -F -P1BCgreen -t'^(\([0-9]+\)) You ' SeeChannelsMeTower

note the "1" after the P.  This means highlight the first paranthesised
part.  If you had something like:

/def -wTower -F -P2BCgreen -t'^(Star)?(\([0-9]+\)) You ' SeeChannelsMeTower

This would highlight the stuff inside the second set of parenthesis.

Hi all, I am aon a MU* where I need to search a 10x26 grid for one specific point. As I move
the vehicle, I get output such as:

Loc: PJ 406 NW Heading: SE Altitude: 29S, Speed: 1.
The scanner light blinks rapidly, as you pass near a claim site.  You see no traces of a
paintmark.

What I want it to do is keep a map, in the form:

9 | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
8 | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
7 | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
6 | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
5 | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
4 | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
3 | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
2 | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
1 | A B C D * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
0 | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
--------------------------------------------------------
    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Where the left is the 1-10 axis, the bottom is A-Z. The A, B, C, and D on the chart indicate
an explored sector. The * indicates I've found a suitable place to land (The paintmark message
would, when you find it, say something along the lines of 'The scanner flashes rapidly
indicating a landing spot has been found.'), and when it finds *, send the command 'Stop' to
the MU*.


Ideas of where to start?

Here is the gist of the problem. I connect through a BBS that has an rlogin
to a unix box so I can use TF as a MUD client. BUT The rlogin does not
allow me to use the BBS globals. Now I want to open another connection back
toi the BBS froim TF, but when I do the system sort of won't connect
properly. Have tried using both wht /world and /telnet commands. The
address of the BBS is pointbbs.com. I am at a total loss here and anty
helpo would be appreciated

What exactly is the error message?  If it is a tf-detected "internal error",
the error message will contain enough information for me to begin to track
it down.

Unix predefines some ctrl keys for you. To see what the keys are type `stty -a'
at your unix prompt. If there is a contrl-whatever there that is bothering you
undefine it using `stty <signal> <key>'. For example, to get rid of the
control-o (which you'll see is used for `flush'), enter `stty flush ""'.

Ctrl-s is used to stop the flow of output to your screen, ctrl-q is used to
start it again.

Hello,

I've been using tf for a while now, but really only got into the neat
stuff it can do now. Was wondering if someone could me some suggestions on
the problems I ran in to.

Is it possible to /bind the tab key to esc+$ to use with kb-bash? It seems
that no macros I make with /bind \9 work.

Is it possible to make /qmud work with diku muds that don't have an
outputprefix/suffix in any way? Or to get something like /egrep to work on
mud commands?

Also, I have just begun to understand how regexps work, but they are still
very hard to make, is there a place I could see some more complex examples
of regexp triggers? Right now what I wanted to do was to make a trigger
that would work something like this:
/def -mregexp -t'gossips \'How do I get to'=... and somehow get the
parameter values for the first word to the right of the expression and the
first word in the expression.

Thanks in advance for any help,

JohnGalt of Dark Wizardry (galactus.starnetc.com 6969)

; assuming the last single quote would be the end of the line...
/def -i -mregexp -t" gossips 'How do I get to (.*)'$" catch_gossip = \
  /echo name: %PL %;\
  /echo destination: %P1

A few notes:
	1) I made it -i, so that it doesn't show up in /list, etc.
	2) I used double quotes for the -t part, so that you don't
	   have to escape out the single quote.
	3) I named the trigger.
	4) I put a space before "gossips" so that %PL (the name, I
	   assume), doesn't have a space in it when it gets to you.
	5) Using (.*) is kinda bad, as it's very general.  If you
	   don't mind having a single quote at the end of every
	   (valid) destination (you could fix this by always stripping

 I have a problem concerning a gag / echo trigger I've made. What it does
is basically this: I get a text every now and then containing my stats
(hitpoints, spellpoints, etc). I gag that text and stuff the various parts
into variables, and then I echo them locally with a different look and a
counter which counts what has changed since last report and so on.

 My problem is that this echo seems to be sending newline each time it is
called. Which is really annoying if I'm e.g. writing a message or other
things in an editor.

 Am I doing something wrong perhaps, or is this a feature/bug?

Hi 

If i am starting tf, i see a lot of 'loading commands' messages at startup
because i need most of the *.tf files for playing.
Since they are now about 15 files to load (many selfmade have been added)
i want to load them 'quiet' as like the -q option as command-line parameter
supresses the world login output.

Is there any way to supress these many load messages ?


Looking forward for any hints
  Freddy

Two possibilities:
In your .tfrc put a line like
/def -i -n20 -hLOAD gag_20_load
where 20 is the number of files you typically load

or you could gag all of them with
/def -i -hLOAD gag_all_load

I know tinyfugue has a way to see the output that scrolled off the
screen
by typing /recall <number of lines here>.

But how come TF doesn't have a way where you can scroll the buffer
up and down. Just about every client I seen has this feature. Basicly
all you need is the ability to scroll back using arrow keys or function
keys or control keys or anything beable to cut from the text, etc.

In mudding this feature would be extreamly usefful. I know there is
a win32 version coming out for NT/95 so i'll be able to use it on
my own computer. Anyone know if the NT version will support
ansi color ?

Seems I was misunderstood. I want to scroll back thru commands I typed.
That I already know I can do. What I need to do a lot and is one reason
why I have to use tf thru a telnet program such a procomm plus for dos.

Is software like this or most mud clients have a feature were you can
scroll
thru output. Outut meaning anything that comes thru your screen not what

you input. Say you are on a mud. you type 'who' to see all the players
on
but it scrolled off your screen. sure you can use /recall <number of
lines>
but its very cheesy. What I want to know is why TF can't have a feature
where you can hit some key or key combination that would allow you
to scroll back thru history like that 'who' list I mentioned be able to
cut
from it to save to a file or something. right TF. But using /recall
for a scrollback is very difficult to use. You have to guess how many
lines
scrolled by your screen , but still what if you wanted to cut some text
from a whole bunch of stuff that flew by your screen you would have to
guess
the start location of that text. well by now I hope I more clear.

A feature like this would make TF rocking product. Scroll back is one
of the prime features needed in mudding. I imagine a lot of you
like me are using telnet clients on windows,dos or what not which
already have a scroll back feature and then you connect to your ISP
thru a modem and start TF and use its features. Since TF already
already stores scroll back how much harder can it be to make something
that can scroll up/down full screen thru the /recall buffer ?

Anyways this would be a very cool feature to put in. If I knew enough
about how the program worked and had the time I would do it my self :)

You already can scroll back through command history. Try /recall -i, or
use ctrl-p to go back one command at a time. (ctrl-n goes forward if you
go back too far.)
If you want to find one line among many, give /recall some options, such
as /recall -i 100 *blah* will look among your input for a string blah
(assuming you're using glob matching, otherwise just use blah)

Tinyfugue is originally a Unix utility.  It runs within a text-terminal.
This could be an ancient physical text-only terminal, such as an ADM3e
that I can see across the room from me and often use, or a terminal
emulator running within a graphical environment.  Just how is tinyfugue
supposed to provide a generic scrollbar utility?

When using rxvt or xterm under the X11 Windowing System (as I am now) one
does have scrollbars.  They're provided by the terminal emulator, not by
the application running within the terminal.  Other methods of
scrollback are provided.  Linux consoles, for example, have something
like shift-pageup/down to scroll through output.

For tinyfugue to provide scrollbars, it would have to open its own
window.  This would dramatically reduce its portability and usefulness
for many people.

 Then why don't you get a cut/paste program for your mouse? Shouldn't be
that hard to get by, I would expect.

 Personnally, I use the rxvt scrollbar in case things scrolled out of my
page, and since I'm too lazy to install a cut/paste daemon I just retype
things by hand. Not that hard, and I'm not even a very fast writer.

Being admin, I log all sessions to file. Then I can examine all of it at my
leisure, using whatever tool suits my need.

I use a local editor as an editor in moo's. It works with vi, pico or any
other editor we like. It just uses a file named  localedit.tf (that can be
renamed) that someone did. I can't email it to you, if you want. it was
given to me by a friend. 
I think this is what you asked.

I just use a set of macros like this:

; recall macros
/def b = /recall /10
/def back = /recall /20
/def back2 = /recall /60
/def back3 = /recall /100
/def back4 = /recall /500

Then when I'm looking for something I just guess and if it's
not there use the next one up.

 In regards to the scroll back buffer, has anyone developed a GUI for TF? 
I haven't seen anything about this, but I think it's a good idea. If
enough people are interested, I could program a tf GUI for X that has a
scroll back buffer. Please let me know what you think.

Can somebody tell me what the rules for matching world
types are?

I discovered the other day that a world of type "tiny.mush.sye" will
use hooks defined for type "tiny.mush", and I can't find
documentation about this anywhere.  Are there any other tricks
I could use?

I use something like the above, but it is a bit more directed...

/def  says     /recall -w -mglob -t /20 *says:*
/def  shouts   /recall -w -mglob -t /20 *shouts:*
/def  tells    /recall -w -mglob -t /20 *tells you:*

etc.  A friend of mine came up with those to solve the problem that 
arises when you're moving around the mud too fast and just see tells, etc,
flash by.

The -T argument uses the -m argument (or %{matching} if none is explicitly
given) to decide whether a worldtype matches.  So, a trigger (or hook etc)
defined as -Ttiny.mush will run in worlds of type tiny.mush.foo,
tiny.mush.bar, tiny.mush, etc, _if_ regexp matching is used.  If you use
glob matching, then -Ttiny.mush* will run in the same worlds as above.

I use this worldtype matching mechanism to restrict triggers in worlds where
I have 'alt' characters:

/addworld -Ttiny.muck ...  (normal world)
/addworld -Ttiny.mux ... (another normal world)
/addworld -Ttiny.muck.notrig ... (world where I have an alt)

/def -p95 -mglob -Ttiny*.notrig -t'*' block_notrig

.. where I have most of my triggers defined as priorities <100, but hilites
>100.

Oh, good idea, I hadn't thought of that.  I solved -that- particular
problem by making them come up highlighted so it's easy to spot 'em
even in screens of scrollage.

Yes, we did that as well... but it got tiresome to see yellow tells fly
by, then have to /recall lots of the buffer to just see that one line.  So
now, when we see the yellow fly by, we can just do 'tells' and see what
we missed.

hi, i've got a question...

with sending a line that doesn't need to be terminated...

for example i want to send "x" but no \13\10 after it...
could anyone help me out ?
i would like to have it like this:

The easiest way is just to /send -n x (or whatever). You can bind ^N to
that if you want.

Hello!

I'v been trying to make a partial substitution for some time now,
but failed utterly. So now I ask you all for help :)

and example:
A hugh tree walking on big roots hits Kalle hard.
^      -- substitute --        ^
the Tree hits Kalle hard.

there is on the muf I play alot of colors and such, so I can't just
gag the line and echo a new, I need to replace the text only :)

Your's 
  /Bjorne

Hi,
   i need to filter colors...
   Or lets say it this way... i want to trigger an action 
   if a Letter is colored in a special way 
        (for example: letter "C", RED Background, yellow foreground)

i couldn't find out how to do that: i've tried \033 and things like that
but nothing did work... could anyone help me out ?

thanks,
       paul

Check out /help substitute.

e.g.
/def -F -q -p10 -mregexp -t'^A hugh tree walking on big roots' tree_sub =\
  /substitute The Tree %PR

Analysis:
- fall-thru so your other hilites, colours, and triggers will still work.
- Any line starting with "A hugh tree.." will be replaced with "The Tree "
and whatever comes after "roots". (look at /help %PR).

Any lower priority triggers will see "The Tree hits Kalle hard." instead of
the original line, and your colours should work fine, as long as they are of a
lower priority.  I believe partial hilites are lost if they were set from
a higher priority.

 Hi, I play on a mud which is telnet based, and tinfugue wont send the
necessary Cr/Lf combination so terminate the line in a PC manner. I know I'm
not explaining this well, but the problem is that I type a line of text, hit
enter, and the mud doesnt recognise that enters been hit. I've looked
through the docs, and cant find any mention of how to change the ^J linefeed
to a ^M. Any ideas?

Regards,
                   Jon

TF version 4.0 alpha 1 for UNIX, OS/2, and Win32 is now available at:
  ftp://tf.tcp.com/pub/tinyfugue/
  ftp://tcp.com/pub/mud/Clients/tinyfugue/



CHANGES for 4.0 alpha 1:

Ported to Win32.
%0 is the name of the executing macro.  This will break all existing code
  that uses %0 like %*.
Macros called as functions map function arguments to positional parameters.
  This will break existing code that expects a single function argument
  to be split into parameters by words.
Added /return (the old /return in map.tf is now called /revert).
Added the ability to format the visual status line ("/help %status_fields").
Added %| pipes ("/help evaluation").
Added floating point arithmetic.
Added sin(), cos(), tan(), asin(), acos(), atan().
Added abs(), exp(), log(), log10(), pow(), sqrt(), trunc().
Added tfopen(), tfclose(), tfread(), tfwrite() ("/help tfio").
Added inread(), nactive(), nlog(), nmail(), world_info(), fg_world().
Added /listvar.
Added %meta_esc.
Added /echo -p.
/listsockets -T<type> <name>.
/listworlds -u -m<style> -T<type>.
/purgeworld -T<type>.
/send -T<type>.
/load -q.
/unworld and /undef take multiple <name> arguments.
Added /edmac, /edvar, and /edworld in tools.tf.
Added NOMACRO hook.
getopts() supports numeric option arguments.
Improved mecho detail.
Macros can be called by number with "/#" syntax ("/help evaluation").
Counter in visual More prompt is better updated.
Partial attributes are always preserved by /recall.
Clearing input buffer resets index for /dokey SEARCH[BF] functions.
Optimized macro processing.
Improved interactive response when sockets are very active.
/list -s option may be mixed with other options.
Fixed /substitute within /trigger
Fixed support for 8-bit locales, including support for LC_CTYPE, LC_TIME,
  and LC_ALL variables.  See "/help locale".
Fixed "tcsetattr: Bad file number" and disabled keyboard. (35b4)
Fixed rare sometimes fatal bug in handling server attributes with lp=on
  and a slow connection.
Fixed duplicate command when /speedwalk and /mark (map.tf) are used together.
Fixed compilation error involving conditional and hstrerror under some
  lame compilers (socket.c:788).
Fixed output misdirection during a read() inside a command sub.
Fixed rare bug causing command line to execute in wrong world when a
  simultaneous background trigger occured.
Fixed /world with no arguments.
Fixed fatal input bug after /histsize -i. (35a21)
Fixed bug which disabled history recording after /recall on an empty history.
Fixed memory leaks in synchronous processes, etc.
Fixed "/lp off" while at a prompt.
Fixed opening of new descriptors after standard input redirection.
Fixed bug in handling trailing '-' in a glob [] character class.





README for Win32:

At this time, TF for win32 is available only in source form.  To compile
it, you will need the Cygwin Development Kit (cdk.exe), available at
http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/.  Once you have the CDK installed,
follow the instructions for compiling TF under UNIX.

The CDK is rather large (over 13M), and not for the novice user.  If you
have trouble with it, DON'T ASK ME.  I plan to make a binary release of TF
(which will require only the 500K cygwin.dll) when I get the time, so wait
for that if you can't deal with the CDK.

There are several known problems with the win32 version of tf, mostly due
to shortcomings of cygwin:
 * Scrolling in visual mode is jumpy.
 * /quote ! (and code that calls it, like /sys) is not supported.
 * Compressed files are not supported.
 * Nonblocking hostname resolution (%gethostbyname) is not supported.

I use triggers to get names and special acts in colour, but I have found
that TF only put one word in colour on each line, if there are several
words on the same line that should be in different colour, only one of
them works.  Why is this, and I hope someone have a solution or that is
can be fixed in the next version of TF.  It wold be very nice to be able
to get several different colours on the same line.

Here is the way the triggers are:
/def -p2 -P0Ccyan -mregexp -t'[tT] ells [yY]ou '
or
/def -p1 -P0Cgreen -mregexp -t'[kK]hazad '

Hi there,

I use the /set clock=24-hour setting for tf. However, something seems to be
wibble about it with the new tf. The clock doesn't seem to want to show 24
hour time, or it just displays the time 12 hours behind. Yet, doing a /time
gives me the correct time:

21:44
_________Seasons___________________________________________________________09:44

/time

Cheers,
Meglos.

I admit, I do not yet know how this new tf works _exactly_.
But I did find a quite annoying problem: /ismacro when used in
/if (ismacro("bla")) always is false. (And that construction is
used quite a lot in my .tfrc ;-)

This seems to be fixed with the new definition:
/def -i ismacro = /last $(/list -s -i %{*-@}%;/return %?)

I am not sure whether this is a "bug" in ismacro or in the
builtin /test function.

Looks good!

I love the configurable status line. However, I can't highlight with
color attributes.

Simple, cut down example:

/set status_fields @read:6:Cred
% set: Field @read followed by garbage: red

/set status_fields @read:6:C
% set: valid values for color are: black, red, green, yellow, blue,
magenta, cyan, white, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, bgblack, bgred,
bggreen, bgyellow, bgblue, bgmagenta, bgcyan, bgwhite


Also, it would be nice to have a way to tell it not to seperate fields
with an underscore, so that they 'touch' each other. As well as have the
fields be highlightable like the new /echo. (With @{whatever})


Is there a DISCONNECT hook that gets triggered even with /dc ?

Was wondering for the Win32 version if this could include a full screen
scroll back feature. I know on the unix side termianls may not be able
to support this. But I like to use this new program to replace my
existing communcations package that I use. Basicly many times I need
to scroll back thru the history real quick. Problem with /recall is that
I
can't hold the history or freeze it cut and past. There is -more-
feature
if the author can't do it maybe someone can ?

Me my self I know C++ a somewhat, but I am not familiar with
how the code works. Otherwise I do it my self :)

Also does the Win32 version support ANSI colors. I was told
Win32 console under NT doesn't support color thru ansi.sys.

Tf stops comparing triggers when the first one matches.  If you don't
want that to happen, you have to mark the trigger as fall-thru with -F.

You should also always name your macros.

/def -p2 -F -P0Ccyan -mregexp -t'[tT] ells [yY]ou ' colour_tells

etc.

Use:
/set status_int_clock ftime("%H:%M", time())

To disable the clock entirely use:
/set status_fields @more:8:Br @world @read:6 @active:11 @log:5 @mail:6 insert:6

As for the scroll-back buffer... What you need to do is write
a version of the 'console' window that supports scrollback and
run TF under it.  I'd say this was something generic enough to
say that Hawkeye should NOT do it.

ANSI color works just fine under Win-95.

I'll poke around on the net for improved comsole versions and report back.

 Does anyone know where I can find a re-sizable Win32 DOS window, so I can
get tf to run in a window larger than 25 lines? Or how about an rxvt or
xterm port? ;-)

Add -F for "fallthrough" to the /def arguments.  Mine look like this:

/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush.sye" -F -PCcyan -t'has departed.$' SYEdepart
/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush.sye" -F -PCcyan -t'joins you.$' SYEjoins
/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush.sye" -F -PCgreen -t'^<[A-Za-z]+>' SYEooc

... and so on.

Windows NT supports a scrollback buffer for it's 'console' windows.
Click on Properties/Layout/Screen Buffer Size and change height to
whatever you like.

How about making diffs available so those who already had the
source for a1 can just download the diff?  It'd save on download
time/bandwidth!

Hi,

W. Weisselberg posted the output of the debugger after the crash which
makes both our half-robots in tf unusable. I just installed version 4.0a2
and had the same problem again :-(

Here is the output of the debugger:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

The only command that triggers on this text is

/def -p200 -mregexp -F -t'^<([0-9]+)/' t_prompt = /set hp %{P1}

The variable hp (hit points) is used quite often, but not for status 
lines or anything which should be processed at the moment of the crash.
As the line it triggers on is my prompt, this trigger worked very very 
often until the crash occured.

It's quite unhealthy to play a player killing MUD with a client that 
crashes, so I would love to see this bug found and fixed in one of the 
next versions :-)

Ah, I'm running tf under Solaris (SunOS 5.5).

With a lot of respect for your wonderful work on this client, Ken,

   Susan Dittmar

Hi,

Oh, looks like I have not used the right words when I described the 
problem.
The same trigger is triggered LOTS of times before, no crash occures. 
Sometimes tf works (completely as robot) for 2 or 3 hours without crash, 
and then after restart crashes after 5 minutes again with exactly the
same messages. Always the same line of code, always a line where only
this one trigger acts on.
I'm sure it's not the trigger itself that makes tf crash, it's something 
in the handling of the trigger or variable within tf itself.

News for Win32 folks:

I have an installer which sets up TF-40a2, the CygWin32 DLL, and the
registry keys needed for CygWin to be happy.  It also adds a program group and
icons.

I am willing to maintain this installer over future releases, so
Mr. Keys won't have to.

Where should I post it?

It would be possible to write a wrapper program, making it generic
enough to remain separate from the underlying program.

You could get some milage from using a derivation of RichEditView,
which supports color text and character-level formatting.

It's at http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Studios/8949/
and follow the link!

It's a full wizard-based install with uninstaller (in case you don't like the
way I do things)

It's also ZIP compatable, so you can just pull out the files
with WinZIP or something.  Just remember that TF is a bit touchy
about file locations... if you use the installer it will
work.

What I'd like to do is have the status line redefined depending on what
world is currently in the foreground. Any time the foreground world is
changed, the proper status line attributes would be fetched and set to
status_fields. Can this be done with a hook, or would I need to write
macros for each and every world, like:

/def mud=/world Mud1%;/set status_fields=etc...

I have had this problem with TF for a long time but never cared since I
allways used it thru a shell account thru a pcplus for dos.

This is when connected to either a Diku or LP mud.
TF a lot of times will be sitting there at the prompt thinking that no
activity is going on. Then when I hit enter boom 5 pages of text flashes

by the screen so fast you can't see it. Is there anyway to make it so
TF doesn't just sit there when more activity happens. This is very
annoying.

Also I tried creating a scrollback soltuion till someone programs a
better
one in. This macro doesn't work like I think it should.

/def x = /set more=on%;/set more%;/recall %1%;/set more=off

The idea is to have more on when recall is on and then turn it off.
Having more on when playing is extreamly anoying. Just another
reason I am dying for a scroll back thats interactive.

If anyone can help with the two problems would be appreicated.
By the way this is tinyfugue being used under WINT.

oh and one more thing /sh doesn't work. Don't know if this
is tinyfugue or the way it was compiled.

thanks

This macro will not work, because more is turned off again
immediately: TF functions do not stop their work when you get a more
prompt ;-) If you want more to be turned off when you are done
reading the text you recalled, then you will have to type
/set more=off yourself.

There is no hook called when you're more prompts have ended, so
there is no way you can let TF handle this automatically.

Hiho!

Thnks for the status_fields. That's the one thing that I have been missing
in tf....and one more reason to tell those Windoze-user that tf is better
than zmud and the like. :)

But now for the stupid questions:

I'm experiencing trouble with the attribute flasch (-f).
When I try "/echo -af Test" there is no flashing. My terminal should
support it, so I don't know where my mistake is. Or could it be, that it's
a bug in the new version (40a2)?

Please help.

Hmm.. encountering a real wierd "bug" trying to get this baby to even
compile.  Modded unix/Config to point the executable to a new
location, /home/dhill/tf-40/tf to be ecaxt, yet unixmake gives the
following:

This is an alpha version, and so may not be fully tested on some
platforms.  With the new features comes the possibility of new bugs. 
If you don't want to deal with this, get the latest beta version. 

TF binary will be installed as     /home/dhill/tf
Library, help, and utilities:      /home/dhill/tf-40/tf-lib/

Doesn't make much sense.. any ideas out there?

The unix/Config file doesn't seem to want to accept my EXE changes; if I 
uncomment it and specify some other destination, it simply overrides it and 
assumes I want /usr/local/bin/tf.  I know it worked in 3.5, but it 
hasn't in any 4.x version.

Hi listfolk!

It's nothing important, but when i start TinyFugue 4.0x
(either of both versions), i get the following messages,
before any other files i specified in my .tfrc are loaded:

TinyFugue version 4.0 alpha 2
Copyright (C) 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 Ken Keys (hawkeye@tcp.com)
Type `/help copyright' for more information.
Regexp package is Copyright (c) 1986 by University of Toronto.
Type `/help', `/help topics', or `/help intro' for help.
Type `/quit' to quit tf.

% Invalid locale for LC_CTYPE.
% LC_TIME category set to "C" locale.

.... (then everything continues as usual)

It's nothing i can't just ignore, nevertheless, i was wondering
what kind of error has occured there. Can anyone help ?

Oh, and yes, i am using a PC with Linux 2.29.

Thanks in advance, happy mudding ..

Klaus

I need to know how to disable all of this special prompt hook stuff
that tinyfugue setups. I dont care about capruting the prompt.
The mud I play on doesn't need this feature. And it causes
new activaty not to show on my screen till I hit enter example

I see a prompt like that. Then I hit enter and all the sudden there was
2 screens
of activity buffered. I just want to kill this prompt hooking or
whatever
else it sets, please help. Thanks

I have a whole bunch of /def's that gag various lines from the server
and rewrite them by doing /echo -w with the new output.

I -also- have, with a lower priority, a bunch of /def's to do
highlighting.

The problem is this:  Although the highlights work fine for the lines
coming direct from the server, they totally miss any of the /echo -w'd
lines.

Is there any way to fix this?  Its driving me nuts.

Does the -T (world type) parameter have any meaning for a
macro that's called by name?

I would have -expected- that something liek this:

/def -T"tiny.mush" testme = /echo *** testme

would only have been available in worlds of type tiny.mush but
that seems not to be the case?  Is there any way to define a
macro so it's only available in one type of world?

Hi all.

I found a rather odd 'problem' with the status lines.

It seems when I have something set up to just show me one thing (doesn't
matter what, really), it appears at first at the left of my line. When
however, I change the variable that I set up, the changed variable appears
*right* centered all of a sudden.

When I do a screen clear and redraw (with ^L), it switched back to the
left again..

Rather odd behaviour. Anyone else having this same problem?

Mad.

The -T and -w fields only have meaning on triggers.  If you want to
restrict a macro you can always:

/def testme = \
    /let wt=${world_type}%;\
    /if (wt =/ "tiny.mush") \
	/echo *** testme%;\
    /endif

When a trigger's set off by /trigger, then /substitute
commands inside it don't seem to work.  Is this a
feature or a bug or have I done something wrong?

I believe this was a bug that crept into the 3.5betas.  It works
correctly in 4.0a2.

/def -Fp2 -mglob -t'foobie' foobie = /substitute barbie
/def -p1 -mglob -t'barbie' barbie = /echo got barbie
/def -p1 -mglob -t'foobie' foobie2 = /echo got foobie


then `/trigger foobie' yields `got barbie' as expected

Sometimes when I dont type in anything and come back
and then I hit enter pages of text will fly by. So why does tinyfugue
like to stop displaying out after a while if you dont type anything.
Its like it freezes. I am using this under NT but this problem exists on

TF under unix as well.

*ponders*

That's not quite what I was trying to do, maybe I'm doing it wrong.
What I want to do, essentially, is inject text into the world stream
in such a way that it DOES get processed by lower-priority triggers.

Now where I'm just altering text that's already coming from the
server, /substitute works perfectly.  But I've got a few commands
that give output out where there's none from the server to
substitute, and I can't make them work.  My idea was instead
of using "/echo -w some text"  to use "/trigger LOCAL some text"
and then have a trigger like this:

/def -p501 -T"test" -F -t'^LOCAL (.*)$' local_trigger = \
   /substitute %P1

so I end up with the proper text in the world stream.  But it
doesn't work.


The -reason- that /echo -w doesn't do what I want, is that I have
a bunch of lower priority triggers which do syntax highlighting
on most of my text and text generated by /echo -w doesn't get
processed through triggers.


Any way?

Yes, assuming that your first trigger is something like this:

/def -p200 -F -t'some pattern' mud_trigger = \
    /trigger LOCAL some text


You can do this:

/def local_substitute = /set lsub_var=%*

/def -p200 -F -t'some pattern' mud_trigger = \
    /local_substitute %*%;\
    /trigger LOCAL some text%;\
    /substitute %{lsub_var}

And use /local_substitute in your local triggers.

Also, I strongly recommend that instead of prefixing with `LOCAL', that
instead you make a dummy world, and have the local_trigger in that world 
and use /trigger -w.  ${world_name} and similar maintain their original
values, so it doesn't change any existing behaviour you have.


/addworld local localhost echo
/histsize -wlocal 10

/def local_substitute = /set lsub_var=%*

/def -p200 -F -t'some pattern' mud_trigger = \
    /local_substitute %*%;\
    /trigger -wlocal some text%;\
    /substitute %{lsub_var}

/def -p501 -wlocal -F -t'^(.*)$' local_trigger = \
    /local_substitute %P1



An example of another similar usage of /trigger -w for having a separate 
set of triggers instead of using prefixes like `LOCAL' can be found in:

 What I would like to see implemented is a way to get the status line into
a non-visual mode. Like a visual mode with isize=0, where you type above
the status line, not below it.

Is there a way to clear the history for a particular world?    I have
a macro that saves the current world's buffer to a file, but I've
noticed if I connect to a world and do stuff, then disconnect, when I
-reconnect- to the same world (without quitting TF between, of course)
all the text from both sessions of that world is in the buffer.  I'd
like some sort of way to clear the buffer of old stuff, probably one I
could attach to a connect hook.

I would say make a connect trigger that sets the worlds %histsize to a 
rediculously low number than back to normal. Something like:
-
.   /def -p1000 -F -h'CONNECT' clear_hist = \
.     /recordline -w${world_name}%;\
.     /histsize -w${world_name} 1%;\
.     /eval /histsize -w${world_name} %{histsize}
-
I'm not sure how to gag the lines generated by /histsize though but I 
think it does what you ask.

I like this idea. Although I currently don;t have a use for it, I can 
see the potential it has.

Although, as an improvement, I'd like to some way of having it so if the 
server sends a certain text, the trigger adds an additional piece of 
text immediately _after_ the sent text, and have both pieces processed 
by triggers and such.

Useing the suggested fragment and making minor modifications to it, I 
came up with something similiar. Unfortunately, the added text, comes 
_before_ the triggering text. If I could figure out how to have it come 
immediately after, I'd be happy.

I did try to have it so that a trigger sets up another trigger for 
'^.*$' and that resulting trigger sends the additional piece of text, 
but the prompt gets in the way if it comes immediately after the 
original triggering text. I suppose I could add something to catch 
prompts, but empty prompts don't trigger the PROMPT hook.

To me it sounds like an option to be added. Some way to 'hold' an echo 
till after all the /def's are processed and the triggering text is sent 
(or not if gagged) before the /echo or what-have-you is displayed.

Why do you use /eval here?  It's a bad habit to use /eval when it's not
needed, since it will bite you some day.

If you are using 4.0, histsize used as an expression function returns
the number of lines.  So you can restore the world to the same amount of 
history that it previously had.

/def clear_hist =\
    /quote -S /: `/clear_hist_ %1

/def clear_hist_ =
    /let old_size=$[histsize("-w%1")]%;\
    /histsize -w%1 1%;\
    /recordline -w%1%;
    /histsize -w%1 %{old_size}

Where the /quote /: `/foo or a  /: $(...) will eat the output you don't
care about.


You could also just /unworld the world and /addworld it again.  Which
will also start renumbering the history at 1 again, unlike the resizing
approach above.

needed, since it will bite you some day.
---- Stuff clipped ----
---- End of Original message ----

I put the /eval in there because I haven;t tested the code, it's off the 
top of my head, and when I tried to  put

/histsize -l %{histsize}

in a loaded file, it gives me an error about an invalid number. Since it 
works with /eval I'm assuming that it's taking %{histsize} literally for 
whatever reason.

Normally, I try to use functions and macros that are already available.

Hi,
i want to /echo all capitalized words in a room description.
I tried it with

/def -p1 -mregexp -t'([A-Z]([a-z])+)+' detail = /echo %P1

but this gives only the first capitalized word in a line, how can
i /echo all capitalized words?

Ciao

Try putting a /while loop in the body of the macro:

/let line=%* %;\
/while (regmatch("[A-Z][A-Za-z]+", line)) \
  /let line=%{PL}%{PR} %;\
  /echo %{P0} %;\
/done

I cleaned up the regexp a bit, as you don't need all those parens.
On each iteration, the word matched will be taken out of the line, and
looped again.

Tried it. If the server sends a series of lines and the first of those 
lines were the triggering lext then the '/quote -0' thing comes after 
_all_ the lines instead of just after the one causeing the trigger (that 
is turn caused the /quote).

Hi Ken,

there's a little bug in the install program for tf 4.0a2 (for unix):

EXE="/home/dittmar/tf/bin/tf-${TFVER}"
LIBDIR="/home/dittmar/tf/lib/tf-${TFVER}-lib"
SYMLINK="/home/dittmar/bin/tf-40a2"

leads to:
                                   
TF binary will be installed as     /home/dittmar/bin/tf
    with a symbolic link:          /home/dittmar/bin/tf-40a2
Library, help, and utilities:      /home/dittmar/tf/lib/tf-40a2-lib/

As I said, it's a little bug, but changing it would perhaps be helpful 
for  
those users, who don't know much about unix ...

With best regards,

    Susan Dittmar

If the server sends TF multiple lines all at once (say, in the same TCP/IP
packet), then I'm afraid TF is not capable of turning back time and sneaking
in one line before the rest of the lines arrive.  If they arrive together,
they arrive together, and you can't do anything about that.

Also there is propogation time to consider - TF cannot communicate with
your server instantaneously.  If you are running TF over a slow PPP link,
or your net access is otherwise high in latency, then you will not get
trigger replies sneaking in exactly where you like.

On some muds we have races to see whose trigger can go off first.  :)

I know I asked this before, but I never got an answer that I
could make work:

How can I generate a line from a local macro (NOT a trigger or
a hook) in such a way that it gets processed through the
triggers for the current world?

	Ok, a couple things here. Mostly this is refinement and not a 
real problem.

	I can use 
		/quote -S -decho !command
	and
		/sys command
	they both produce the same results, but I was wondering which one 
is more efficient. I'm assuming the /sys, but you what they say about 
assuming.

	Also, either way the macro execution takes a second or two to 
complete. Meanwhile TF seems to be kinna stuck and nothing comes up on my 
screen untill afterwards. I don't lose any input or output, but the pause 
is annoying. Is there anyway to have a macro run as a background process?

/list -i sys
% 8: /def -i sys = /quote -S -decho \\!!%{*-:}

/sys is more compact and easier to read, but must go through one more
execution cycle.  I'd suggest using the /sys, since readability is way more
important than shaving off a millisecond from the execution time (unless
you are running a really critical program).

Sure, omit the -S from /quote.

/list -i sys

% 7: /def -i sys = /quote -S -decho \\!!%{*-:}


If you don't want to wait for the sub process to finish, you can use
/quote -0 instead.  The -S explicitly means synchronous (ie, it blocks
until the other finishes).

There is no different between hooks, triggers and macros other than how
you cal them, their execution is the same.  So if you can do it from a
trigger or hook, it'll work from a macro.

/trigger will let you run things through the current world trigger sets, 
but it won't show the text to the screen.  There's no way currently to
completely emulate a line coming from the mud.

What is that status of Tinyfugue and compiling on Solaris 2.5.1? The
web page mentions a problem with 2.4 that can be fixed with a Solaris
patch, but then states that the problem may be back in 2.5. Has anyone
compiled tf on Solaris 2.5.1, and if so, any special tricks?

The person that requested this may want to considder getting the MUD to
echo the line back, tho the ability to make a line appear to be coming
from a world should be possable if someone wanted to hack it in the
source..

Does anyone know if the new tf will work on a system with Win3.1 with
the Win32s extentions?

The reason I ask is that I do not have the HD space to run Win95/NT.

Thanks,
Mark

It didn't run on my university's Win32S. But that's hardly anything reliable
to go on.

Hello everyone, this isnt a tf concern per se but I dont know how else to
begin looking for an answer on this.  Periodically I get an audit email to
see if I am still subscribed to the list.  Can anyone tell me how to
obtain that functionality for a list I run using Majordomo if that is
possible with MD even?

You might want to considder switching over to linux and using wine to run
any Win 3.1 programs you need...
Other then that your probley not going to have to much luck :/

If you are just wanting to send some text to all the worlds, you can use 
/send -W in your /repeat.

Otherwise, let's say you want to emulate:

/repeat -W -TIME COUNT COMMAND

You can use:

/def command_in_all =\
    /let body=%{*}%;\
    /command_in_all_ $(/listsockets -s)

/def command_in_all_ =\
    /while ({#}) \
	/repeat -S -w%{1} 1 %{body}%;\
	/shift%;\
    /done

And then: /repeat -TIME COUNT /command_in_all COMMAND

So `/command_in_all /echo ${world_name}' lists the worlds you are on.
And `/command_in_all /echo -w ${world_name}' echoes each world name to
that particular world.  (Be sure to backslach special forms when needed.)

Just have whatever's being repeated use -W (if it can), so for example

/def sendallworlds = /send -W whatever%; /repeat -00:05 1 /sendallworlds

I've got a whole bunch of key bindings set up to do with changing
worlds, like this

; cycle through active worlds
/bind  = /fg ->

(Just one example) but noticed that pressing keys bound like this
doesn't reset the counter to stop the "more" prompt triggering.

Quite often I'll be mostly idle in more than one world, and I'll
occasionally just press ^W a few times to read the few lines in 
each world, and I'll get the -more?- prompt and have to press
tab - even though there hasn't been a whole screenful of text
since I pressed ^W.

Is this a bug or a misfeature??

Ok.  Let me first say that I /love/ the new configurable status line.  
However, I'm having a problem setting it up the way I'd like and I 
figured that someone out there would have tried something similar to what 
I'm talking about and could help me out.

I'm wanting to change the (Active: #) to actually show what worlds are 
active.  At first I thought I could just change the value of the 'active' 
state, but that didn't work, so I came up with a better idea.

I tried to define some new variables for the status line.  Each variable 
being related to a world.  The idea was that the middle of my status bar 
would look like:

  <current world>______________B:____C:____M:____F:________(Log) etc...

And if there were any unred lines in the worlds corresponding to the 
B,C,M, or F... it would look like:

  <current world>______________B: 1__C:23__M: 4__F:________(Log) etc...

While I can get the first version up and running, I can't seem to get the 
variables to update properly...

Oh, and I was wondering how to redefine the 'time' format at the end of 
the status bar too.

It's a feature.  The More counter resets only for /dokey newline (i.e.,
you hit Return or Enter).  This is usually what is wanted; you probably
wouldn't want it to reset while you're in the middle of typing a line,
(including line editing keybindings) because your attention is on the
input window/line, and you may not have seen output that appeared while
you were typing.  TF doesn't try to decide when you want to reset and
when you don't; it only resets on newline.

If you want to reset the More counter at other times, you can
do it yourself with this /reset_more macro:

  /def reset_more = \
      /if (more & !moresize()) /set more=0%; /set more=1%; /endif

and use it like:

  /bind ^W = /reset_more%; /fg ->

To cause an update, you must change the value of the monitored variable.
But in this case, there's an extra twist:  if you simply have a '*' trigger
that changes the variable with nactive(), the nactive() will still return
the old value.  This is because triggers run _before_ the line is printed
or counted by nactive() (it has to be that way, so the triggers can apply
their hilites and gags).  So, you need to delay for an instant (e.g., with
/repeat -0 1) until the line makes it to the output queue.

First, stick "act_NAME:6" fields into status_fields, one for each world you
want to monitor.

Then define this:

  /def -Fp2147483647 -mglob -t'*' -hWORLD -q update_activity = \
      /repeat -w -0 1 
          /set act_$${world_name}=$$[strcat(substr($${world_name},0,1), ":", 
          nactive($${world_name}))]

A trigger on every line updates the field for the world.  A WORLD hook also
causes an update, so bringing a world into the foreground sets the field back
to 0.

Change %status_int_clock.

If I:
/SET status_int_clock ftime("%T", time())

The status_fields is still only getting updated every minute instead of 
every second as called for by the %T.

Thanks again for all your help and for adding the configurable status line.
This ROCKS!... btw, do the format tags like 'Br' in @more:8:Br support 
color?

Sounds like you've got much more of a handle on this status line
stuff that I have - would you mind posting/sharing your setups for
your status line??

Is there a reason why Tinyfugue likes to drop the link when lag occurs ?

When I use to use this program from my ISP shell account. It wouldn't
never
drop the connection unless the line was lagged for 10 minutes or so.

Now I don't know if this is because of the gnuwin32 or TF. Also I was
told
that the weird wrapping at the 80th column had something to do with the
way gnuwin32 was setup. But I dont know how to change the setup.
here is an example of what I am talking about
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Just say those lines are 80 columns long well when this happens you
get a blank line. instead of them appearing on just 2 lines. Each
line ends with a ^M. Also how come /sh command doesn't work ?

	Yup :)

/set status_fields= \

That's what mine looks like, and some of you may have noticed already 
that I changed the default messages for some things to give me more room 
on the status line. Not that I've figured out what to use it for yet, but 
it there when I need it. :)

Ok, I need sleep.

 I have some ideas/suggestions about the status line. As I use it to
mainly display various stats/spells/stuff my character is affected by etc,
I would need a few things.


 First, I would like to be able to insert fields next to each other
without any spaces in between. For example, when I want my <hp>/<hpmax> to
show, I have to define the variable as /set st_hpcm=%{sc_hp}/%{sc_hpmax},
and then display it in the status line as st_hp:7:BCblue.

 This works fine, but as it is, I can't change the color of the <hp>
value without changing the <hpmax> as well. I already have the triggers
made up to change the color depending on my current <hp> compared to
<hpmax>, but I would like this to change only the <hp> value.

 Currently I could make them as separate variables, but that would make it
look like 784_/_918 instead of 784/918, and would not only look silly but
also take a lot of space (which I don't have too much of).


 Second, I'd like to be able to put more than one dynamic field in the
status line. I have a current status_fields of

/set status_fields= \
 st_hpcm:8:Cblue \
 st_spcm:8:Cred \
 st_reg:4 \
 sc_spreg:4:B \
 cerup:3:BCmagenta \
 aurup:3:BCred \
 wwup:3:BCblue \
 st_eqon:4:BCred \
 p_attacker \
 @more:1:Br \
 @log:3 \
 @mail:3:BCred \
 insert:6:Cred \
 @clock

..producing the following status line:

918/918__753/753__Reg:_0____(C)_(A)_(W)_[EQ]_{very bad}_(L)_(M)_(O)_09:21

(I changed the status_int_mail/log/clock to suit my needs)

 What I'd like to do is make cerup/aurup/wwup dynamic, so that I would
save space for other stuff when they're not in use, i.e. (C) (A) and (W)
would all be placed in the first space not occupied by anything else, but
in the order I define them. (E.g. if (C) and (W) were in use, it would
look like (C)_(W), rather than (C)_____(W).)


 Also I'd like to be able to write text directly to the status line
without having to define a variable like "/set st_reg=Reg:" to get that
Reg: there.


 And last but not least, I'd like to be able to set isize to 0 and just
use the status line without the visual mode window, writing above the
status line rather than below it.


 Otherwise I think this status line thingy totally _ROX_!

I'm trying to simulate a floating point with a macro I'm working on.  
Everything works great for the most part, but the one problem is where, 
for example, I want to divide a number like 1016 by 1000 to get 1.016.  With 
mod() and any other way I try it, that 0 gets chopped off and it comes 
out as 1.16 instead, which can throw numbers off a bit.  Is there a way I 
can fix this to work properly somehow?

Thank you for your time...

The easiest answer by far is upgrade to the latest and greatest version
of Tinyfugue, which has floating point functions built in.

OK I have the following experimental (the first part works fine):

/SET act_Belteshazzar B:
/SET act_Cave C:
/SET act_Elmoondo E:
/SET act_Frenzy F:
/SET act_Measure M:

/SET status_fields \
  @more:1:r @world::BCyellow \
  act_Belteshazzar:5 \
  act_Cave:5 \
  act_Elmoondo:5 \
  act_Frenzy:5 \
  act_Measure:5 \
  @log:5 @mail:6 @clock:5:BCyellow

/SET status_int_more moresize() == 0 ? "" : "*"

Now what doesn't work is:

/DEF -hACTIVITY -p2147483647 -F -i -q update_activity = \
   /REPEAT -0 1 \
      /SET act_$${world_name}=$$[strcat(substr($${world_name},0,1), ":", \
      nactive($${world_name}))]

What I want is the <world_name> of the world the activity was in, but I 
get the <world_name> of %fg_world.  Any ideas?

I don't know for sure, but my guess would be that the /repeat is doing it.  It
executes after this hook is done, when the foreground world is the active world.

Use /repeat -w -0 1, like I did in my original post.  The -w makes the process
run in the world that was current when /repeat was called, instead of whatever
happens to be the foreground world at runtime.

I am VERY new to tinyfugue and need help with what seems easy to do, but I
cant seem to get it right.

The mud I play on is usually full and I must repeatedly reattempt to
login. What I want to do is make tf reconnect for me without me having to
type /connect over and over.

The message I get when the mud if full is
	The game is currently too busy. Try later.

Any help or suggestions would greatly be appreciated.

Try setting up a trigger on that message, to do a /connect <world>:

/def -p500 -Fq -w<world name> -msimple -t'The game is currently too busy. \
  Try later.' reconnect=/connect <world name>

That solution will retry instantly, which is a bad idea.  If everybody
did that, it would hammer the server quite hard.  The standard macro
"/retry <worldname>" will do this same thing, but will also pause 60
seconds between attempts, which is much nicer to both you and the server.

 I can't seem to get the negative field width to work (e.g. making the
contents of a field right-justified). According to the help files a
negative field width should do it, but after using the following format..

 /set status_fields blah:-4:B

..I get the following error msg:

% set: Field blah followed by garbage: -4:B

 Version is 4.0 alpha 3

Problem is, these string literals can't contain a : character. :(

I vaguely recall seeing a msg that someone had a Perl script to take a tf
generated log and edit it for posting as an HTML web page.  If you have that
script I'd like to get a copy, if I may.

Thank you.

Of course, if you have anything nifty, but don't have a web page, I'm

You can set up a trigger with -t'*chaos*', and have the body do a call
to fwrite().  (See /help)
I think there might also be other I/O routines newly added in 4.0 that you
can use for writing to files on a line-by-line basis.  (See /help tfio)

Figured out how to kick Win95's console windows so they allow scrollback.

You can get the self-installer, modified source, and patches at:
   http://www.geocities.com/soho/studios/8949/tf.html

Let me know how all of it works.

P.S.  Hawkeye:  Might it be possible to have these patches folded
      into the standard sources?  I know it adds a feature, but
      the changes are pretty minor, and in code that doesn't change
      a lot.  You should at least use the win32 call from output.c
      to set the screen dimentions.

when I do

and I am currently connected to a world, tf crashes. It's happened to me
under Linux and SunOS.

oops, forgot it was world_info(field) or world_info(world, field) before
someone decides to correct me on that. It still crashes when I use an

I've fixed this for the next version.  Of course, you shouldn't use invalid
field names anyway.

ie:

---- World Moo ----

---- World Mud ----
---- World Moo ----
---- World Mud ----
___>Moo
---- World Moo ----
---- World Mud ---- (status field still at default)

Ok, here's a wacky question I'm just gonna throw out there and hope that
maybe Ken can give me an answer to that will at least lead me in the right
direction. In my further development of the irc.tf script, I've been
trying to figure out DCC connections... mainly CHAT connections, as file
transfers seem pretty hopeless. I've found that it's rather simple to make
a connection if someone sends a chat request to me first.. all I need to
do is open up world to that person's site and the port their client is
listening on. However, I don't know of any way to have TF open up a port
itself and listen for a connection from elsewhere. Can this be done,
perhaps with some slight tweaking of the source if necessary?

Does anyone have example code how to use the tfio routines? I tried to 
find out myself with the help text and tf, but it does not seem to work.
What I want to do is quite simple: I want to open a file for writing 
special lines (like a partial log file). I did it with the log -w command 
up to now, and I don't like this version as it opens a dummy world just 
for logging.

Nope, this is not possible indeed. TF is a _client_, not a _server_.
To make TF work as a server would quite some deal - and it would
be in strong contrast with the general idea of a (MUD)client.

I suggest you write a completely different program - or a TF-
support program, that will open relay ports (i.e. listens on
a specific port and connects 2 clients together: send all
data that tf sends to the irc client end vice versa).

Just my opinion...

Greetings,
Johan

For a particular type of world I need to define some status
variables and keep their values current.  Now I've got all
the code working, but if I open more than one world of this
type at a time, everything clashes.

The obvious solution to this is to rename the variables from
'status' to 'status.${world_name}' or something similar, so 
a different one is automatically used for each world.  But
this:

   %{status.${world_name}}

is obviously not valid.

How do I evaluate a variable name with a variable as part
of it??

It was explained a while ago that that the -w option in /def does regexp
matches on the world name (if matching is set to regexp). I have worlds
such as CW, CW2, etc... If I make something as /def -wCW it is only
defined for world CW, doesn't work for the others, why is this?

Another question, if I have a highlight on a line and one of it's
attributes is bold, and a partial highlight matching the same line
sometimes, why does the partial highlight become bold even if I didn't set
it so?

Also, is there any way to include \ in a regexp? I have tried \\, but that
don't work.

thanks alot in advance...
tf kicks serious ass!

Oh yes, I am using the latest alpha.

I now put some of my code on a WWW page:
   http://www.ph-cip.uni-koeln.de/~dittmar/tf/

It's not too much as most things I use are in one single big file, but I 
don't want to give out the whole file as my "enemies" in the mud might
use the knowledge about my triggers to tick me out. Perhaps, if I have
a lot of time, I'll put some more code there, a cleaned version of the
command file for my character ...

In such cases I use things like
  /eval ... %%{status.${world_name}} ...
I don't know if this might help for the status line though, as you would 
have to change the status line at each change of worlds perhaps.

   Has anyone managed to get locales to work with tf? I can't get 8-bit
characters to work in my computer or in a unix machine at university.

  In my computer I can't even set the LC_CTYPE variable, it says 'Invalid
locale for LC_CTYPE.'. Setting LC_TIME says 'LC_TIME category set to "fi"
locale.'

  In the unix machine at university I can set LC_CTYPE correctly but it
still won't work, I can't type any 8-bit characters. And I think that the
unix admins at university have installed locales correctly. And istrip is
"off" in both cases.

  What could be the problem?

You don't happen to be on a SUN system using Solaris? TF has problems with
locale's on such a system (and that things like CTRL-O hanging it).

Nope. My machine is running Linux, and the machines at university are
running Digital unix.

It compiles, it starts, but it then does not allow space in the input.
On that, it just beeps.

TinyFugue version 4.0 alpha 3.
Built for SunOS Generic_103640-05 5.5.1

I will now try compiling it with hard-coded vt100.

I think it goes by what your %matching is, not the -m of the trigger. Or
maybe -w only does simple matching. You could try it with glob matching
just to be sure... (-w'CW*')

because attributes are combined in a line. Maybe adding a n or @{n} in
there would help if you don't want that.

I've been having the same problems (in 4.0 at least), when I want to
include a literal "\$" and use "\\$$" it doesn't like that, no matter what
combination of \s and $s I use. Try \\\ if \\ won't work. Or maybe it's 
\\\\.

If someone does do this, could they perhaps leave a debugging option for
logging? And perhaps have the ability to connect to the 2nd site and
relay..? (Yes, adds a bit, but have needed such on and off for debugging
and if someone is going to program it...)

Aggreed, tho the ability to accept connections would be usefull for
any number of things...
Granted things would be somewhat cleaner if there was a universal
threading setup and we could use that... (Name lookups, blocking connects
for the better error messages with each world having its own thread, etc)

I /set matching=glob, my worlds are CW, CW1, etc and -w'CW*' generates the
error that there is no such world CW*.

Here is one of my situations with this... If my mob highlight matches a
line, that line will be in bold red. But this highlight is fall through so
that my partials can do stuff like match (Invis) and make that part cyan.
This works, however the (Invis) is not cyan, but bold cyan... Is there any
way to not have this attribute addition affect? It seems that when a n
highlight is added with another highlight it's the other highlight that
wins.

Same story, any combination I have tried of \s will not give me a literal
\ in a regexp.

The -w option always uses 'simple' matching.  It is -T (world type) that uses
%matching or the -m option.

I have not had a problem using \\ or \\$ in a regexp in 4.0a3.
Try /set pedantic=on and reload the file, to see what kind of output you get.

It was explained wrong, then.  The argument to /def -w must match exactly,
it never uses globs or regexps.

Overlapping attributes are added together.

In a case like /def -t"...", there are two levels of escaping required.

First, the quotes for the -t"..." option allow \" (for literal ") or \\
(for literal \) inside the string.  Any other use of \ is in a quoted
string is technically incorrect (tf will usually do what you expect with
those other uses, but you shouldn't depend on it).

Second, metacharacters in a regexp must be prefixed with \, and to produce
a literal \, you must use \\.

So, to get a literal \ in a regexp you must use \\, and then to get that
literal \\ in a quoted string you must use \\\\.  Therefore a regexp trigger
on a literal \ would be defined like this:

  /def -t"\\\\" ...

Never say "latest", give the version number.

It seems to be some sort of colour matching - if two colours both
match a certain area, tf tries to display some combination.  And
combining colours usually comes out hideously, from what I've found.

To get around it, I've ended up doing some really weird stuff like
writing two triggers that match the same part, but only highlight
different areas of it, like this:

/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush" -F -P1Cblue -t'(\().* looked at you.*\)$' TINY.MUSHlook
/def -p100 -T"tiny.mush" -F -P1Cblue -t'\(.* (looked at you.*\))$' TINY.MUSHlook2

It's something that I personally hate.  I'd MUCH rather have the
last colour be the one that was used.  Or even the first colour,
as long as it's defined I can juggle priorities to change the order
so I get the colours I want.

This is going to sound really dumb.  How do I -end- an /eval? 
(I shouldn't program when I'm tired).

For example this:

/def -T"irc" say = \
   /eval /if (%%{channel_${world_name}} !~ "") \
      /eval /send -w PRIVMSG %%{channel_${world_name}} :%%*%; \
      /if (irc_display_mode =~ "mud") \
         /trigger LOCAL  You say, "%*"%; \
      /else \
         /trigger LOCAL <%{irc_nick}> %*%; \
      /endif %;\
   /else \
      /trigger LOCAL %{irc_error_prefix} You're not on a channel!%; \
   /endif

I need the two /eval's to fix the variable names in those lines, but
they mess up the rest of the function too unless I double all the 
remaining %%s - which I don't want to do.

You end an /eval just like you end any other command; in macro body, you
do it with "%;".  Each "%" you intend to be part of the /eval'd text
needs to be written as "%%"; that means "%;" must be written "%%;".
Your second /eval doesn't belong there, and every "%" you have needs to
be changed to "%%", except for the "%%*" which you got right.

Style note:  "%" is not necessary in expressions, and since it often leads
to confusion when multiple eval levels are involved, it's best to avoid it:

  /def -T"irc" say = \
     /eval /if (channel_${world_name} !~ "") \
  ...

You can avoid the /eval ugliness when using /if or /while, by using /test
instead of (), because /test evals its arguments:

  /def -T"irc" say = \
     /if /test channel_${world_name} !~ ""%; \
        /eval /send -w PRIVMSG %%{channel_${world_name}} :%%*%; \
        /if (irc_display_mode =~ "mud") \
           /trigger LOCAL  You say, "%*"%; \
        /else \
           /trigger LOCAL <%{irc_nick}> %*%; \
        /endif %;\
     /else \
        /trigger LOCAL %{irc_error_prefix} You're not on a channel!%; \
     /endif

I forgot the /then.  When you use "/if command" instead of "/if (expression)",
you need /then.

         /if /test channel_${world_name} !~ ""%; /then \

Still doesn't work.  With that, I get

% say: unexpected /ELSE in IF block

And if I cut it down to just

>   /def -T"irc" say = \
>      /if /test channel_${world_name} !~ ""%; \

I get "% say: unexpected /ENDIF in IF block".

Why's it unexpected??

It works just fine for me right out of the box on SunOS 5.5.1 with gcc.

Most odd. That is exactly as I do it, the only change I did to the
unix/Config was to where it installs.

This makes me wonder. I use the same configuration, and it works fine ...

According to Mats Henrik Carlberg:
[Someone having problems with locale]

I have the same problem under FreeBSD. For some reason, Ken rejected a
suggestion of having a variable so that you could FORCE tf into 8bit mode,
since you know your screen can handle it, and you want to be able to use
your national characters (something like "set force_eightbit=true").

I ended up doing a quick and dirty hack on TF 35b1, which I'm still using,
where I just edited all the places that did checks to allow anything with
the 8bit set. It works pretty well, and I haven't had time to do a nicer
solution and submit to Ken.

As I said, it's not pretty, but for anyone not interested in code quality,
but just wants 8bit to work (better at least) it's available for download on:

 Enclosing something in "'s is supposed to make it appear as written into
the status line. Still, the ":" gives the error message

% set: Field " followed by garbage: "

 which means it still tries to apply this as a normal variable.

 I can get around this by creating a dummy variable, e.g.

/set dummy_1=:

 and then inserting that variable where I want the :.. But this is kinda
messy if I want lots of them..


 Also I haven't heard from you others, anyone else having problems with
the negative field width? I found a way to get round it using pad(), but
that gets messy too, would be a lot easier to do it in the status line
itself.

PS. Is there a way to turn off the automatic pedantic checking of triggers
the first time I start up tf and uses a trigger? I know I have some stuff
in for example my promt hook which could be more clearly used with {...},
but I know they work anyway and don't really care to see an "useless"
error message each time I start up.. (And yes, I do have pedantic=off)

I don't know if there's a way to get around it, but I'd suggest to change 
these things step by step. I had some things which were not wrong, but no 
longer directly supported, in my tf code. Then 4.0 came and they changed 
from not supported to wrong ...

Just in case this is the subject I started, I compiled tf fine
on Solaris 2.5.1 and it seems to be working fine. I used gcc also.

These have both been fixed for the next version.

No.  Currently, with pedantic=on, you will get the warning every time,
and with pedantic=off you will get the warning once (the first time).
Maybe I'll change it.

 Loading my triggers while having pedantic=on produces a lot of spam. This
mainly because of two reasons.
 The first, which are fully correct, are the warnings about macros without
names (I've been lazy a lot :)).
 The second, however, are the warnings about \ in the triggers. For
example, the following trig

/def -Fp1 -aBb -aCblue -mglob -t'\*\*\* You have NEW mail in the Post
Office. \*\*\*' newmaillite

 gives the following error/warning message (6 times)

% .putros, line 960: def: warning: the only legal escapes within this
quoted string are \\ and \'. \\* is the correct way to write a literal \*
inside a quoted string.

 Now this would be a very good warning if I had intended to have a literal
\* in the trig, but when the effect I want is a literal *, I use the \ to
escape it. And therefore get a dummy warning.
 I could of course write it like [*], but I'd like to be sure this is the
way to do it before I rewrite all my triggers..

The warning is about the literal \* in the QUOTED STRING, not in the GLOB.
To get a literal * in a GLOB, you need to use \*.  But to get THAT into
a QUOTED STRING, you need to use \\*, like the warning says.

That works too, and in nested expansions, is often the easiest way to
avoid the \ confusion.

I was quite confused by this error message too. What you want, is \* in 
the quoted string (the part between the ') to trigger a * in the text 
coming from your MU*. To make the \* appear in the quoted string, you 
have to escape the backslash, which means you'll have -t'\\*\\*\\* You ...'

As I said, I was quite confused when I read such warnings, and tested 
long (rewrite the macro, reload the file ...) until I came to this 
interpretation of the problem.

 Yeah I guess the warning is right, and I guess I'm not supposed to keep
the pedantic on at all times, so I don't have to be annoyed by the spam.
:) Just thought I'd remark on it since I found it :)

 Ok, so I guess I'll rewrite my trigs then.. Actually I just named them
all after seeing a few screenfuls of warning spam I figured maybe it's
time to get it done ;)


 Oh yes, btw, while I'm at it making your lives hard, I noticed Insert
toggling with pedantic on gives a nice little warning message..:

 When toggling on:

% status_var_insert: warning: text string value used in numeric context

 When toggling off:

% @test: warning: text string value used in numeric context

 Nothing important, but figured I'd mention it nevertheless :)

 It seems you're right, but the funny thing is that when I do two triggers
like this

 /def -F -aBCred -t'*putt \* blah*' blaheej
 /def -F -aBCred -t'*putt \\* blah*' blahooj
 
and then do a /list, they both show up as follows

% 8945: /def -Fp1 -aB -aCred -t'*putt \\* blah*' blaheej
% 8946: /def -Fp1 -aB -aCred -t'*putt \\* blah*' blahooj

 So the only difference is that with pedantic=on, I get a warning message
when creating the blaheej trigger.

 But still, both of them works, so I guess I'll just add that other
backslash to get rid of the warnings.. Thanks for the info.

Lo, all...

I'm trying to figure out how to create a macro that will make it easier
for me to issue the command "&instructions here=\" on a MUX.  I've tried
the following, without any success:

/def inst = &instructions here=\

and

/def inst = &instructions here=\\

Any ideas why I cannot get this to work?

That one is a bug, and I've already fixed it for the next version.
(in 40a3, you'll get that spurious warning whenever you use a "special
variable" with the value 0 or "" in a numeric context).

The first one only works because so many people made the same mistake
that I made it a special case to interpret it the way the user probably
meant it.  But it is still technically incorrect, and the /list output
above shows the correct way to do it.

I have a little 'problem' here...

The next 'error' comes along at the first run of a macro..

% delta_score: warning: %... substitution in expression can be confusing.
Try using {...} instead.

/def -mregexp -p2 -aB -ag -t'^\[Hp (.*)  Fp (.*)\]' delta_score = \
/set current_fp=%{P2}%;\
/set current_hp=%{P1}%;\
/echo -aB [Hp: $[%{P1}] ($[%{current_hp} - %{old_hp}])  Fp: $[%{P2}]
($[%{current_fp} - %{old_fp}])]%;\
/set old_fp=$[%{current_fp}]%;\
/set old_hp=$[%{current_hp}]%;

I can't figure out wherre that error comes from.. 

Mad.

It's not an error, just a warning..

Don't put $[] around variable references.
When using variables in expressions, just use the name, with no % or {}
(unless you are using a numbered variable, where you need {1})

You used %{P2} correctly above, so on the underlined line, you should have:

/echo -aB [Hp: %P1 ($[current_hp - old_hp])  Fp: %P2
(and likewise on all the /set lines)

Check out /help substitution and /help expressions for how variable
references work in and outside of expressions.

Hello,

I tried to compile the tf-40a3 on an AIX 3.2.5  and IRIX 5.3 ,
but on both plattforms the follwing error message appears:

	make -f ../unix/unix.mak CC='gcc' CFLAGS='-O ' makehelp
Make: Line 67: syntax error

After comment this line in unix.mak, the compiler works fine.
Sorry but I can't figure out which versions of make are installed.

Something I whipped up in a fit of boredom. Dunno if anyone has already
produced something like this, as I don't follow the archives (though, I
don't know why anyone would want to create something like this in the
first place). Just removes all lines matching <pattern> from your input
history, using %{matching} style if none is specified with the -m option.
Enjoy, let me know how it works and if you can find a use for (or nasty
bugs in) it.

Hi,

I have a question for the gurus here ;-)

There was a question about disabling and enabling commands some weeks ago.
I read the answers again, and found out there was only one solution 
telling to use /edit -c0 and /edit -c100.

Some time ago I heard you should better undef the command and define it 
again later. Of course it would be a lot of work if I had a special 
undefine/define command set for every command, therefore I tried to code 
a more complicated thing.

I want it to work like that: If I want to disable one command, it writes 
this command into one variable (which is part of an array of variables), 
then undefines the command. Later, if I tell tf to enable the command 
again, it checks this array, reads the definition of the command and with 
it defines the command again.

Somehow I don't get it to work:

/set _disableTop=0

; this part works quite well:
/def disable = \
    /if /ismacro %{1} %; /then %;\
        /set _disableTop=$[_disableTop+1] %;\
        /set _disableName__%{_disableTop}=%{1} %;\
        /eval /set _disableBody__%{_disableTop}=$(/cddr $(/list -i - %{1})) %;\
        /undef %{1} %;\
    /else %;\
        /echo -e %%% macro %{1} not definded %;\
    /endif

; here's a problem inside:
/def enable = \
    /let _lauf=1 %;\
; somehow it does NOT see that the contense of _disableName__1 and the 
; command line parameter %{1} are identical (I tested it with one disabled
; command ...  What am I doing wrong?
    /while /test ((%%{_lauf} <= %%{_disableTop})&(%%{_disableName__%{_lauf}} !/ "%%{1}")) %;\
        /do /test ++_lauf%;\
    /done %;\
    /if (_lauf>_disableTop) \
        /echo -e %%% macro %{1} not found %;\
    /else %;\
        /eval /eval %%{_disableBody__%{_lauf}} %;\
        /while (_lauf<_disableTop) \
            /eval /set _disableName__%{_lauf}=%%{_disableName__$[_lauf+1]} %;\
            /eval /set _disableBody__%{_lauf}=%%{_disableBody__$[_lauf+1]} %;\
            /test ++_lauf%;\
        /done %;\
        /set _disableTop=$[_disableTop-1]%;\
    /endif

; this part works as it should:
/def echoDisabled = \
    /let _lauf=1 %;\
    /echo %;\
    /while (_lauf<=_disableTop) %;\
        /eval /echo %%{_disableBody__%{_lauf}} %;\
        /echo %;\
        /test ++_lauf%;\
    /done


Any help appreciated!

Okay, I know I -shouldn't- be having this trouble, but maybe I'm just a 'tard.

/recall # /5 ^(Siefre|Elaina)

produces nothing

/recall /5 ^(Siefre|Elaina)

produces five lines of text.

But # -is- supposed to yield line numbers in the display, right? Or am I
misreading the helpfile? How do I -get- line numbers if this isn't the case?

 I use a different way which I think works quite fine. I simply put an /if
string in the beginning of triggers I want to be able to disable. (E.g.
/if (test=1)) Then I just make a send hook to change that string to 0 or
1, depending on if I want to disable/enable it. To make it more
complicated you could add an /if string in the beginning of the send hook
to check for the current state of the string and always changing it to the
opposite, thus using the same send hook (e.g. command) to enable/disable
the trigger).

 Hope I made myself clear enuff :)

I haven't tested it yet (I read my E-mail before I MUD), but if you remove
the space between the # and /5, this should work just fine.

In other words, write this line as:

		/recall #/5 ^(Siefre|Elaina)

Hello again everyone.  I've been away from the list for a couple of
months working on the BeOS port of TinyFugue.  IT's coming along 
slowly as select() support on file descriptors is terrible and I 
am porting a better select() :-(.

In the meantime Ken has made excellent strides on the Win32/CygWin 
version. <clap>

What I'm trying to say is that, I'm sure someone else has asked for 
an easy install and support for changing the Window Title.  Since 
4.0 adds support for configurable status bars, I have added the 
world name as the Console Title.  The support was easy, however 
it requires a header file from a Win32 API, (wincon.h).  Since it 
is illegal to distribute said header file, I am building a binary 
distribution complete with InstallShield installer.  

It will be available in the next 24 hours and I will follow this 
up with an address you may get it from.

Hi,

I received an answer telling it would be easier to name the variables 
with the names of the disabled commands. This would, as M. Atlan 
Corpeleijn wrote (and I'm sure he's right) be faster and easier code.

Still it would not do what I want. For example I'd like to define one 
command, test it, save it (by disabling it) and then overwrite it with a 
newer version. And, which is more important, I need the possibility to 
list all disabled commands. After 5-10 hours of playing, I usually don't 
remember all the things I did ...

So does anyone see what I did wrong in the code I wrote?

Susan Dittmar

Hi, 

I want TF to write certain lines of text to disk, where an external
program has to analyse the text immediately.

First I tried 'fwrite'. This worked fine so far, but had the disadvantage
of a relative large overhead, because it openes and closes the file for
every line of text it writes.

Therefore I tested 'tfwrite'. The overhead was reduced to a minimum,
because I had to open and close the file only one time each evening.

The problem is that output with 'tfwrite' is buffered. The whole text is
buffered in memory until the file is closed or the (relative large)
buffer is full. Thus the external program can't analyse the 'written' text
immediately, but has to wait, until the internal buffer is flushed.

One possibility is to close the file each time I want the external program
to analyse the new text. This would be the same as using 'fwrite'. The
other possibility is to cry for a new command ;-)

Therefore I would like to suggest a new command 'tfflush(handle)'. The
only task of this command is to flush the internal buffers for file
(handle) immediately and write the text to disk without closing the file.


Bye,

Stephan Lichtenhagen

This is from Mitja Sarp <mitja@ludd.luth.se>, he wanted me to post it
here:

trailing spaces should not be truncated from variable names, or there
should be at least some kind of way to add them literally to strings, good
example is this irc-like tab behaviour

/def -mregexp -t"tells you '" catchteller = /set teller=%PL
/def -b^I bindtab = /grab tell %teller

on mudoutput

Tomba tells you 'tmpfoo'

it should put "Tomba " in %teller and when you press tab it puts 
"tell Tomba " on the commandline, but now it truncates the trailing space
a very ugly solution would be to have a trivial character after "%teller "
and a quoted backspace, but that looks real silly

since almost all muds cut the trailing spaces, you wouldn't lose anything
on having them in variables, another solution would be somehow quoted
"hard" spaces, like C-v <space>, shrug

I have the same problem myself but I got used to pressing space after
pressing tab that it doesn't matter anymore. What caught my eye was that
irc-like tab behaviour. My version of the same is:

I have yet to implement multi person tells and ignored tells and

The new tf4.0a3 status line is much much more usable than the first
version. Thank you for that. But I can't believe I'm the only one who
wants to be able to change the attributes for the text according to
value and have multiple attributes in one value.

An excerpt from status.tf file.

/set status_var_st_hp=strcat(((st_hp<st_hpmax)?"h":"H"),pad(st_hp,4))

As you can see by investigating that cryptic expression that I have my
hp indicated like this when it is at maximum:

H1034

And when it's below maximum:

h 676

Now what I would like to have and what I had in my prompt before status
line is that I could have colors indicating the same thing. ie. Green
when hp at max, cyan when less than 100 hp below max, blue when it's
just below max and red when it's less than 100 and purple when it's
negative.

An idea might be to implement the same system as in the echo command
which I think is wonderful.

/set status_field=st_hp:5:r ...

/set
status_var_st_hp=strcat("@{Ccyan}H",((st_hp<st_hpmax)?"@{Cred}":"@{Cgree
n}"),st_hp)

And other things about the status line.
Getting a space in there with attributes:
/set st_space= dummy
/set status_fields=sumthing st_space:1:r anotherthing
Kludgelike.

And you can't have variable width fields if you wan't to have the whole
status line in reverse or something like that.

Hi,

as I posted some days ago I was working on a set of commands to disable 
and enable triggers by actually undefining them and keeping them in 
variables until I need them again.

With the great help of M. Atlan Corpeleijn <matt@crowley.plantijn.nl> 
the work has been (hopefully) finished. I put the (hopefully) working 
commands on 
    http://www.ph-cip.uni-koeln.de/~dittmar/tf
for everyone who might feel the wish to use them or use the technique 
for other commands.

   Susan Dittmar

Something like this should work. I didn't test it though :) But I do use
thise colourizing trick in some of my other macro's, and also for some of
my delay triggers.

Mad.

If status_var_* allowed partial attribute codes, the first solution
would be just fine.  The problem is, they're not allowed.

You can have spaces in variables and expressions.  The ticky part is avoiding
the space-stripping of macro body parsing.

  /def -mregexp -t"tells you '" catchteller = /set teller=%PL
  /def -b^I bindtab = /test input(strcat("tell ", teller, " "))

Many (/many/) months ago, I requested some good logging macros, and people
answered.  Unforunately, since then, I've lost said macros.  I'm using
3.5b1, and I'm looking for the following features:

When I connect to a world, it starts logging (-w, of course) to the file
'date-world_name', where date is in the format Day:Month:Year.  For
example:  02:12:97-LA

Oh, and, each time it starts logging, I want it to add to the file
something like '!-- Started logging at HH:MM:SS.'  (In 24 hr mode.)

I also want it to write any input I send to the world, with a > preceeding
it.  So a sample log would look like this ... 

!-- Started logging at 12:01:01.
Brack says, "Bah."
> `brack Feh.
You say to Brack, "Feh."
!-- Started logging at 13:01:01.
Brack says, "Buh."

I know I need to use a fwrite() setup for the second, but I just don't
have the coding expertise (or whatever) to pull it (any of it, really) off
successfully. So, any help anybody can give would be appreciated. 

PS:  One thing to keep in mind is that I might start logging at, say,
11:59, but go until about 2 am -- so figuring out the date for each
fwrite() wouldn't work. =)

Some of you that use TinyFugue for WinNT or 95 may get incorrect
wrapping
when something of 80 columns long gets displayed the fix for this that
no one seem
to be able to help me fix. So I assuming noone has had a fix for this.

Anyways what you do is set the win32 console to 81 columns wide for the
buffer
only, keep the window with to 80. Set the wrapsize variable to 80 and
set wrap=on
this will fix it for people using the latest version from
http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Studios/8949/tf.html in NT you need
to go to the system icon in the control panel add a environment variable

TFGEOM and set the value to 81x25
for win95 users goto autoexec.bat and set it there.
Then TF will automaticaly set the properties to the win32 console.

> Anyone having information of arrays and structures in TF?

They are a little easier to do in tf4.0 taking advantage of the new
macros-as-function calling convention.  Basically the trick is to make
variables named foo_1, foo_2, etc to simulate an array named foo.

Here is a quicky package I wrote the other night to do simple db like
operations.  Not really documented, cope.

The set_info and get_info functions are the easiest to use as
structure/arrays, but require tf4.0.  They are currently set to be world 
specific (ie, array named `foo' on world X is different than array named 
`foo' on world Y), but you can probably see how to easily change that.

The other functions allow you to do things like define "variables" that
are world specific or global, or world specific but have a default
value, etc.

To do array/structure things you can do:

/def set_age =\
    /let who=%{1}%;\
    /let age=%{2}%;\
    /test set_info("PLAYER", who, "AGE", age)

/def get_age =\
    /let who=%{1}%;\
    /echo $[get_info("PLAYER", who, "AGE")

For arrays just use a number instead of a string like "AGE".  For
example, it's really easy to make things like a linked list package on
top of these routines.

The bug here is in how /grab is defined:
/list -i grab
% 25582: /def -i grab = /@test kblen() & dokey("dline")%; /input %*


Change it to:
/def -i grab = /@test kblen() & dokey("dline")%; /@test input({*})

That's part of the problem, but you'd still lose spaces when the body of
bindtab uses /grab.  You need to redefine /grab as you did above (and as
4.0 alpha 4 will), AND use /test grab(strcat("tell ", teller, " ")).

I'm resending this because I accidentally sent my other posts in a bad

Use ftime() to do that.
/def -Fp100 -h'connect' connectlog = /log -w
$[ftime("%m/%d/%y",time())-${world_name}

although I think it was suggested that you use %y/%m/%d so you can sort
them properly.

you could do that as well, although it might be a little slower.

you could conceivably stuff the filenames in variables such as
logname_${world_name}, although opening separate files with tfopen() could
work, too.

ok, I know I sent those three messages wrong. I just didn't realize it

Hi all.

I have this little problem with prompts. Even if I define a prompt hook,
it still happens that I get a piece of text with the prompt in front of
it, which causes a number of triggers to screw up when I don't add a *
before it. This rather sucks, since I'd be much happier using -msimple
trigs instead of globs and/or regexps...

Anyone has a solution for this problem?

Mad.

When the mud sends an untermined prompt quickly followed by a line of text,
there is absolutely no way to separate the two.  This is a design flaw in 
mud prompts.  You may be able to reduce this by lowering prompt_usec, but
you can never get rid of it completely as long as lp=on.

The only complete solution is to convince the mud admin to add the GOAHEAD
or EOR prompt terminators as described in tf's "/help prompt protocol".
Then, you can run tf with lp=off.

the /sh command for Tinyfugue under WinNT doesn't work.
When i try stuff like /sh dir, simple stuff it says failier ?
the /sh command is a pretty useful tool, too usefull for it to
just say ok it doesn't work we dont care about it and get rid
of it kinda thing :)

Also how hard is it to code in a command that can call the
scroll back features in win32 consoles while in full screen ?

It won't happen again.  The list filter now rejects text/html bodies.  It used 
to reject multipart/mixed which blocked messages with attachments which helped 
older stuff which had the main part in text/plain and an attachment with the 
text/html version, but apparently there is now some braindead software that ONLY 
sends html.  In any case, list policy is to allow only pure text messages, no 
uuencode, no attachments, no vcards, no stupid microsoft gibberish at the end of 
messages, etc.

Hi there,

I have the following commands and outputs, that I want to handle in one command.

1. The mud-command 'people' gives me the following sample output:

123.45.67.890   Dummyname      66   1 D     +room/dummyname/somewhat/room_1

2. The unix-command 'host' gives me the hostname to an ip-number.

123.45.67.890.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain name pointer blah.fasel.org

What I want is to combine the two commands in one, so i want to get

> new-people

123.45.67.890   Dummyname     blah.fasel.org
...

Anyone an idea how to do that ?
I have created many triggers for my mud, but i never have tried to combine
a mud command with a unix-command because i don't know to put the output of 
unix-command into mud-definitions...


Freddy

	With out really the time right now to check into this 
thouroughly, I would suggest making sure you have the latest version and 
then read up on the %| (pipe) command. I think this will at least be able 
to point you into the right direction.

I've been using TF for about a year now, and I think it is a great
product.  I primarily use library files written by a friend of mine,
though I have written some original stuff.  I'm interested in
learning more about how the programming/scripting works so I can really write
stuff the way it should be written, etc.  I've looked the help files
over quite a bit, but I do better with some examples to go along with...
does anyone know of any web pages, etc., with good samples a beginner
can look at?

(I'm not a beginner to programming, just to TF's particular way of
doing things.)

Many thanks...

I've got some bits and pieces that might help to look at on
my web page at:

http://www.tertius.net.au/~gossamer/geek/tf/

They're generally fairly short little bits, so they should be
easier to learn off.  I found it's a lot easier to figure from
short things, I started off trying to figure it from the library
files which was a PAIN.

I have a littile file I made that does the following

prompt *^H>

^b in the file is really the character code control H
it says in tinyfugue if you make it so the prompt has a * followed
by a backspace you can turn lp=off, but this hasb't been working
correctly. Also when I try to embed ansi codes using ^Z it doesn't
seem to work either.

This turns out to be a particular bad suggestion in this case.  First of 
all %| won't help you here particuarly, and secondly it'll point you
encourage a wild goose chase through some of the more complicated parts
of tf4.0.

Short answer, use /quote -S to call out to host.

Something like this (which is just to give an idea):

/def -t'^([12]?[0-9]?[0-9]\\.[12]?[0-9]?[0-9]\\.[12]?[0-9]?[0-9]\\.[12]?[0-9]?[0-9]) +([^ ]* +)' match_people =\
    /let ip=%{P1}%:\
    /let hostname=%;\
    /let who=%{P2}%;\
    /quote -S /collect_host_name !host %{ip}%;\
    /substitute -- %{ip} %{who} %{hostname}

/def collect_host_name =\
    /test hostname := %5

You'll notice that I collect the extra spaces after the player name with
``([^ ]* +)'' so that the hostname can be indented correctly.  You could
also just go with [0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+ for the ip address
if you want too.

A simple question:

Is there an easier way to replace all occurances of a space in a string
with an underscore than the use of strchr with strcat and substr?

Mad.

Yes... I do stuff like this:

/def -F -mregexp -t'\\<(.*)mv\\>'    remove_prompt1 = /substitute %PR

This works assuming your prompt looks something like this:

<171hp 145m 191mv>

Just have to change the -t portion for other types of prompts.

Make sure you add a -p10000 or some other ridiculously high priority so
that the substitution is triggered first.

Is there any way of getting TF to suppress your host and login name, so
MUDS etc can't see where you are coming from and from what login?

This is not something that TF has any control over.

The MUD server needs to know your host IP address or it cannot send
anything back to you.

The name related to your IP address is obtained by looking up the address
in the DNS.

Your real user ID/name is only normally available to the remote server if
the machine at your end is running 'identd' and the MUD server asks it to
confirm who you are.

There is alot more to this, but it is not something that needs to be on
the mailing list.

I hope this answers your question.

I can't figure this out, it's probably something obvious. What I want to
do is make a regexp that matches a line NOT containing a certain word or
sequence of characters... For example, I want to make a regexp matching:

Caelum is here, fighting a large hill.

But NOT matching:

A large hill is here, fighting Caelum.

So it would match strings not containing "A ".
How do I do this?

Thanks.

assuming it would only start with "A " as you said, try..
-t'^([^A ]+) is here, fighting (.*)\\.'
which assumes you wanted something with the who fighting who part, but that
might break if someone has a A in their name. Or you could always just match
the "is here fighting" part and do
/if ({p0}!/"A *") ... /endif
in your macro body.

I'm having troubles with an LP mud and prompts.  It's not a game
mud or anything, so the prompts are totally unecessary.  What I
want to happen is basically catch them and disgard them.

After looking all over the documentaion I'm confused as all hell.

I've defined the world as type lpp.mush -and- set lp to off manually,
AND set prompt_usec to some rediculously high value and it's STILL
pulling out half lines all over the place and pretending they're
prompts.  I don't WANT that!

I'm in a slow link in Australia, so there's often stupid amounts
of lag.

I thought of just setting it to a different world type but I like
the auto-login.

I just want to get the prompts pulled out of the input stream and
disguarded.  Nothing else!

Oh, and I can manually set the prompt value, so I've set it to
*{backspace} which is - I thought - what TF likes best.

I'm getting awfully frustrated ...

OK, I've been reading the help files, and I just do not understand how to
do this.

On a MUD I play on, I am given a prompt:

<3097Hp 143Ma 480Mv>

I want these three stats (Hits, Mana, Move) to be on the TF status bar,
and to supress the prompt (Its ugly). 

How would I do this? 

Jamie

The ansi in cygwin32 is not as good as real ansi color.
It doesn't support flashing, and I do notice sometimes
it messes up as well if typing really fast. I assume ansi
will get claened up more as time passes. Unfortunaly under
NT we can't use ansi.sys because its not supported by 
win32 console apps.

Here's what I made:

/def -F -aBCgreen -mregexp -t'([^A][^ ])+ is here[.,]' player_hilite1

But unfortunately it still matches strings that begin with "A ". The /if
seems to be the cleanest solution, but I see no way to apply it to
hilites.

Thanks again,

I seem to have deleted the beginning of the thread, but if you want
to tag things that start with "A <text> is here...", then I'd think 
it'd just be:

/def -F -aBCgreen -mregexp -t'^A (.*) is here, fighting (.*)' player_hilite1

That should grab both the name of the player here, and the thing they're
fighting.

Caveat: This is just from egrep and mutt regexp work, not TF.  I MUX, I
        don't MUD. :)

(side note: Don't use (.*) at the end of a regexp. You don't need it. Use %pr
instead.)

It was actually a rather tricky one, he wanted something that DIDN'T match
"A "
at the beginning of a string. But since the name of the person isn't needed in
the trigger, I think you can do this with two globs at different priorities:

/def -mglob -p2 -t'A * is here, fighting *' player_hilite1
/def -mglob -Fp1 -aBCgreen -t'* is here, fighting *' player_hilite2

This relies on the first trigger not falling through though, so it should have
a low priority.
If you need them to fall through, maybe you could find some combination of
green and whatever attributes that produces no color?

this does the same thing so it might not be the answer you're looking for, but
you can get away with
/test tr("a a","a_a",whatever)
(the a's are just to pad the space so it gets included; it might be more
efficient to change them to a character that hardly gets used)

Actually:

/def -F -aBCgreen -mregexp -t'^([^A]|A[^ ]).+ is here[.,]' player_hilite1

This highlights everything that either:

(1) does not begin with A -OR-
(2) begins with A, but is followed by something other than a space

as long as it has 'is here' followed by a period or comma somewhere in the
line.

This means:

A tree is here, leafing quickly. --> will not be highlighted

Bunky the cheese doll is here. --> will be highlighted

Pooterbeast the Grand Cataclysm hates you. I bet so does everyone who is here.
--> will be highlighted.

Still not quite what you want, I'm guessing, but I'm not sure if you'll be
able to -get- what you want without a tighter control on your patterns.

I see how that should work, but unfortunately I have not been able to
pursuade it to do so. Using this pattern strings such as:

A Citizen's Board is here.

still get highlighted. I have no clue why.

I'd ask that you _not_ use PGP/MIME to send messages to this list...
first of all, I'm not sure how those will show up for anyone who
doesn't have PGP/MIME; secondly, even though I have it and can read
it fine, it fills up my attachments directory with a bunch of things
I have to remember to hold on to if I want to keep the messages.  I
fully support using PGP, but this part of it is still a bit of a
bother to work with, IMHO.

Hello all.

Is it at all possible to retain colouring in lines when they are being
used in a trigger? For example to echo a colourized line to another world?

Mad.

Not really. A trigger doesn't affect the coloring in a line, and most muds
don't allow you to just send ansi color codes, but have their own color
codes that you have to use. You can /echo lines with color, using the same
syntax you use for highlights, for example:

/echo -aBCgreen Blah!

will echo Blah! in bright green to the screen.

I would like to take a string and reverse the letters in it.

For example:
/rev very simple string
returns:
gnirts elpmis yrev

I imagine it can be done using strcat and substr, but I was wondering if
there were a simpler way.  Perhaps I should hack the tf source to add a
new function?  What do people think?

There's already an example in "/help return":

/def strreverse = \
    /return strcat(strlen({*})>1 ? strreverse(substr({*},1)) : "", \
    substr({*},0,1)) 

Note that the result is returned, not echoed, so the macro should be used
as a function, not a command:

  /expr strreverse("very simple string")
  gnirts elpmis yrev

I have a variable which I -only- want to be included in the status
bar if the world type is of a specific type.

Basically, in pseudocode:


if ${world_type} == "irc" then
   put in the status bar, after the 'active' variable, the
   value of channel_${world_name}
else
   put nothing there.


I'm going nuts, but I can't figure it out :(

Hmmmm, i am wondering why i get 
	% return: no such command or macro
So i think this is a command that only exists in TF Version 4.x 
Is there a way to implement that for TF 3.5 Beta 4 ?

Please do not answer 'install version 4' ... I am very happy with my version
and don't want to change yet :)

You can use replace "/return ..." with "/echo $[...]", but then you have
to call it with $(...) in a macro body instead of as a function in an
expression.

That was definitely not what I meant. The mud sends me ANSI codes for
colouring the output. This has nothing to do with the way I can specify
the colours on the mud. All I want is that a line I get from the mud, that
is coloured using ANSI colours, *stays* coloured when I've caught it using
a trigger.

Mad.

No, it's not possible to keep the original color when you echo.  When you
use %{*} or any other sub to get the trigger line, you'll get only the text,
not the color.  The color always remains in the original line, but there is
no way to grab the text with its color for your own use.

That's not going to work if you have more than one world open though,
is it?

Yes, it works; TF loads the commands from the file specified for each world
whenever that world gets /fg'ed.

Hi guys and girls!

Is there any way to change the notify message? I'd like to have the
message to tell me who the e-mail is from and the subject of the message
so that I can decide whether I need to read it at once or not. Rigth now I
only get "You have new mail in...".

This works if you have sockmload=on.  But probably a better way to do it
is to use a WORLD hook for each world to redefine status_fields.

Thats my way to solve that problem:

/def -ag -hMAIL auto-mailer = /sys egrep "^From |^Subject" $MAIL

For me, it works perfectly :)

Hi,

I had the same wish and did it like that:

/def -P0g -mregexp -F -t'^<([0-9]+)Hp ([0-9]+)Ma ([0-9]+)Mv>' t_prompt = \
    /set hp=%{P1} %;\
    /set mana=%{P2} %;\
    /set mv=%{P3}

/set status_fields @world:12 hp:6:B :2 mana:4:B :2 mv:5:B :1 @more:8:Br \
  :1 @clock:5 
/set status_var_hp pad(hp,-4,"hp",2)
/set status_var_mana pad(mana,-3,"m",1)
/set status_var_mv pad(mv,-3,"mv",2)

(I shortened this a bit, my status line is longer ...)

I have to admit though that my prompt is no true prompt, I told the MUD 
to send a newline at it's end. Still I hope this version of the 
prompt trigger works as it should, which means gags the prompt but does 
not gag what's coming behind it.

Yes of course... the unix variable $MAIL stands for your mail directory.
If you do a 'echo $MAIL' on the command line of your unix shell, you'll
get something like '/var/spool/mail/jblosser'
The command /sys executes all the following on the shell. So you can
type on TF command line:
  /sys egrep "^From |^Subject" $MAIL

and will get (for example):

!From blah@fasel.org Mon Dec  8 11 11:58:04 97
!Subject: Re: your spam from fasel.org
  
To cause that line only to print the last received mail, you can improve
the trigger:

   /sys egrep "^From |^Subject" $MAIL | tail -2

I realize this; however, in TF '$' refers to macro execution, and '%'
to variables.  I tried it with $MAIL, and when new mail came, I just got
'no such macro MAIL' or something like that.  I changed it to %MAIL and
it worked fine.

If I type on the TF command line 
    /sys egrep "^From |^Subject" $MAIL | tail -2

I have got the following output:

!From jblosser@nostrum.com  Mon Dec  8 12:48:21 1997
!Subject: Re: notify

% TinyFugue version 3.5 beta 4 TK2.

So I am sorry about that, but i didn't know the differences between version 3

[snipped all the rest, sorry Altpeter Frank!]

No, of course NOT! There are (at least) two correct versions of the
proposed Mail-Hook:

/def -ag -hMAIL auto-mailer = /sys egrep "^From |^Subject" %MAIL
; %MAIL == tf var containing the absolute path to the users mail

Hello

My question is simple:

Has anyone managed to make tinyfugue (TinyFugue version 4.0 alpha 3)
work with iso-characters?

I've compiled tf on both my HPUX machine at work and on my Linux
machine at home and it works great except that it does not display the
swedish iso-charcters. (aring, odiaeresis, adiaeresis)

While I'm working in xterm it works great the 8bit characters
are being displayed.

I tried setting the LANG variable to sv_SE.iso88591, and C.iso88591
and I've tried setting:
/set istrip=off
/set meta_esc=off

But it still won't display any iso characters.

Any clues???

Thanks in advance

Michael

Here's another option that only lists new mail, and only uses 1 line for each
one:

/def -p1 -h'MAIL' = /sys mail -H | egrep "N( )+[0-9]+"

This assumes that your OS has a mail command that supports -H for header only.

stripped down to the essentials:

/addworld world.a.com 2000 ~/lib/tf/worlda.tf
/addworld world.b.com 4444 ~/lib/tf/worldb.tf

/sockmload on

then, in worlda.tf:
/set status_fields=<yada>

and in worldb.tf
/set status_fields=<yada>

This way, you can have both worlds open, and if you switch between the
worlds, each time you switch the status line will change to be correct.

Ok, I am ignorant... I have lots of macros, etc, that I only want active
in certain worlds.  Right now, I have /sockmload on, and have each world
load its own file.  Are you saying it would be better in general to define
a lot of WORLD hooks to set up the macros, vars, etc?  Or is this just
true with the status_fields for some reason?  And whichever it is, why
is this true?

I use this, which takes advantage of a mail program to do the subject/
sender retrieval:

/def -F -ahb -hMAIL hook_mail=\
  /if (idle() < 600) /repeat -0 1 /quote -S -decho !nfrm %; /endif

This will tell me all my 'unread' mail, but only if I'm awake. (I don't like
waking up to multiple lines of incoming mail, if I got several overnight.)

If you don't have nfrm, it's the same as 'frm -s new'.

You may also want to look at the 'from' command.

Hey there.  I'm extremely interested in porting tinyfugue to a win95
platform, but have run into a couple of problems.  I've downloaded the
cdk.exe file as directed on the tinyfugue homepage, but haven't been
able to get it to run at all.  If anyone has any advice, I'd greatly
appreciate it.  The version I'm currently trying to compile is tf 3.5
b4.  Thanks.

Strangely, I entered this:
/def -F -aBCgreen -mregexp -t'^([^A]|A[^ ]).+is here[.,]' player_hilite1

which is identical to what's above, with one space deleted, then, seeing that
I'd done so, I re-entered:
/def -F -aBCgreen -mregexp -t'^([^A]|A[^ ]).+ is here[.,]' player_hilite1

Neither highlighted the phrase:

A Citizen's Board is here.

I would suggest looking through your defs/highlights to see what's actually
highlighting this; it seems improbable that your regexps are hosed.

Any idea when/if a jumpy status line fix is going to be implemented for

Perhaps I should have been more specific, the phrase can have leading
spaces, so the actual def I tried was:

/def -F -aBCgreen -mregexp -t'([^A]|A[^ ]).+ is here[.,]' player_hilite1

I added an echo to it as a response, and checked to see if there were any
other highlights triggering it, I didn't find anything.

I also tried: 

/def -F -aBCgreen -mregexp -t'[ ]*([^A]|A[^ ]).+ is here[.,]'

but that didn't work either.

The output of version is:

% TinyFugue version 4.0 alpha 3.
% Copyright (C) 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 Ken Keys (hawkeye@tcp.com).

Still confused.

That trigger will match nearly every Line with 'xyz is here[,.]' in it,
because the trigger is not anchored.

The Line 'A Citizen's Boars is here.' will be matched although it
begins with 'A', because a part of the line ('Citizen's Board is here.')
perfectly matches your regexp.

Of course the result of this trigger is the same as above, because this
trigger isn't anchored either. 

Try to put a '^' at the beginning of your trigger.

Thanks for setting me straight, I'm still new to this stuff... Now one
minor problem left, if I have a trigger such as this:

/def -F -aBCgreen -mregexp -t'^  ([^A]|A[^ ]).+is here[.,]'

It will work for a line with 2 leading spaces, but I don't want to make a
trigger for every possible number of leading spaces cause that is ugly, if
I change it to this:

/def -F -aBCgreen -mregexp -t'^[ ]*([^A]|A[^ ]).+is here[.,]'

It stops working again...

Thanks
Raf

I can't imagine why. The second trigger works fine here.

Btw: the brackets in '[ ]*' are not necessary, ' *' works, too.

I'd never heard of sockmload, so that's what I've been -trying- to do,

Could you point out what's wrong?

How can I get send to send something to the socket without
treating things like ^Z like eof I am not even sure if it
sending and control characters at all. Its important I must
be able to send control charcters like ansi codes or backspaces.

don't use :0:, use :: instead. (I think) :0: never lets anything be
displayed, which was what happened when I tested it just now.

or try this:
/set status_var_irc_channel=${world_type}=~"irc"?%{channel_${world_name}}:""
then you don't need world hooks or anything.

Hello,

I am trying to compile TinyFugue 4.0a3 on  HP/UX 9.10 with cc.  I have had
no trouble with previous installations of 3.5 and earlier, but I
encountered the following error during the compilation of 4.0a3:

	cd ./src; { make install 2>&1; echo; cat exitmsg; } | \
	    { tee -a ../Build.log || cat; }
	cc -O  -c keyboard.c
"keyboard.c", line 123: syntax error:
	int handle_keyboard_input(int read_flag)
	                            ^
"keyboard.c", line 133: 'read_flag' undefined
*** Error code 1

I've gone through the unix/Config file several times, and I'm not sure if
I'm forgetting to include a compiler flag or something along those lines. 
Any assistance in how I can correct this problem would be greatly
appreciated. Thanks!

-Chris

How come tinyfugue doesn't work with this kind of prompt
like it says in help prompts it you put in your prompt
*\b which is an asteric followed by a backspace so this
would be *\8, then it says and GOHEAD telnet code. which is
\377\371, so I make a simple macro to set my prompt looks like
this
/def x = /send prompt >*\b\377\371

I need ">" so I have something visible to show as a prompt then
I send the codes, but this doesn't work at all. I have the LP=off
set. According to the help files this should work.

What am I doing wrong, I want to be able to do this so that
tinyfugue stops mistaking a half lagged line as a prompt.
this is the most annoying thing about TF for me.

it only works if the SERVER does that. Plus, many servers don't allow you
to send non-printable characters. Try just /prompt whatever.

why not just set prompt_sec and prompt_usec to higher numbers?

I want to send an evaluated variable to my mush. The name of the variable
is also partially constructed from a variable name.  I can set the variables
fine, but I can't seem to be able to fully evaluate the whole thing before
sending it to the game. 

This is an example (line numbers added for discussion purposes):

1: /def p = /if (%1 =/ "*=*") \
2:             /split %* %; \
3:             /set PAGEPERSON_%{fg_world}=%{P1} %; \
4:             p %PAGEPERSON_%{fg_world}=%{P2} %; \
5:          /else \
6:             p %PAGEPERSON_%{fg_world}=%* %; \
7:          /endif


I know that 'PAGEPERSON_xxxx' is being set just fine. I can see it with a 
manual '/set PAGEPERSON_Suns' (Suns being one of my world names).

However, the above just doesn't work. That specific example gives me an
'I dont recognize that name.' error from the mush.

If I change lines 4 and 6 to use '%{PAGEPERSON_%{fg_world}}' instead, I get
an error from tf: 
   % p: unmatched %{ or bad substitution

I've tried all sorts of combinations.. and tried using /eval, I've tried
setting a tempvar to the value of 'PAGEPERSON_%{fg_world}' and then 
evaluating %{tempvar} .. but that doesn't work either.

Help? :)

Try this:

/def p=\
  /if ({1} =/ "*=*") \
; it's better to use {} in expressions than %{} variables
    /split %* %;\
    /set PAGEPERSON_%{fg_world}=%{P1} %;\
    /let message=%P2 %;\
  /else \
    /let message=%* %;\
  /endif %;\
  /eval p %%{PAGEPERSON_%{fg_world}}=%%{message} %;\
; Use two % to delay substitution of the variable value

Yeah, you wanted a double %% at the beginning, so TF knows what to evaluate
first.

must know how to properaly set this up ?

Setting prompt_sec prompt_usec never seem to work. Lag is always
a problem. Why does TF have to do fancy prompt crap anyways ?
It should be an option. If I set lp=off then the prompt appears
in messed up places. When I use regular telnet prompt is fine
of course regular telnet sucks.

Your default value for matching is regexp?  If so the problem is the
/unset, at least in 4.0a2.  You might want to just use `{irc_channel}',
since the status_foo variables are expressions.

Once you do a /unset of a variable that tf is supposed to be monitoring
it forgets about it.  Just /set irc_channel to the empty string instead.

TF does not interpret those '\' sequences as control characters; to TF,
the '\' means ignore the special meaning (if any) of the next character.
So when /x is called, the command that gets executed is:
  /send prompt >*b377371

TF expects either asterisk backspace _or_ IAC GOAHEAD, not both.

If the mud is implemented correctly, and you set your prompt to include
IAC GOAHEAD, the mud will actually send IAC IAC GOAHEAD, which is not what
you want.

If your mud interprets '\b' as backspace, the command you want is:
  /send prompt >*\b
and a macro that will generate that command is:
  /def x = /send prompt >*\\b

If your mud does not interpret '\b' as backspace, but does accept control
characters, your command will have to send the actual control character.
One way to do that is by executing this version of /x:
  /def x = /send prompt >*$[char(8)]

Once you convince your mud to send asterisk backslash at the end of each
prompt, you can /set lp=off in tf.

Ok thanks, one thing though the \27 does get changed into a esc
sequence. You said these dont get translated.
for exmaple /def x = /send prompt \377\27
will not send \377\27 but the ascii values I have tested this my self.

Thanks again for the help.

Oops, forgot about that.  But for \nnn, nnn is interpreted as a decimal
number; you need \0nnn for octal.  377 and 371 are the octal values of
IAC GOAHEAD, so you would need to use \255\249 or \0377\0371.  But,
IAC GOAHEAD still probably won't work.  Asterisk-backspace should work,
and can be set with either of these macros:

      /def x = /send prompt >*$[char(8)]
      /def x = /send prompt >*/8

This is a very annoying thing about tinyfugue for WINNT
The mud lags or the link lags for around 15 seconds and
tinyfugue disconnects me. And most of the time I am left
with an active copy. This is very dangerous when mudding
and killing monsters or what not. Now when I used to use
tinyfugue on my shell account thru my provider it would
never drop my connection to the mud over 15 second lag
bursts. so how can I fix this ?

the LP mud I use the mud seems to translate backspace, and strip
anything over the 127th character. And I doubt the mud admins
are going to make big changes for something like this. But if
your program recognized something like <esc>1 or some code that
wouldn't be used by anything. Or just make the next version have
the prompt thing as an option. thanks.

I am using a one of the binary distributions for win32.

seems I got this command to partialy work. It messed up tinyfugue
some how though. I downloaded usertools, extracted the sh.exe
file, copied it to my tinyfugue bin directory. started tf
typed something like /sh ls, worked fine but tinyfugye started
acting strange. heres what it looked like.


/sh ls
% Executing command: ls
% Resuming TinyFugue.
    C:\PROGRAM FILES\TF\BIN\*.*
MOUNT.EXE    test.txt     tf.exe       tfrc         tiny.exe
SH.EXE       tf-40a3.exe  tf3k         tfswords     tiny.log
    582009 (582009) bytes in 10 files

why does it say Resuming TinyFugue before the command is done ?
I really mess tinyfigue up bad if I exceute the following command
/sh cmd
cmd is the command shell under NT.

A while ago someone was asking about a mail hook. Here's mine:

/def -ag -h"MAIL" mail_update_hook=\
	/quote -dexec /set latest_mail=!frm-s new | head -1 %;\
	/quote -dexec /set total_unread=!frm -q -S%;\
	/eval /echo -p %%@{h}New Mail:@{n} %{latest_mail}%;/eval /echo %% 
%{total_unread}

It's not the most efficent construct in the world, but it works and 
gives what was asked for - who the new mail is from, the subject and 
adds a second line giving a mail summary.

First, I want to thank Mike Kaufman for helping me through some of the
compiler flags.  Most of the files look like they're compiling okay now
with HPUX cc, but I'm still unable to reach the finishing point of the
compilation and installation.  After compiling the different individual
files, the compiler halts at the following:

	cd ./src; { make install 2>&1; echo; cat exitmsg; } | \
	    { tee -a ../Build.log || cat; }

	make -f ../unix/unix.mak CC='cc' CFLAGS='-Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE -O -w ' makehelp
Make: line 67: syntax error.  Stop.
*** Error code 1

I've tried compiling on IRIX 6.2 and have encountered the exact error, so
I'm not sure if I'm just not configuring something correctly in the Config
file.  Any suggestions?  I'm anxious to get a look at 4.0a3's new
features. ;)

Some versions of make don't like variable targets.  So, change line 67
of unix/unix.mak from this:

  $(TF): tf$(X) $(BUILDERS)

to this:

  install_TF $(TF): tf$(X) $(BUILDERS)

This is already implemented for the next release.

Hello

My question is simple:

Has anyone managed to make tinyfugue (TinyFugue version 4.0 alpha 3)
work with iso-characters?

I've compiled tf on both my HPUX machine at work and on my Linux
machine at home and it works great except that it does not display the
swedish iso-charcters. (aring, odiaeresis, adiaeresis)

While I'm working in xterm it works great the 8bit characters
are being displayed.

I tried setting the LANG variable to sv_SE.iso88591, and C.iso88591
and I've tried setting:
/set istrip=off
/set meta_esc=off

But it still won't display any iso characters.

Any clues???

Thanks in advance

Michael

This seemed like a great idea to try, so I inputted it as written (not
really understanding all the code involved).  My system is this:

% TinyFugue version 4.0 alpha 3.
% Copyright (C) 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 Ken Keys (hawkeye@tcp.com).
% Built for Linux #7 Wed Dec 4 12:44:27 EST 1996 2.0.27

I'm getting nothing trying to run this.  It doesn't even come up with the
mail prompt in the status bar.  Can someone send out either a corrected
version, suggestions for how to get this to work, or even just tell me
that it should work and my system must be messed up?  Thanks.  :)
I did recondebse the last two lines into one as I suspected it was
originally before my mailer got ahold of it, both with and without a
space.

you don't need one. Try this instead:
= /echo -p %% %{h}New Mail:@{n} $(/quote -Sdecho !frm -s new | tail -1)%; \
/quote -Sdecho !frm -q -S

by the way, doesn't 'frm' come with elm? Just so people know in case they
don't have it.

I use egrep, but mine's usually wildly inaccurate if there's a From: line
in the mail, as I found out earlier this morning.

It seems so, as the manpage tells us the author is the Elm Development
Group.

Go and grab "^From ". That may help as a line beginning with "From " in the
body is escaped (like putting a > in front of it) as such a line means a new
message begins there. Or, if you want the "From: " line, seach for the
(first) "From: " line in the header. The header begins with "^From " and
ends with an empty line "^$". Awk is your friend, or use perl.

Beware Most of my files are dependant on each other and I
use regexp by default.  There is a lot of stuff here and
if you logon to lpmuds a lot you might want to take a look.
Most of what I have coded is for Zombiemud (zombiemud.org 3000)
and much of it depends on tf40a3

That'd work, but where do I find the auto-login code?

This is driving me nuts!

Objective:  IF the current world is of type "irc" then I want to have
the irc channel in the sttaus bar after the world.  Otherwise, that
spot should be blank.

This is what I have currently:

/set status_fields= \
  @more:8:Br \
  @world:10:Cblue \
  irc_channel::Cblue \
  @active:10:Cblue \
  @log:3:Cblue \
  insert:3:Cblue \
  @clock:5:Cblue  

/set status_int_more \
   moresize() == 0 ? "" : \
   moresize() > 9999 ? "Lots" : \
   pad("More", 4, moresize(), 4)
/set status_int_world   ${world_name}
/set status_var_irc_channel   %{irc_channel}
/set status_int_read    inread() ? "Read" : ""
/set status_int_active  nactive() ? pad("Active:",0,nactive(),2,"") : ""
/set status_int_log     nlog() ? "Log" : ""
/set status_int_mail    nmail() ? "Mail" : ""
/set status_var_insert  insert ? "" : "Ovr"
/set status_int_clock   ftime("%I:%M", time())

/def -h"WORLD (.*)" = \
   /if (${world_type} =~ 'irc')\
      /eval /set irc_channel %%{channel_${world_name}} %;\
   /else \
      /set irc_channel=''%;\
   /endif


It doesn't WORK.

For a start, "/set irc_channel=''" set is to literally '' so I get the
's in the status line, which is wrong.  (As a workaround I'm setting
it to _ instead, which is cute but shouldn't be necessary).

But secondly, it's just not -working-.  To see why, I changed the world-hook
to this:

/def -h"WORLD (.*)" = \
   /if (${world_type} =~ 'irc')\
      /eval /set irc_channel %%{channel_${world_name}} %;\
   /else \
      /set irc_channel=_%;\
   /endif%;\
   /echo *** IRC_CHANNEL is now '%{irc_channel}'

And the *** line only gets echoed for worlds that are NOT of type
"irc".  How come?


A very baffled,
Gossamer

I am trying to set something like this up.

/def -t"HP: 186" eat=eat meat%;

or since thats not right, what I am trying to do is to have a trigger
that if my HP drops below 186 eat a chunk of meat, I cant seem to get it
to work properly and if someone could give me a little help I would
appreciate it..

Thanks in advance.

You probably have another non-fallthru WORLD hook blocking this one.
Try running this with "/set mecho=all" to see exactly what happens.
Also, I recommend naming your WORLD hook macro.

With reference to the messages about reversing an input string and sending it
to a world, I have: 

/def strreverse = /return strcat(strlen({*})>1 ? strreverse(substr({*},1)) :
"", substr({*},0,1))

/def rev = $[strreverse(%*)]

...and this works for any string less than 42 characters. Why?  And how to make
it work for any string length?

I was the person who originally asked that question.  I followed the
directions, upgraded to 4.0b3, changed line 87 of expand.c to
#define STACKSIZE 1024
and put, in my .tfrc, the line
/set max_recur=300

This allowed me to reverse longer strings.

Good luck and happy holidays,
Eric

At a guess, you're hitting a recursion limit with the 42.  How to get
around it I do -not- know.

You know, I wonder if the list is eating my posts cause I'm not using a
valid From: address (I was using a valid reply-to address though)

I'll try to post this again.

I remember answering this before, but you can try something like
/set status_var_irc_channel = ${world_type}=~"irc" ? 
channel_${world_name} : ""

you don't need world hooks, I think.
Oh yeah, if you want to set something to an empty string, try something like:
/set irc_channel=%;

there's a recursion limit, I think. Maybe doing something like
/if (strlen({*})>40) /return
strcat(strreverse(substr({*},40)),strreverse(substr({*},0,39)))%;
/endif... at the
beginning.

before 4.0, I used to do something like that using the 'rev' command..
first defining a command shellescape like so

/def shellescape=/escape `"$$\\\\ %*
(I don't think I have all of them here... maybe ; also)

and then I added a /rev command that did

/def rev = /quote -Sdecho !echo "$(/shellescape %*)"|rev

so that might work for you too.

Doesn't work 'cause channel_${world_name} doesn't get evaluated,
and you can't put an /eval in an expression like that.

That version of strreverse is not very efficient; I made it simple to use
as an example for "/help return".  As anyone who has taken an algorithms
class can tell you, that algorithm has a recursion depth proportional to
N (where N is the length of the string), so it doesn't take a very large
string to overflow tf's internal stack.  The version below is much smarter:
it splits the string in half each time and recurses on that, so the recusion
depth is proportional to log2(N) (which I estimate will only overflow tf's
stack for strings more than about 4 trillion characters, and you'll run
out of other resources long before you create a string that large).

/def strreverse = \
    /let len=$[strlen({*})]%; \
    /return (len <= 1) ? {*} : \
        strcat(strreverse(substr({*},len/2)), strreverse(substr({*},0,len/2)))

With this version, I successfully reversed a string of length 27599 (which
took 20 seconds on a 166MHz Pentium).


By the way, the iterative version below took 93 seconds on the same long
string (and required increasing the value of %max_iter).

/def strreverse = \
    /let i=$[strlen({*})]%; \
    /let result=%; \
    /while (--i >= 0) \
        /test result:=strcat(result, substr({*},i,1))%; \
    /done%; \
    /return result

Many sites will throw out any messages with invalid envelope sender
address to prevent some forms of spam and mail bombing.  tcp.com is
such a site.  And since an illegal envelope was used bounces never
go back to the original sender.

Hi, I'm trying to help my friend install tf into this account and when
installation gets to the part where it starts.... 'parsing' I guess
command.c I get errors. I think the first one is 
'command.c:43: warning: useless keyword or type name in empty declaration'

I tried uncommenting  CC=cc and then uncommenting CCFLAGS=-g the third
pass through but got the same set of errors. Can anyone see what the
problem might be or would it require more information? (I have saved the
Build.logs but I didn't want to just dump them on here without asking,
first)

Thanks for any suggestions
Alice Pinard

Okay, all the errors you've been getting refer back to the same line:

	extern int restrict;

This line is the same in 3.5b4 and 4.0a2 (haven't checked a3 cuz I don't have
it handy).

It took me a while to figure out why this is a problem, but the answer's
really rather simple: the new C standard (C9X as it's being called now, or the
second ANSI revision of C) defines a keyword 'restrict' that recommends to the
compiler that taking an alias to a particular pointer should not be allowed,
or something of the sort. To my eyes, it's about as useful as the 'register'
and 'auto' keywords, but I have yet to see it used in experience.

I'm not sure how to solve this, exactly. The simplest method would probably be
to replace all occurances of 'restrict' with some variant ('re_strict' or
something equally inane could work). There may also be an option flag or a
preprocessor define that you could pass to the compiler to prevent using the
newer C9X stuff. Since you've told me this is a Linux 2.0.* box, I'm
relatively certain you're looking at gcc as the primary compiler, and that
further means that you've got a newer version of gcc than I do.

Granted, this is suspicion and I can't test my thesis without replacing my
compiler. Furthermore, the references I had to the C9X proposed standard
websites seem to have vanished from my email box and would require more
research to rediscover than I presently have time to offer.

Good luck!

Does anyone know where i can get hold of a precomplied copy of tf compiled
on win95. I normally use the unix version but my server is unreachable
atm.

Thanks

There are two that I am aware of.  Ryan Fitch has one with some patches 
applied, and I have one with some different patches applied.  Mine is

Short answer:  wait for tf 4.0 alpha 4.

Long answer:  I had already determined that "restrict" was reserved by _new_
gcc and/or linux headers, but my theory was that it was a bug in the
compiler; I didn't realize it was part of a new draft standard (which isn't
surprising, since the draft was just opened to voting earlier this month).
I have renamed "restrict" in 40a4 to comply with the new draft standard
(which, btw, is located at http://www.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/).

4.0 alpha 4 (12/28/97)
-----------
Added /exit to abort a /load.
Added %auto_fg, so automatic foreground after disconnect is optional.
Function forms of tr(), replace(), and grab() preserve spaces in arguments.
read() is obsolete.  Use tfread() instead.
Reconnecting to a world with a "dead" Socket will re-use that Socket.
Variables used in %status_fields can not be unset.
ESC-w in world-q.tf does something useful after disconnect and /bg.
Restored old undocumented behavior of | and & returning value of last operand.
Eliminated spurious pedantic warning for string in integer context, for
  special variables with value 0. (40a3)
Workaround for limitation in some versions (HP-UX) of "make".
Fixed "restrict" error under new gcc due to conflict with "C9X" draft.
Fixed handling of mod() by zero.
Fixed redraw bug for changing isize while visual=off (e.g., in .tfrc).
Fixed use of %? after error in /return or /test.
Fixed "/return variable" and "/test variable" returning an empty value.
Fixed %status_fields: right justification, strings containing ":". (40a3)
Fixed: interrupt during a tfread() from the keyboard disconnected sockets.
Fixed handling of world_info() with illegal field name. (40a1)
Fixed /list for macros with -Fp0.

	I am having some problems with TF 4.0 alpha *.  I have tried alphas 1,

like:

Then it continues with loading my script files and tons more errors.

Im running Linux 2.0.30 (Redhat 4.2) on an x86 processor.  On the last install
I deleted all traces of previous install so I do not beleive it is crossed
versions...  Any ideas?  This is quite annoying as I would really like to use
new features of TF 4.0.

Sometimes on lines that display more than one color of ansi make
that whole line that one color. Best way to describe it it
bleeding. I seen this happen on TF for over a year.
But is there anyway this could be fixed ?

I am using the tinfyfuige for winnt from the tinyfugue site.

I use emulation=ansi_attr, i need to use the emulation so word wrap
works correctly. There are still a few bugs for the NT version
though, hopefully this will be fixed soon.

The latest one from the tinyfugue website.
Seems I cant cant load library files from tf-lib
I have the following set, also you can put '\' as part
of the filename. Once TF starts up it thinks its runing on
unix and all file names uses '/' but that wasn't what was causing
the problems.
TFLIBDIR=C:/Program Files/TinyFugue 4.0a4/tf-lib

Tinyfugue sets the correct variable but then I get the following
messages when starting up


C:\Program Files\TinyFugue 4.0a4>tf xxx

see where is says load: warning, well thats the exact path to map.tf
and its not finding it. I know all these files are here.

Now I am running this under NT 4.0, now if this works fine
on win 95/98 but not on NT then we need to have seperate versions
then.

Is there any place I can ftp a precompiled os/2 copy of TF 40a4? I tried
compiling and make failed in socket.c (would having emx 09c instead of a

Hello,

I have a question regarding the /dopath which is defined in %{TFLIBDIR}/map.tf.

Some paths include commands like "enter" or something, which is no problem for
the macro. But when it gets to the point where a "enter ship" is needed the
macro can't handle it because of it's space seperated list of directions.

Any ideas about solving this problem without having 3 or more /def's for just 1
path?

IMHO the most beautiful method would be something like

/dopath 3 n w "enter ship" d 3 "pull string" u ashore

This way even "spaced commands" could be repeated. :-)

Thanks for your answer in advance.

Harry

Hello to all!

        I had just subscribed to this mail list, did not get any
message on it yet, so do not know who will receive my mail. Anyway, I
am asking for a help.

        I was using TF 3.5 and now use 4.0a3. Both caused problems
with connecting through firewall. I have a Gauntlet proxy, so first I
have done as it is written in /help proxy, wrote these lines in .tfrc
file:

/set proxy_host labproxy
/set proxy_port 23

After that TF connected to the mud, but the problem is that when it
gets an answer from the mud with the prompt for a name, it sends a
newline character to the output stream. I don't know why it
happens. The reaction of the mud to the newline character is that it
just closes the connection. I tried the following (read it in /help
proxy too):

  /def proxy_command =\
      /def -p10000 -w -1 -h'PROMPT tn-gw->*' =\
          telnet $${world_host} $${world_port}%%; \
          /localecho on%%; \
          /def -p10002 -w -1 -h'PROMPT tn-gw->*' proxy_error_$${world_name} =\
              /undef proxy_success_$$${world_name}%%%;\
              /dc%%;\
          /def -p10002 -w -1 -t'Connected to *' proxy_success_$${world_name} =\
              /undef proxy_error_$$${world_name}%%%;\
              /trigger -hCONNECT $$${world_name}%%%;\
              /if ($$${world_character} !~ "") \
                  /trigger -hLOGIN ${world_name}%%%;\
              /endif

but it does not work either, I mean TF connects, but sends a newline
character too.

I tried to run `tf labproxy 23' and after that typed op <host> <port>
to the tn-gw-> prompt. The same result again :

I don't know why it happens again and again. I trued to debug TF and
find the macro that makes it send the newline, but it appeared to me
too difficult. I don't understand what happens. The only idea I have
is that our gateway needs not "\n\r" newline sequence, but just
"\n". Maybe I am wrong...

I have found an old 3.5a7 version that does not know anything about
proxyes and it works ok. But I do not like to use it, it is really too
old.

I am asking for a help. Doesn't anyone use TF through a proxy ?  Maybe
I have done something wrong ?

In general, if it is a Win32 specific bug, you can mail me and I'll 
see if I know a workaround, if not, we can post to Ken.  

As of now, I know of four specific Win32 bugs.

Jumpy visual, which will not be fixed until Cygnus releases b19, 
which supposedly resolves some of the termcap issues.  

The next big issue the /sh command, I am adapting it to better 
exploit the NT console in either bash or cmd mode.

The two remaining bugs, /quote and /sys are less likely to be 
resolved in the near term, unless Ken has some ideas.  I personally
get the feeling that he would rather not make an notable codebase 
changes to support Win32, so I'm trying to alleviate the headaches 
on him by fielding some of these issues, and  helping to support 
the Win32 users out there.

- Misc. Notes -

If you compile TF using HARDCODE ansi you will see better results 
on the jump and wordwrap issues.

	Well tf-40a4 compiled wonderfully (Thank you, Geoff and TFGod)
but it looks like we're not quite out of the woods yet. When I do /world
<textaddress> <port> I get host name lookup errors and when I do /world
<ip address> <port> I get 'socket: Out of streams resources' 
	I knew someone else who had this same problem at another site but
after talking to their site admin, and on discovering that there was an
extra fee for telnet access from the account, and paying it, tf worked
fine. This account, however, has no such restrictions and I can telnet to
<textaddress> <port> quite easily. Is there anything in tf itself that
might cause this error?

Hi,

I wonder if it's possible to use tinyfugue to do a double telnet connection.
I'm thinking of connecting to my account on the mud computer and then 
from there to connect to the mud, but running the client locally, not on 
the mud computer. Reason is easy: my site here is banned (that's what I 
received the account on the mud computer for), but I don't want to 
install tinyfugue there. Why "waste" disk space if I can use my already 
installed version here?

So, does anyone know if such a double connect is possible with tf?

Susan Dittmar

PS: Happy New Year :-)

Yes, I have to do it to use the proxy server I use, I actually set my world
up to the proxy/telnet server then automate the actual connection to the MUD
via /defined triggers that get purged upon a successfull connection.

There is.  Type '/help proxy/ for info... use the remote machine as the
proxy server.

Enjoy!

I had the same problem. Your method would be cool, but i have solved it 
withe the muds alias system.
If you define an alias 'ship_enter' and 'string_pull' you can
    /dopath 3 n w ship_enter d 3 string_pull u ashore 
    and so on :-)))
It is not the perfection itself, but it works fine :)

You have to use Cygwin paths, not DOS paths, for any path that is read by
tf.  So, you can use this:
  TFLIBDIR=//C/Program Files/TinyFugue 4.0a4/tf-lib
or, assuming your dos C: is mapped to cygwin /, you can use this:
  TFLIBDIR=/Program Files/TinyFugue 4.0a4/tf-lib

 Ken said something a long time ago about changing the way attributes
were used, from using -PB1Cgreen in the beginning to use something like
@{BCgreen}<text>@{n} for more efficient highlites.

 Now I haven't heard of this since, and I thought it was a coming
feature.. Until I recently looked through the stdlib.tf file and
discovered it's already in use.

 Now can someone tell me where to find the help on the subject, as I
haven't been able to locate it..

Maybe this is a trivial request (actually, I'm pretty sure it is, but I'm
going to mention it anyway), but I'd really like to see the standard library's
spell.tf allow options to 'spell' (and maybe even an optional speller?). It's
(difficult|impossible) to use ispell without such options, and 'spell' on my
system appears to be braindead to the point that it's almost not worth using,
and while it's certainly /feasible/ for me to not /require spell.tf and then
simply shove a hacked version into my macro file, it seems contrary to the
whole purpose of a standard library.

Thanks for the consideration. :)

Well, having written this macro, I'm in a good position to tell you
what it looks for. :)

On 'tiny'-type worlds, mesages from the system which are not part of
normal dialog or description frequently begin with '>>' or '##'.

This macro turns lines starting with either of those character pairs
which come from 'tiny' worlds red.

I included that cut-down file as an example, so folks would know where
to put it, and to get folks started.

I need to document these things better, huh?

Hi everyone. On a mud I'm playing, alias space is limited. What I'm trying
to do is make a set of "socials" that would be local to my client.
I have the basic format done.

For example, I type "jump" and it sends "emote jumps around like a fool."
Now, this works quite well, and I want to take the next step, and make
them a little more interactive. I want the following behaviour:

Type "jump", it sends "emote jumps around like a fool."
Type "jump someperson", it sends "emote jumps circles around someperson,
who looks astounded."

Now, for the plain social, I have the following macros defined:
/def -wwolf makesocial = /def -wwolf -mglob -p1 -h'SEND {%1}' = %-1
/makesocial laugh emote laughs like an insane person.

Now, for the interactive ones, I have this:
/def -wwolf -p1 -h'SEND {laugh}*' = /if (strlen(%2)=0) emote laughs.%; \
  /else emote laughs at %2's antics.%; /endif

Now, this *works*, but I was hoping to put in a macro similar to
makesocial that would simplify creating any more of these complex socials.
I have tried a great many different ways, but none of them work, so I
won't add to an already long message by including them.

Can anyone show me a possible solution? I would appreciate any help you
could offer. If replies are sent to me, I will summarize and post any
working solution(s) to the list.

Thank you all in advance,
Chris Hilts

you know that a glob could do the same thing, right?
I think you can do "{>>|##}*" and get the same thing to increase
performance slightly.
If you want to stick with the regexp, maybe put the ^ outside the
parentheses (I'm not sure if that'll help though)

ok, so this isn't right after all since you wanted to do stuff to other
people.
You can try this...
/def jump = /if ({2}) emote jumps at %2%; /else emote jumps%; /endif
but then you'd have to use /jump, but it would be easier than defining a
bunch of send hooks that would have to parse your input all over again.
or you can just /def -h'send jump*' jump = ...
and get the same thing.

Hello,

I tried to use the /log command to log what I'm doing and what happens when I
explore areas. I have a big problem with the -i option which should log my
keyboard input.
Only a few commands get logged - it seems like entering a command more than once
in a row it does not get logged. :-( The /watchdog is disabled.

What's the problem with that loggin?

Harry

/def -T"tiny" -mregexp -aCred -t"^(>>|##)" TINY_sh1

is how I'd write it.

Whether it's a performance issue I have no idea, I've got pages and
pages and -pages- of highlights, some of them hideously complicated,
and never noticed any performance hit at all.

[... long description of how to do simple aliases without aliases ...]

How about this insetad?

/require alias.tf

;Short for social "satisf". If given any arguments, probably typo for "say"
/alias sat /if /test "%*" =~ "" %;/then satisf%;/else say %*%;/endif

;Build new social with emote. "grin" or "grin <someone>".
/alias grin /if /test "%*" =~ "" %;/then emote grins broadly %;/else emote grins broadly at \%%* %;/endif


Those two works just fine, and creates just the effect you are looking for.
Without being too complex. ;-)

Not the best subject... anyway...

The server sends:
[ Name, sex, species, nickname, looked at you ]

nickname only appears if it's different than the name (i.e. only if set)

What I'm trying to is make it so brackets are green, for example, and the
stuff inside is magenta or another color other than green... really be
nice for anything in [ ] to show up like that - some stuff is only a few
words long w/o commas.

What I tried, that obviously didn't work:
/def -p2 -ag -mglob -t'\[*\]' hltimportant = /eval /echo -aCmagenta [ %;
/echo -aCgreen %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %; /echo -aCmagenta ]

It's all on one line in the tiny.hilite file. %2 - %8 was the only way I
saw to get it to read the stuff in the middle.

what tf does with the server output:

[
Name, sex, species, nickname, looked at you
]

It does get the colors right, though. :o>


Someone tell me if what I'm trying to do is possible? Tankoo..
