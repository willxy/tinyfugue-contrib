Well, I don't have anything in python, but I recently got the java
portion of an automapper for tf into a beta state.  I'm trying to get
the two programs to interface nicely.  When it's done, it should be
pretty slick.

Current features:
 - easy to medium learning curve (nothing a tinyfuguer can't handle)
 - maintains a (homegrown) db of rooms (descriptions, exits (obvious and
   non), and notes).  Rooms are held in a memory sensitive cache to
   reduce disk loads.
 - maintains a set of regions, which cache path lengths between entrance
   and exit rooms, and limit the number of rooms loaded while finding a
   path
 - handles special exits that require multiple commands to navigate,
   select a destination, have an arrival delay, or go to random
   destinations (the random destination part is not great yet)
   - This is where most of the learning curve exists...
 - maintains a set of named rooms (center of town, myHouse, entrance to
   Hell, etc) 

The idea is to get this working with tf, so you can type '/go myHouse',
and have it generate a path from wherever you are to your house.

What I'm struggling with:

 - I'd like to get tf to monitor System.out and System.err, print the
   err stream to the display, and perform actions based on System.out
 - The backup System.out plan is to prefix every line to System.out with
   something like 'automapper.out' and send it to tfout, and set up gag
   triggers, but I'd rather have something more elegant.
 - The backup System.err plan is 
   /quote -decho ERROR !"tail -f <system.err.filename>"
   but again, I'd rather something more elegant.  Also, that is a very
   platform dependant.

The main trouble I'm having is that once a file stream in tf reaches an
EOF, it seems to go to a state where you can never read from it again,
regardless of whether more is written.

Is there a way to get tfread to block until something is available, so I
can use:
/while (true)\
  /test tfread( system.out.stream.handle, cmdStr ) %;\
  /buildcommand cmdStr %;\
  /if( commandReady )\
    /doCommand %;\
  /endif %;\
/done

Sorry this ended up so long.  I'm not that great at shell/script
programming (LOTs of trial and error), so I might need quite a bit of
help at this point.

If anyone is interested, I can send them the .java source as a 52K .jar
file.

Thanks,

This is something I know should be easy, but I can't figure out how to 
do it.  I'm testing a trig like this (which highlights the word 'arrives'):

/def -PCcyan -mregexp -t' arrives ' arrilite

What's a good way to test this locally?  running /trigger on expected 
text doesn't do anything because there is no macro body to execute, it 
just lights incoming text.

What I'd like is some way to /echo the text, but have it be affected by 
all trigs as if it came from the mud, so that highlights like this will 
show up.  I didn't find anything looking through the docs for /trigger 
and /echo, and fooling around wasn't productive.

Is there any way to do this?

Thanks
Jason

I've always used 

/def -F -PhCcyan -mregexp -t' arrives ' arrlite

One way to test it is to use the /trigger command.
/trigger -(l or n either one) ploddy arrives unexpectedly

If it works you will see one of two possible outcomes.
If you use the n option, you will get a response that the text would have matched one trigger
If you use the l option, you will see the trigger that would have matched.

There could be a possible conflict if there is ever punctuation at the end of arrives.
I haven't checked this out but this could alleviate that issue as well.

/def -F -PhCcyan -mregexp -t' arrives[^a-zA-Z0-9]' arrlite

This way, it will only match the string ' arrives' and anything other than caps or small letters and numbers.
So it should match ' arrives.' or ' arrives,'  or ' arrives!'

Gives you some flexibility.

I'm aware of "/trigger -n" and "/trigger -l", but as I said originally, 
they just tell me that a trigger would've matched, it doesn't actually 
DO the matching (and just "/trigger" doesn't help either because there's 
no macro body).

Just knowing that it would match is ok for something like arrlite, but 
when working on something a little more complicated, like:

/def -F -P1BCmagenta -E'liteWho' -mregexp -t' (\([^\)]+\))$' nicknameLite

I'd like to be able to see no just whether it matched, but WHAT it would 
highlight (as I'm often grossly wrong).  Some of the things I'm 
highlighting only happen in rare circumstances (like my own death) and I 
don't want to have to actually reproduce it in-game in order to test the 
trigs.

Is there really no form of "/echo -matchTrigs Some test text"?

Hi Jason,
My trig testing method:
1) Copy text from log into a textfile
2) Fire up TF and connect to my unix shell (127.0.0.1)
3) "more" that textfile
4) If anything in the trigs is supposed to send text to the MUD, then type =
"h"

Hope this helps,
Mike

Heya, new to the list, and new to tf.. but lovin' it thus far.

I am trying to build a script to make a random move after a random
time, to wander a city...

For example:
go north in 3 secs
go se in 11 secs
go west in 7 secs
...

Here's my little ran_move function so far:

/def ran_move = /let randnum=$[rand(1,8)] %; \
                /let randtime=$[rand(3,11)] %; \
                /if (%{randnum} == 1) north %; /echo north %; \
                /elseif (%{randnum} == 2) south %; /echo south %; \
                /elseif (%{randnum} == 3) east %; /echo east %; \
                /elseif (%{randnum} == 4) south %; /echo south %; \
                /elseif (%{randnum} == 5) northwest %; /echo northwest %; \
                /elseif (%{randnum} == 6) northeast %; /echo northeast %; \
                /elseif (%{randnum} == 7) southwest %; /echo southwest %; \
                /elseif (%{randnum} == 8) southeast %; /echo southeast %; \
                /endif %;

This works to move me, but I want to add a 3-11 second delay before
the move, so ideally, I would like the movement lines to look more
like this:

/elseif (%{randnum} == 2) /repeat -randtime 1 south %; /echo south %; \

So, I assume you see the problem, how can I execute these random moves
at random times?  A variable is not a valid parameter for the /repeat
function.

Also, how could I create a loop to wander around randomly, but allow
me to turn it ON and OFF, in game...  make sense?

Hope I challenged some of ya!  Glad to have found this list, look
forwward to contributing as much as possible!

Thanks,
-stirman

I am using OS X, and can't seem to scroll back at all. visual mode is
on... and I have a key hard bound to /dokey pageback

% dokey: No editing function pageback  ???

You can use /eval, like this:

/elseif ({randnum} == 2) /eval /repeat -%{randtime} 1 south %; /echo south %; \

/def ran_move = /let randnum=$[rand(1,8)] %; \
                /let randtime=$[rand(3,11)] %; \
                /if ({randnum} == 1) /eval /repeat -%{randtime} 1 north %; /echo north %; \
                /elseif ({randnum} == 2) /eval /repeat -%{randtime} 1 south %; /echo south %; \
                /elseif ({randnum} == 3) /eval /repeat -%{randtime} 1 east %; /echo east %; \
                /elseif ({randnum} == 4) /eval /repeat -%{randtime} 1 south %; /echo south %; \
                /elseif ({randnum} == 5) /eval /repeat -%{randtime} 1 northwest %; /echo northwest %; \
                /elseif ({randnum} == 6) /eval /repeat -%{randtime} 1 northeast %; /echo northeast %; \
                /elseif ({randnum} == 7) /eval /repeat -%{randtime} 1 southwest %; /echo southwest %; \
                /elseif ({randnum} == 8) /eval /repeat -%{randtime} 1 southeast %; /echo southeast %; \
                /endif %; \
                /if ({random_walking_on}) \
                    /eval /repeat -%{randtime} 1 /ran_move %; \
                /endif

/def turn_on_random_walking = \
    /set random_walking_on=1 %; \
    /ran_move

/def turn_off_random_walking = \
    /unset random_walking_on


With this code, you will actually go two more directions after you use
the /turn_off_random_walking command. You can correct this fairly easily
with a few more /if statements.

Put /visual off in your tfrc file, fixes the problem. You lose the
nice command bit at the bottom, but you'll be able to scroll. The only
other way is using the /recall command, and that's not too pretty.

Exactly what I was looking for... many thanks!

Now, on to the 2nd half of the script: only walking in valid
directions!   This is the exits text from a random room in the game I
play:

You see exits leading north, northeast (open door), east, southeast (open
door), south (open door), southwest, west, northwest, and in (open door).

I would love to modify this script to only walk in directions that are
valid.  Now, I am VERY new when it comes to pattern matching and
related code, and I'm not sure if it's possible to store valid
directions in an array or something, and pick a direction from there,
maybe instead of using the random number method I am using now?

Well, I really appreciate the help!  I'm spending more time scripting
than I am actually playing the game!  I am really enjoying tf.  Was
using ZMud on a PC, got a mac, switched to tf... I like ZMud but the
flexibility without the gui hassles of tf is beautiful... thanks
again!

Oh, I should have added, I could care less about the doors, ins, outs,
ups and downs...

But if it's more trouble to strip 'em out, I wouldn't mind walking
into closed doors every once in a while!

Thanks!

I just upgraded to tf 5.0 beta 7, and I've found that I can no longer use 
the numpad for entering numbers. I mainly do creation, not playing, on 
muds, so I am constantly entering numbers. I used the numpad for doing 
this. I've tried:

/def key_nkp1 = 1
/def key_nkp2 = 2
/def key_nkp3 = 3
/def key_nkp4 = 4
/def key_nkp5 = 5
/def key_nkp6 = 6
/def key_nkp7 = 7
/def key_nkp8 = 8
/def key_nkp9 = 9
/def key_nkp0 = 0
/def key_nkp. = .
/def key_nkpEnt = ^M

but when I hit '1' on the numpad, it sends through '1' and enter. Is there 
any way to def a key binding to NOT send the keystroke through to the mud 
immediately?

Thanks.

This should work without redefining the keys - at least still seems to
work 'as before' on my machine.

Yes, use /input to put text in the input buffer:
/def key_nkp1 =3D /input 1

I am trying to build a small script that will detect valid exits in
the room I am standing in, so if I must run, I can do that without
having to re-look for the exits.  The game I play, has exit lines as
such:

You see exits leading north, northeast (open door), east, southeast
(open door), south (open door), southwest, west, northwest, and in
(open door).

The only exits I care about are north, south, east, west, northwest,
northeast, southwest and southeast.  So, I am trying to do something
like this (but it ain't workin'!):

/def -t"*north," set_north = /set north=true %;     <--- comma after dir
/def -t"*north " set_north = /set north=true %;     <--- space after dir
/def -t"*north." set_north = /set north=true %;     <--- period after dir

..for each direction I care about.

This pattern matching isn't working, and furthermore, when I have got
something similar to work, it will only detect ONE direction on each
line.

Basically, I would like a set of triggers that after I see the "You
see exits leading " line, sets all the directions to either true or
false depending on if there's a valid exit in that direction, make
sense?

Thanks!
-Jason

You cannot have more than one macro with the same name. The second
definition will replace the first. So either choose distinct names (like
set_north1, set_north2, ..) or combine the triggers into one macro:
/def -t"*north[,. ]" set_north = /set north=true %;

Where [,. ] matches either comma, period or space.

Ciao,
Johan

I'm trying to use Galvin's array code to store @teleport points for TinyMUSH games.
  
  To teleport around the games, you type "@tel me=<number>". 
  
  To store locations in the array, I have done the following:
  
  /put_array jan_tel wrist #7881
  /put_array jan_tel jump #2141
  /put_array jan_tel code #8008
  /put_array jan_tel foo #8738
  
  /put_array lil_tel car #238
   /put_array lil_tel den #303
   /put_array lil_tel shed #200
   /put_array lil_tel wrist #877
  
  Now, I need to pull the items from the array, which uses /get_array
  
  What I want to do (in pseudo-code is type something like...
  
  "/tel wrist" 
  
  and have it evalute "{world}_tel wrist" and have it return "@tel me=#7881" if I'm in the "jan" world and return "@tel me=#877" if I'm in the "lil" world.
  
  Here's the note on get_array...
  ;------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ;Get array / get 2array : A virtual array function to similate a real array
  ;usage:
  ;get_array("Array name here", I) & get_2array("array name", I, I2)
  ;example get_array("Dir_Array", 43) returns the 43rd element from "Dir_Array"
  ;
  ;------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can scrollback on the terminal itself  if you set its type to  
xterm (I think). I also have these definted with tf5:

/def key_f10 = /dokey_hpageback
/def key_f11 = /dokey_hpage

Per previous threads I started the last week...I have a trigger that
finds exits in a room, but to properly find valid exits, I must first
unset all exit directions... here's the code that does that:

/def -t"You see exits leading*" = \
                /def -Fp2 -t"*see exits leading*" see_exits = \
                /unset north_exit %; /unset south_exit %; \
                /unset east_exit %; /unset west_exit %; \
                /unset northeast_exit %; /unset southeast_exit %; \
                /unset northwest_exit %; /unset southwest_exit %;

Something doesn't appear to be working right, and everytime this
trigger fires, I get the error message:

% def: Redefined macro see_exits

Any ideas?

Again, thanks!

Change the name of the macro from see_exits to unset_exits or something and the problem will go away without affecting your values, as the see_exits is merely the name of the process rather than a variable.

3 questions:
1) Where did 5.1 install?
2) Where is 4.0 installed?
3) Is the path for 5.1 BEFORE the path for 4.0?

Every time you receive the text 'You see exits leading...', you are
creating the macro see_exits, which already exists after the first time,
hence the reason that you receive the redefined warning. I don't really
see why you need to nest your triggers like that, but if it is necessary
you may find the ismacro() function useful.

Also, the %; gets evaluated in the first /def, so the nested /def only
executes the first command. Here's what it looks like to tf:

/def -t"You see exits leading*" =

    /def -Fp2 -t"*see exits leading*" see_exits = /unset north_exit

	/unset south_exit
	/unset east_exit
	...

In order to nest the commands properly, add an extra % for each level,
like:

/unset north_exit %%; /unset south_exit %%; \

A followup question:

Now that my exit variable are set, I would like to choose randomly
from the exits that are TRUE, ignoring those that are false, make
sense?  I seem to think I would need some sort of array or something
to choose from, but it doesn't appear there are arrays for me to store
things in.  I see "lists" but it doesn't seem like they would be a
solution to the above-mentioned problem, any ideas?

Thanks!
-Jason

Try building a string from your exits, then work form that...


/def echoRandArg = /eval /echo %%{$[rand(1,%{#})]}

/echoRandArg n ne e s sw   <-- will echo one of  "n, ne, e, s, sw"

it's not pretty, and may not be proper..  but it works..  try..

/set thisGuy="n e ne s w"
/eval /echoRandArg %thisGuy  <-- will output like above....

so now, instead of all the true false..  init a string to ="", then strcat a 
direction command and a space for
each hit so you get a string like thisGuy above.  <chuckles>  There's a 
million ways to skin a cat ;)

I'll explain the echoRandArg macro and leave ya to see if you can work out 
the rest :)
>From the inside out..  %{#} = argument count, so ya get rand(1,argCount).. 
the $[] tells tf to eval the rand function..
so now ya got the %%{randNumberFromArgCount}..  Here's the tricky part for 
me...  with 1 % there, tf bitches,
with no % tf will echo "{4}" or whatever number..  so to get it to work I 
use the /eval command..  the 2 %'s get
transformed into 1 % before the eval, so I'm evaling "%{4}" (or whatever 
number) which seems to work fine :)
Like I said, tf may complain once..  it's not pretty..  But that's how I'd 
prolly do it..

In a mud I play, I always get a "You walk/run/ride/float/fly/etc west." 
message.  Or something along those lines..
So I keep track of my movements..  a string gets built like, "n n n e n e e 
e s e"  Then if I choose to I can store
that path or traverse it however I like..  I have a /runAway function I use 
when I'm in trouble which will traverse
my path in reverse changing e's to w's, n's to s's, s's to n's, etc..  So I 
can run away in a flash without worry
about running into anything.  It really foils people in PK if ya need to 
flee..  I also get messages if followers
get left behind..  so not only when I do a macro walk can I check to make 
sure that I actually took the step,
I can also trigger to stop and reverse 1 direction if someone gets left 
behind..  I also have a walk back function
to step back single steps..  Makes exploring a lot easier with virtual bread 
crumbs ;)  It took a lot of work
to get timing and things figured in.  But after over 10 years of tweeking 
and improving my scripts I've built
one heck of a mapping system with more options then I need ;)  There should 
be a speedwalk.tf that comes with
tf that you can learn and build from..  So to finish up..  Try working with 
strings ;) Hope this helps!

Hey all,

So I'm working on this automapper, and need to slurp in the string I
get from the look command.  Here's what I'm trying, but I'm having a
hell of a time getting it to work.  This is the Nth variation Ive
tried, so that's why it's a bit convoluted and inconsistant.

When I do
'blah
l
'blah
/recall -w<world> # /2 "*blah*"
/recall -w<world>  <first line number + 1>-<second line number - 1>

it spits out what I want, but the following just gives errors.

/def getLookString = \
   say Finished Oak Cabinets%;\
   look%;\
   say Finished Oak Cabinets%; \
   /let borderTrig= "*Finished Oak Cabinets*" %; \
   /let linea $[/recall -w3k # /2 %{borderTrig}] %;\
   /let lineb $[/recall -w3k # /1 %{borderTrig}] %;\
   /recall -w3k $[(linea+1)]-$[(lineb-1)]
/getLookString

My problem is that I don't understand the reference/dereference rules
all that well, and it's driving me nuts.

Could someone help me out? And/or maybe explain how/when to use the
various ways of referencing variables and macros? (yes, I've read the
/help files, but I'm a java programmer; scripting confuses my little
brain)

BTW: In following up on the external program communication, the only
     way I could get it to block on the read without locking up tf
     was to set up the IPC as a socket connection to localhost, and
     connect to the mapper as if it's two separate worlds (one for
     System.out & System.in, and one for System.err).  It seems to me
     that you can't perform a blocking read of a file, pipe, or
     process (tail -f) using a tf process.  Tried lots of stuff with
     /repeat tfread... and /quote [!'`].

Thanks,

Bill

Is there anything I could do in tf to detect NO action in the mud, so
for example:

If nothing has been sent from mud, do some macro or something?

I thought I saw something like this in the help docs, but now I can't
seem to re-find it!

Thanks!
-Jason

This would be my suggestion, it might not be pretty, but it should work.

/set nothing_variable 0
/sets nothing_toggle 0

;; Simply turns it off, and stops the trigger from firing, which might
make TF overload
;; if too much input is recieved. I honestly don't know if it would or not.
/def nothing_watch_off = /set nothing_toggle 0

;; This starts a 30 second wait till it attempts to fire the macro nothing_check
/def start_nothing_watch = /repeat -30 1 /nothing_check%;  \
/set nothing_toggle 1%;/set nothing_variable 0

;; This trigger fires if any input comes from the MUD, it may not be
pretty, but it should work.
/def -F -E(nothing_toggle) -t"" nothing_trigger = /set nothing_variable 1

;; This fires after the 30 second repeat command goes off, and runs an
if statement to make sure
;; that no input came from the MUD. If none did, it fires the macro
nothing_happened and restarts
;; the ticker.
/def nothing_check = \
/if (nothing_variable=0) /nothing_happened%; /start_nothing_watch%; \
/else /start_nothing_watch%; /endif

/def nothing_happened =

Here's a cleaner version.

/def -t'*' activity_reset_trig = /set activity 0
/repeat -1 i /set activity $[{activity}+1]%;/if ({activity} = 30) /echo
30 seconds have passed with no activity!%;/endif

30 seconds after the last text is received from mud, it triggers once
only.  The timer is reset every time a line is received from mud.

That works.  But an easier way (on most terminals) is to "/set keypad=off"
and turn your keyboard's Num Lock on.

TF has a "loopback" feature that is useful in this situtation.  Define a world
without host or port, and with the -e flag.  When you connect to this world,
tf does not connect to a real server, but instead opens a "connectionless"
socket that echoes back everything you send to it.  Thus:

    /addworld -e test
    /connect test
    Some test text

Hello again,

   Although I found our last reply very helpful (don't doubt it, the
space is there), I still sought further information about this
problem. The resolution was embarassingly simple. As I run tf under
screen I open a screen (via 'screen' no args) and ran 'cat' I hit the
keys in question, saw what the term was getting, and added some /def
-b"^[OQ"=!cast mend beast at me type lines into my .tfrc files. I am
still wondering what was causing TF to see execute whatever I had
bound to F2. If anyone can shed some light on that, it would be
appreciated.

Thanks muchly,

Korf

How can I remove the period from the end of a variable?
I want to pick up my current healtht, maximum health, and then figure
out how much difference there is between the two.

This is the string I get from the MUD for my current health:
A great armoured bear has a health of 1824 / 2120.

This is what I tried:
/def -F -t"A great armoured bear has a health of * /*." = /set
current_health=%{9}%;/set max_health=%{11}

The problem I'm having is simple: the period at the end of the line
from the mud is placed in the variable, and when I try and subtract
one from the other in a /test statement, I get a funky number:

/test {max_health}-{current_health}%;/set diff_health=%{?}

% current_health=1824
% max_health=2120.
% diff_health=0:05:07

Thanks in advance!

Try this:
/def -F -t"A great armoured bear has a health of ([0-9].*]
/[(0-9).*]*." = \
       /set current_health=%{9}%;/set max_health=%{11}

What this will do is accept only numbers at the beginning, and it
should leave out the period at the end. (hopefully)
I haven't tested it, and it's been a little bit since I've done any
serious tf scripting, but it shoud work.  :)

You can learn regex and do it the easy way.

/def -F -mregexp -t'^A great armoured bear has a health of (\d+) \/ (\d
+)' hptrig = /set current_health=%P1%;/set max_health=%P2

This works whether there is a period or not.  I realize it looks hard,
but trust me when I tell you you will save yourself a lot of effort if
you take the time to learn it.

I also recommend you give your triggers a name.  It prevents you making
duplicates, and makes it easier to delete (you just need to know the
name).

Well that works great folks, I've got it figured out fine.

And normally I do name all my triggers, I was just punching that on in
fast for the example.

Another real simple problem I bet, but I'm not sure how to do it. I
want to convert a string into a number, which I can then use in
regular numeral equations. See my excerpt of text from the mud to
understand by what I mean by a string.

There are fifty-four batches of exaar here.

Quite simply in this instance I want to turn the string fifty-four
into the number 54.

Thanks in advance!

I am trying to run TF, via SSH, on a machine running the latest version of
arch7 linux.
I have tf-50b7 right now- but I get the feeling the command usage is not
exactly what the documentation says. Which the documentation seems to be fo=
r
tf-50b5, if that makes a difference. As well as I feel like the
documentation is really horrible and hard to use, like there are not useful=
l
examples of how commands should be used, like there's no context or
something. but that aside here's my problem-
I'm having a lot of problems using things like /hilite and /def and the
.tfrc file etc etc. Now I have a few friends, all of whom use version
tf-40s1.
I tried to switch to version 4.0 stable- and it wont make. It moves along
for a little while and hangs up saying something about an array not having
the right element type.
I tried uncommenting the CC=3Dcc line like the install suggests, but it doe=
snt
help.
I think the problem might be with cc needing to be gcc or something- but I'=
m
a really new user and dont fully understand.
My questions to you are.
A) Should I be trying to move to 4.0 in the first place? and if so how do I
make it make?
B) Should I be using 50b5 insted because thats what the documentation is
for?
C) There's nothing wrong at all with 50b7 and I'm just not smart enough or
an advanced enough user to use the commands? If this is the case- where can
I get assistance with the commands? because all my friends are using 4.0?

Thanks in Advanced boys and girls.

You can continue to use 5.0b7 and still use your friends' advice from 
4.0. I know that my (somewhat complex) scripts, which were written 
for 4.0, work unmodified in 5.0b7.

Just my thoughts,

I'm trying to run tf (and log automatically) off a Cruzer Pen drive. It's the beta Windows binary from Druware.
 
My issue is that I want to log to whatever directory the pen drive is, with a subdirectory of "logs". I can auto-log, what I can't do is work out how to autolog to a specific subdirectory.
 
The problem is that my pen drive gets different letters depending on which computer I'm using. I can be using one of (literally) about 100 computers. SO, there's no way to set an attibute on each computer that I can tag to the drive.
 
Any suggestions.

I think I have an answer but will have to get to a Windows machine at  
the office to check on it.

I am going to be entering is directions from one place to another into
my tf scripts.  Ideally, I would like to enter directions like "n sw w
nw ne n e..." and have some function that reads the strings, and
executes on move after the next with a half second in between each
move, or just a slight pause...

I guess I could just /send n %; /send sw %; /send nw %;  right?  but
that won't account for the slight pause, and it very hard to read
afterwards, in case I need to modify paths...

Any suggestions on the best way to do this?  The small pause is
crucial to keep moving in the MUD that I play.  Any help is much
appreciated!

Thanks,
Stirman

Well, I think I may be on the right path, here's what I've got:

;
;  Speedwalking
;

/def run_dir = /eval /echo %%{$[step]}

/def run = /let step=1 %; \
                /while ($[step] <= %{#}) \
                        /eval /run_dir %%{%1} %; \
                        /let step=$[step+1] %; \
                /done



so if I type "/run blah" it will read the "blah" string and iterate
through the directions, the problem I'm having is the while
expression, I can't get it to stop.  How could I test to see if 'step'
is less than the number of directions in the string I send it?  Make
sense?

I have the /echo in run_dir for debugging..

Also, still not sure how to add a 1 second, or half second delay
between steps...

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Stirman

Beware!

A common mistake is to assume that there is a way to pause in the
middle of evaluating an expression.  There isn't, to my knowledge (I
assume given how very, very often such questions are asked, I would
have noticed such a response on the list).  All you can do is schedule
a macro to execute at a later time.  This means you can't sleep in a
loop; you have to write a delayed tail recursion instead with /repeat
or /quote (usually the former in cases like this).

Understand?

Hmm, well, I saw some references to "pause" a few times in the list
archives, but didn't find any mentions of a 'pause' in the docs, or in
any real code...

Well, if I can detect the 'count' in my string list, like "n s e w"
would equal 4, then I could just use:

/eval /repeat -1 %{count}  /run_dir %;

or something like that, right?

Thanks!

It looks like I should be able to use '#' somehow here, but after
pouring through the docs, I can't figure out how to use it!

for example:

/set blah="n s e w stop"

how can get "5" from the above string?

Thanks again!

I would instead use something similar to what I now notice is actually
inside the help text for /repeat: (semi-tested code follows)

  /def run_cont =3D /let w=3D%1%; /shift%; \
     /if ({#}) /test send({1}, w)%: /shift%; \
               /repeat -1 1 /run_cont %w %*%; /endif
  /def run =3D /run_cont ${world_name} %*

Do you see how this works, with the tail recursion?

Sounds like you need to wait for the prompt before moving?
So hook your moving to the prompt :)

/def -p99999 -1 -h"PROMPT *" pt_hook_aux =3D \
/prompt %%%* %%%; \
/pather_do %-1%%;\
also be sure to undef the prompt hook later or in the def itself=20

That's from a segment of code I use to do this.. Since I do triggers on =
the=20
promt and
the last thing I wish to do if everything is ok is move on, I use=20
priority -p99999.. the "/prompt %*" displays the prompt after it's =
caught, and the pather_do is=20
a function that actually sends the movement command based on which =
direction
I'm headed. Yeah, my speed walks go both ways ;)

As for how to get an argument count, pass blah to a macro that uses %L =
or {L}
or %{L} or something along those lines..

/def countArgs =3D /echo {L}
/eval /countArgs %blah

something like that.. I've used my scripts for well over 10 years, and =
it's been
more then 9 years since I've really looked at them or done any scripting =
in TF.
So the latest TF does bitch a little at my syntax, but they still work.

the MUD I play doesn't use ne, nw, se, sw.. so I use...

/def -i mark =3D \
/if ({1} =3D~ 'r') /echo %% Will continue mapping here.%;\
/else \
/echo %% Will start mapping here.%;\
/set path=3D%;\
/endif %;\
/def -Fp99 -t'*You walk *.' _map_hook1 =3D /map $$[substr(%%L,0,1)] %;\
/def -Fp99 -t'*You ride *.' _map_hook2 =3D /map $$[substr(%%L,0,1)] %;\
/def -Fp99 -t'*You slide *.' _map_hook3 =3D /map $$[substr(%%L,0,1)] %;\
/def -Fp99 -t'*You climb *.' _map_hook4 =3D /map $$[substr(%%L,0,1)] %;\
/def -Fp99 -t'*You run *.' _map_hook5 =3D /map $$[substr(%%L,0,1)] %;\
/def -Fp99 -t'*You swim *.' _map_hook6 =3D /map $$[substr(%%L,0,1)] %;\
/def -Fp99 -t'*You fly *.' _map_hook8 =3D /map $$[substr(%%L,0,1)] %;\
/def -Fp99 -t'*You float *.' _map_hook9 =3D /map $$[substr(%%L,0,1)] %;\
/def -Fp99 -t'*A covered wagon rolls*' _map_hook0 =3D /map =
$$[substr(%%5,0,1)] %;\
/def -Fp99 -t'*You sneak *.' _map_hook7 =3D /map $$[substr(%%L,0,1)]

to catch all my movements.. if I were on a MUD that uses those ne, se, =
ect.. I'd pass the
keyword of the direction to the maping function to reduce the direction =
to the single
or double character direction. On a mud that doesn't report directions =
these would be
prompt hooks looking for "n e s w u d ne se nw sw" and a trigger that =
would pick up on
a "You can't go in that direction" which would get deleted on the next =
prompt if it existed..

Just be carefull, if you get too crazy and don't have things set up =
right the macro's can
debilitate you.. Thankfully my paths can be halted or interupted and =
continued, or resume
maping.. This way when I lead, I'm not leaving followers behind or =
trying to continue on
a path that's not working.


Hope this helps :) good luck!

This script should do what you want. It takes zmud-style paths 
(nsewhjklud) as well as inserting arbitrary commands inside of 
parenthesis... IE...  "5n(open north)ne" would move north 5 times, open a 
door to the north and go north again. The "_speeddelay" parameter effects 
how quickly the path is sent.

After some great feedback from the recent Speedwalking thread, I am
just about done with my speedwalking script, but I still have one
issue.  It looks like I should be able to use '#' somehow here, but
after pouring through the docs, I can't figure out how to use it!

for example:

/set blah="n s e w stop"

how can get "5" from the above string?

The docs talk about:  #    selects the count of positional parameters.

Thanks again!

This wouldn't work because I would have to run it on each computer that I use. The IT staff wouldn't approve of me doing that.

I need a solution that runs 100% from the pen drive, and doesn't involve running things/changing things on the computer.

I'm "allowed" to run tf from work. I'm _not_ "allowed" to alter the computers to do so.

Why not just eliminate a pen-drive and ssh into a remote shell using putty,
which can be run off a pen-drive with no local system alteration,

And would allow you to  save logs on that local machine. There are lots of
freeshell provides such as www.metawire.org and then paid shell providers
for resonable prices such as http://www.tekneeks.net

Can't you just use relative paths?

Testing the theory, I installed the Druware TF4.0s1 (I hate TF5, sorry) to 
my spiffy Swiss Army USB drive, connected to a world, then typed:

/log -w /cygwin/../tf/test.log

And decompiled a char into that log...Seemed to work fine, and voila, no 
drive letter. I assume if you wanted to be neater, you could do it with:

/log -w /cygwin/../tf/logs/test.log

Given that this works, all your loads and everything should work the same 
way:

/load /cygwin/../tf/tf-lib/worldqueue.tf

Either way, the concept works for me.

Let me know if it works out for you.

Gwen,  Honey,

The ONLY change that is being made to the computer is that a couple of
variables are being changed in the memory.  There is NOTHING altered on
the drive itself, nor is there any need to run it on all the different
computers that you use.

The instructions specifically say that the files are on the pen drive.

Hi,

Does anyone by any chance know this MUD or maybe recognize the issue I have with it ?

Thing is, since about two-three months I am no longer seeing my password prompt or any of the questions the MUD is asking me when creating a NEW character. I've tried to play around with the /addworld -T settings but to no avail. I've tried previous 5.0 beta versions but also to no avail. Seems like they've changed something on the server-side but I'm unable to figure out what it is ...

Maybe someone onhere does ? Would be greatly appreciated ...

Materia Magica uses the telnet go-ahead option (I believe that's the one 
it is). If you do a "/set telopt on" before you connect, you can see this 
the negotiation.

The attached file demonstrates how to catch the MIP codes embedded 
in the prompts that Materia Magica sends to the portal and java client.

You need to make sure that "lp" is set to "off", which you can do by using 
the world type of "lpp" in the addworld command:

/addworld -Tlpp <...>

This should be enough to get you started...

Please, first, excuse me if this was covered in the list previously,
but I searched through the archives and could not find anything.

My question is this...I'm running 50b7, and I have everything set up
the way i like it, separate input from output, (visual mode) and so
on, but here's what I'm looking for, and I don't know if it's
possible.

I would like to be able to have a separate input buffer for each world
that I'm connected to, so that if I start typing a pose, say, in one
world (World A), and want to switch to another in the middle of the
pose, and type something to the new world(World B), I can have both a
blank input window for world B, and a partially filled input buffer
for World A, and when I go back to world A, the pose I was working on
would still be there for me to complete and send.

 As it is now, I have to finish whatever I'm typing in one world,
before I can swtich to a new world and type there.


Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Tracy

Well, I'm not sure how to do -precisely- what you're requesting, but I know
how I do it.

I believe its the script kbstack.tf, if you load that in, you can hit
ESC-DOWN-ARROW to store your currently input line in a stack, then you can
type a new line.

Then you can hit ESC-UP-ARROW to restore the last thing you put in.  You can
put multiple lines in there too, its a FILO (first in last out.)

It's a partial solution to whacha wanna do...

Hello,
   I remember seeing, at some point in the past, references to a script
that would allow you to do scrollback in TF 4.0s1.  I searched the
archives but I could not find any reference to it, only to TF 5 builtin
scrollback.  Can anybody point me in the right direction with this?

Thanks

--Hair

I have a tinyfugue run on linux.
Basicly there is one process have 6 connection, all of them run /quote
repeatly and a few trigger with regex pattern. After a while, the
memory usuage is above 60M, another tinyfugue run a /repeat with no
memory problem.
Is that normal?

;Version 2.20 Galvin

;PgUp brings you into the scroll back; places the world in the background;
;     also it pages up thru the scroll back one page at a time.
;PgDn Does the same as above except it doesn't activate scroll back.

;NOTES:
;Make sure scroll_history_size is set to the what ever /histsize is set

;the /FG and /BG may cause problems for people using mulitple worlds.

;This function is to be used if you want to write stuff directly into the input

;USAGE:
;InputHist_MultiLine('this is a string of text', ScreenWidth)
;The string will be broken into even segments of screen width
;NOTE: You need to write stuff you type into the keyboard into the history buffer
;      if you want to see it in the scroll back.
;to make such a macro that can catch every you type this is how:
;/def -ag -mregexp -F -h'SEND ^.*$' chat_send = \
;  /test InputHist_MultiLine(strcat('> ',{P0}), 80)%;\

  Gwen,

Did you get this working satisfactorily?  I just bought a new windows  
machine for another project, and can fix any issues you had if you  
still need it.

I have some macros defined for one world, as such:
 
;;; Move (to start flying again)
/def -F -w'ss' -p7 speed = \
   /if ({#} > 0) \
      /send speed %* %;\
   /else \
      /send speed 1 %;\
   /endif

I'd like  them to be defined for exactly _two_ worlds, now (I'm creating a second character in the same world).
 
Is there some way to define two worlds in the same definition, without either making it "all worlds" or, two copies of these macros.
 
I only use one file (.tfrc) because I use it on many computers, so, I can't load the same sub file for more than 1 world.
 
Gwen

Hi, haven't found this in the list so far, so asking away :)

Is there a way to implement an ordering of worlds?  For example:  I logon to MU1, then MU2, then MU4.  I'd like to be able to scroll through these worlds using the default keys (esc B, esc F) and go MU1, MU2, MU4, or reverse that.  

I'd also like to be able to have, say MU1, MU2, MU4 open, and then login to MU3 and have that placed between MU2 and MU4.  

Is such a setup possible?  The reason I ask is cause MU1 and MU2 are related (work on one moves to the other) and MU3 and MU4 are for just gaming. Sort of a Order of Importance feature.

Thanks for any help folks can give:)

Jon

I manage things like this by using (abusing?) the fact that a /def 
'type' can be handled as a regex match. I have a standard world-naming 
scheme (the first 2 letters are based on the game name, the next two on 
the login name, and there is an optional 'x' suffix for SSL-enabled 
worlds). The type field of each world, when it gets defined, is a 
hierarchy based on these, and can be matched with /def's -T argument. 
But an example will probably show this better than my description:

;;; World 'Foo', designated 'fo', character 'Bar', designated 'ba'

; Basic world login - no character

/test addworld("fo", "tiny.mux.fo.", "foo.domain.tld", "1234", \
     "", "", "", "")

; Normal login for Bar, password sekr1t

/test addworld("foba", "tiny.mux.fo.", "foo.domain.tld", "1234", \
     "Bar", "sekr1t", "", "")

; SSL-based login for Bar, password sekr1t
/test addworld("fobax", "tiny.mux.fo.ssl.", "foo.domain.tld", "1235", \
     "Bar", "sekr1t", "", "x")

; Define a fall-through hook, priority 5, to colorize the '<OOC>' text
; of any line that begins with that, in any Foo world.

/def -Fp5 -P0xCgreen -mregexp -T'\\.fo\\.' -t'^<OOC>' h_fo_ooc =

;;; End example

Note that I normally only bother having one of the 'aabb' and 'aabbx' 
worlds defined, so I don't bother with a 'type' field for '.aabb.', but 
it would be trivial to do if necessary. Basically, treat the Type as a 
dot-separated list of properties a world can have, and just make sure 
you don't have any overlaps... I used '.ssl.' above to point out that 
these can designate 'features', not just login information (in fact, I 
haven't bothered tagging my SSL-based worlds with it, since I haven't 
needed to set up any SSL-world-only triggers, but I do have '.mcp.' for 
MCP-aware worlds).

I recently sat down to redo a few scripts for TF5.  I am now over thinking
and need a bump.

I want to match a line that has 6 variables, and sometimes 7.  What would
be the best way to achieve this?
Something like:

/def -wMUD -mregexp -t^(([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+)|([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+))

Having the 7 variable string first and grabbing variables with P2-P8 works
fine when there are 7 variables.  When there are 6 of course it nulls all
7 variables.  So this doesn't really work.

I know I'm going about this the wrong way, brain is fried, any help would
be great to shove me back on track.

Mark

You can use the regexp symbol ? for this. The ? allows the pattern to
match whether the text before the ? was there or not.

An example using 2 or 3 variables:

/def -mregexp -t"^([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ?([0-9]+)?" = \
    /eval /echo p1: "%{P1}" p2: "%{P2}" p3: "%{P3}"


1 2
p1: "1" p2: "2" p3: ""
1 2 3
p1: "1" p2: "2" p3: "3"

I think I've reported this before, but I've now written a little server
to make it easier to test clients. Its at dum.acc.umu.se 5445.

If MCCP is used and the server closes the stream, tf-5.0b7 gets stuck in
a recursive loop until it crashes.

The bug can be provoked by sending
"stopmccp" to the test server.

I changed the Z_STREAM_END case (line 2950) to this:
{
    z_stream *zstream = xsock->zstream;
    /* handle stuff inflated before stream end */
    count = (char*)zstream->next_out - outbuffer;
    xsock->zstream = NULL;
    received += handle_socket_input(outbuffer, count);
    /* prepare to handle noncompressed stuff after
     * stream end */
    buffer = (char*)zstream->next_in;
    count = zstream->avail_in;
    /* clean up zstream */
    inflateEnd(zstream);
    FREE(zstream);
    xsock->flags &= ~SOCKCOMPRESS;
}

That is, it sets xsock->zstream to NULL before the recursive call to
handle_socket_input to solve that one.


The second bug I think I've already reported is this case (as shown
with emulation=debug):
^[[1;37;40mBright white ^[[1;31mBright red.^[[37m^M
> ^M^@^[[31mStill bright red^M

(after the ">" character IAC EOR is also sent, and after one second
"^M^@" and the rest of the text is sent).
The problem is that "Still bright red" is not shown as bright red, but
as normal red. It can be tested in the test server with "testansi".
(It works fine in 4.0b1). I have not tried to fix that one, but I assume
it is the prompt that causes tf to forget about the bold/bright bit.


My intention with the testserver is that it should be a tool for client
makers to easily test various things that can come out from a mud
server. It currently has few test cases (one can however make the server
output anything with the sendasis and senddata commands). I'm open for
suggestions for other commands that would be useful to test a client.

My next target with it is to add support for testing some vt102 control
sequences, those that are used in some muds like cursor movement and
scrolling regions and "DEC graphics" and some documentation, besides the
online help.

Regards,
/Sebastian

An alternative, for simpletons like me, would be to suck in the whole line
using a pattern that matches both cases and then use regmatch() on the
possible cases.  Something like this (not real code, and not tested):

/def -mregexp -t"<general pattern>" = \
        /if regmatch(pattern1,{P0}) \
                do something %; \
        /elseif regmatch(pattern2,{P0}) \
                do something else %; \
        /endif
        ...

Hey there Gwen,

If the macro is for one world, many characters then it just needs a bit of tweeking.
Under the assumption that you want one character having one setting and the other character a different setting you could so something like the fillowing (Please note that this is not written in TFscript but I will try to use actual tf variables.

<put code that is common to both here>
if ${world_character}=~ "Maggie"
 <code for doing what ever Maggie needs done if she is selected>
 <example>
  /let speed_maggie = %1;
elseif ${world_character}=~ "Elizabeth"
 <code for doing what ever Elizabeth needs done if she is selected>
 <exmaple>
  /let speed_elizabeth = %1;
endif
<put code that is common to both here>

While it's not the same thing you're trying I used the same sort of techinique for creating a logging script.

It's rather nifty because then I can do individual logs, the only warning is that if a log already exists for that day then it tf appends to it.
/def rplog=/set logFileName= \
~/RolePlaying/Region/${world_character}/Logs/$[ftime("%Y-%m-%d",time())].${world_charact
er}.log%; \
 /log -w${world_name} %{logFileName}

Hope that helps you in some small way.

Is your query resolved? If not here's something you can try

On on your pen drive create a .bat file
The contents of the bat file are something like this:
set tfpath=%~dp0
echo /set myTFpath="%tfpath%" > mypath.tf
tf %1

Then inside your tf initialization file (what ever that may be) add the following line.

/require mypath.tf

And voila, you're done. I haven't testing to see if it works, but I do know that the bat file itself does write the correct path name to the mypath.tf file. In theory once tf handles the require mypath.tf there should now be a global variable called myTFpath.

Also one other thing to note, do /help environment as there might be an environment variable you can use without having to do the bat file thing.

Hope that helps in some small way.

I've got a trigger like this:

/def main=\
    /def -p100 -n1 -mregexp -t"^(?i)([^ ]+) says '([A-Za-z0-9\,\.\ \!\?]+)'" _saywhat=\
        /set name %%P1 %%; /set said %%P2

Anyone know the comparable way to do this with glob? Is it so much more faster that it's worth it?

This does most of what you want, but it holds the single quotes ' around
the message, something I already had for tells that I modified for says.

/DEF -F -p9 -ag -t"*says '*" _saywhat = \
	/SET name=%1 %; /SET said=%{-2}


Or, if you need the name lower cased you can

/SET name=$[tolower(%{1})]

Using tf5, you have the option of precompiling your regexps which 
speeds them up considerably.

Ooo... I like that. Any known concerns to triggers, security wise? I've 
been attempting to trick some of mine into executing sometihng 
arbritrarily, but not having much luck. I realize this question is very 
broad, but I'd be obliged to see some examples of things that are Bad (TM).

Not that insecurity on unsecured plain-text telnet is really an issue...

Thanks, Mike... I just switched that on too. It's /set defcompile=on if 
anyone else needs.

I haven't had this trigger fire randomly and the mud I usually play has
its fair share of jokers who try to get badly coded trigs to fire.

The speed difference between globs and regexps has been widely
exaggerated.  Regexps are only slightly slower than globs (especially in
tf 5 with PCRE).  So you shouldn't jump through hoops to replace a regexp
with a glob; if a regexp is more natural, use it.  In particular, if
replacing a regexp with a glob would require you to write additional code
(e.g., to strip quotes in the example above), the cost of that additional
code will dwarf any saving you might have gotten by using the glob.

In 5.0, regexps are never compiled more than once.  (In 4.0, this was true
only of regexps in triggers; regexps in macro bodies (i.e. in regmatch())
had to be compiled each time they were used.)

%defcompile affects compilation of macro bodies, not regexps (except where
regexps are inside macro bodies).  And a given macro body or regexp is
still never compiled more than once; %defcompile only determines whether
that one time is when the macro is defined or when the macro is first
executed.

Greetings,

i'd like to have a macro that simply increases a number. i've got some variables that look like:

/set timer_plant 1
/set timer_elixir 1
/set timer_salve 1

one thing that i could use is:

/def increase_plant = /set timer_plant=$[++timer_plant]

but i don't want to have a macro with three almost identical lines.
i'd like to have something like:

/set timer_%{P0}=$[++timer_%{P0}]

and then use

/def increase_timer = \
  /if ( regmatch(^(plant|elixir|salve)$,%{1} ) /set timer_%{P0}=$[++timer_%{P0}] %; \
  /else /echo % Use /increase_timer <plant|elixir|salve> %; \
  /endif

like: /increase_timer plant

the error is: % increase_timer: expression syntax error: expected operator or ']', found '%'.

i've looked around and tried alot, but i can't find the solution for that problem.

any ideas?

thankfull for any help,

              qubax

The ++ operator modifies the variable; there's no need to assign its value
back to the variable.  Thus:
    /def increase_plant = /test ++timer_plant

Here, you're trying to increment a variable named "timer_%{P0}"; that's not
a valid variable name.  You seem to be expecting the %{P0} to be replaced
first, but it's not.  To replace the %{P0} before evaluating the expression,
you would need to use this (not recommended):

    /eval /set timer_%{P0}=$$[++timer_%{P0}]

or, better yet, by using /test instead of $[...] to evaluate the expression:

    /test timer_%{P0} := ++timer_%{P0}

But, as I described ++ already, all you really need is:

    /test ++timer_%{P0}

> and then use

>   /endif
> 
> like: /increase_timer plant

Also:
1. You need quotes around the regexp (as far as the parser is concerned, it's
   just a string)
2. In an expression, it's easier to use {1} syntax than %{1} syntax
Thus:

    /def increase_timer = \
	/if (regmatch("^(plant|elixir|salve)$", {1}) \
	    /test ++timer_%{P0}%; \
	/else \
	    /echo %% Use /%0 <plant|elixir|salve>%; \
	/endif

Is there any way to determine from within tf (specifically to access 
macros) which terminal I'm using.

I sometimes use Eterm, and sometimes use Konsole. Eterm supports 256 
colors and Konsole (at least so far) does not.

What I'd like to do is set up my color macros to make use of the 265 
colors only when running Eterm.

Gwen

You can access environment variables from within tf directly. The
information, you are looking for, should be available in the TERM
variable. So you could try something like this:

; Terminal detection
/if ( {TERM} =~ "Eterm" )                 \
;   we're running in Eterm
    /echo Lot's of colours available. %;  \
/else                                     \
    /echo Hmmm. Dunno. %;                 \
/endif

hth,
Philipp

The TERM environment variable ought to be set to the terminal emulation mode 
(eg. "xterm", "vt100", etc), not the name of the terminal program you are 
using. I think your best hope is to look for a variable that only certain 
programs would set. For example, mlterm sets the MLTERM variable. 
Gnome-terminal and eterm might set GNOME_TERMINAL and ETERM, respectively. 
Grep the output of 'set' in each program and see what can be used.

Rather than looking for a variable already existing, I'd look at the 
manpage to find out what the .xxxrc file is for each terminal and add 
a line to explicitly set something there.

Although if you're connecting to a remote server and running tf there,
these aren't likely to be available.

I alternate between xterm and putty for MUDding; both of these set TERM
to xterm, but don't set any useful variables that I could find.  So I
put this in my .bash_profile:

# Ping the client ID

stty -echo
echo -ne '\005'
read -t1 CLIENT_ID
export CLIENT_ID
stty echo

This IDs the terminal client and puts the result into $CLIENT_ID.  While
I haven't found a Linux terminal that uses this yet, putty does, for
which I am very grateful.  It does cause a one-second delay when I log
in, but I can deal with that.

I should mention as well that Eterm does set TERM to Eterm (as in
/usr/share/terminfo/Eterm), which ought to be pretty reliable for
detecting it. :)

More correctly, PuTTY sets TERM to what you tell it to set it to. Open 
up PuTTY, go to Category->Connection->Data and see the Terminal-type 
string. You'll need to separately set that on the sessions that you 
have saved, as well as on the Default Settings session if you want 
something to be sent on everything. Any sessions that you save after 
changing it for Default Settings (and save) will inherit the new value.

HTH,
Mike

I've started using TinyFugue on Mac OS X, and I'm trying to set up an  
extensive system of keybindings.  I'd like to use both the numeric  
keypad and the function keys, and also all of the modifier keys:  
apple/command, option, control, shift (and combinations even).  I'm  
having trouble figuring all this out!  Could someone provide some  
examples for things like keypad= and option-F3 and apple-shift- 
keypad6 and all that?

	First you want to declare your terminal type in
Terminal:Preferences.  I use xterm-color.  Then I would also make sure you
are using strict vt100 keypad behavior, Terminal:Window Settings:Emulation
or Control click (right-click) the term window for Window Settings.  From
there it's just a matter of setting up your definitions.

;;; Keypad enter key now acts like return
/def -b'\033OM' = /dokey newline

/def key_nkp1 = /send -wNAME sw%;
/def key_nkp2 = /send -wNAME s%;
/def key_nkp3 = /send -wNAME se%;
/def key_nkp4 = /send -wNAME w%;
/def key_nkp5 = /send -wNAME l%;
/def key_nkp6 = /send -wNAME e%;
/def key_nkp7 = /send -wNAME nw%;
/def key_nkp8 = /send -wNAME n%;
/def key_nkp9 = /send -wNAME ne%;

/def -b'\033Ol' key_nkp+ = /send -wNAME u%;
/def -b'\033Om' key_nkp- = /send -wNAME d%;

/def -b'\033On' key_nkp. = /echo -aB *** TARGET = %cml_target

/def -b'\033Op' key_nkp0 = \
	/if (name_pet == 1) \
		/send pets kill %name_target %; \
	/else /send kill %name_target %; \
	/endif %; \
    /load -q name/dead.tf %; \
    /set cml_combat=1 %;

/def key_f1 = /send -wNAME use push%; scan%;
/def key_f2 = /send -wNAME gac%; dg%;
etc...

	If you do change your term type later, it will without a doubt
mess up a good chunk of your definitions as the key codes are not the
same.  Using xterm is probably your best bet, but you can try things out
with the others.  However Ansi won't get you very far.  Hope this helped
you out.

	Oh the name stuff is just NAME = world name and name = id for trig
set like bnm_ = bob in NastyMud.  I like to be able to run a few worlds in
one window, however I only use the keypad for the one, and I like to be
able to move around and attack without switching all the time.  I know
it's odd.

Mark

I'm looking for some information on matching by position in a line, if 
such a thing is possible in tf.
I have a (random) number of lines that will include information 
something like this:

 26 D       medium small light     green  pyramid very slightly flawed-- 0
 27 D       tiny         light     green  pyramid perfect         -- 0
 28 F sharp medium small light     green  pyramid perfect         -- 0
 29 A       very large   light     green  pyramid perfect         -- 0
 30 B       medium large light     green  pyramid slightly flawed -- 0

As you can see, elements in each line vary as to length, but (at least 
if you have things set to fixed width) they're each a specific distance 
apart from line to line.

So, what I'd want to do is...say...count over 4 spaces and then take the 
next characters up to 8 characters long, and so on.

Is there anything in TF that can deal with this? I figure maybe regexp 
matching, but, if not, something else?

Gwen

Assume:

/set Afflictions_broken_leg_right 1

; cured
/def -i -p1 -F -mregexp -t"^The bones in your (left|right) (arm|leg) mend\.$" mended_armleg = \
  /if (!Afflictions_broken_%{P2}_%{P1} & Afflictions_broken_%{P2}) /cured_broken_%{P2} %; \
  /else /cured_broken_%{P2}_%{P1} %; \
  /endif

trigger gets fired by: The bones in your right leg mend.

but it seems that it doesn't like the %{P2} or %{P1} in the if condition.



The exact error-message is:

% mended_armleg: condition syntax error: expected operator or ')', found '%'.

Does someone have an idea, how this can be solved?

Thanks,

qubax

you could try to have a look at:

/def -mregexp -t"^(\d+)\s(A|B|C|D|E|F)\s(sharp|\s+)\s(tiny|medium(?: small|large)|(?:very )large)\s(light)\s+(green|blue|red)\s(pyramid|cube)\s((?:very )slightly flawed|perfect)" get_line_information = \
  /set number %{P1} %; \
  /set capital %{P2} %; \
  /set sharpness %{P3} %; \
  /set adjective %{P4} %; \
  /set alignment %{P5} %; \
  /set colour %{P6} %; \
  /set form %{P7} %; \
  /set condition %{P8}

i'm not sure if that is completly correct and working as it's written
up there, but i hope it's a help for you to start with.

Assume:

/set variable1 1
/set variable2 variable1

how can i access the value of variable1 via variable2?
What i'd like to have is something like:
   /evalcommand variable2 -> 1

I've tried to do things like:

/eval /echo $[variable2] -> variable1
/eval /echo $[$[variable2]] -> variable1   ? why?


but i can't find i way to use that output directly for a new
evaluation.

i've been looking in the lists and couldn't find a hint for my
problem.

Thanks for any bit of help from you,

I love real programmers!!!
 
 I just don't think that way :). As I at least hinted, I had meant to match for each category on a separate pass through, rather than matching all the elements in the line after just one pass!
 
 Thank you _SOOO_ much -- I can fiddle with it and get it to work, now.

Hello!

I'm writing to see if there have been any attempts at creating some
kind of IP-to-IP chat support to TinyFugue.  I'm trying to find a Mac
OS X mud client that will support this in the same way the MudMaster
2000 or zMUD do, and I have had absolutely no luck.  I've always loved
TinyFugue, and started to use it as my OS X client, but I'm still
unable to find any client-to-client chat.

There's a specific protocol to MM2k chat, and it is pretty well described on:

http://www.mud-master.com/Download/MM_Chat_Protocol.txt

How difficult would it be to implement some sort of support for this
protocol in TinyFugue?

Thanks in advance for your feedback!

That's if I read the spec right and the command codes are not expressed
in text-based numbers. tf has a habbit of filtering out control codes
in certain emulation modes.

I may, of course, be full of crap. :)

Does TF have any sort of support for recursion (which is being defined as functions calling themselves).

A programmer whose helping me with some macros wanted me to ask about that.

I know it has support of loops, but, I'm not sure what he means by the above, other than maybe he wants to know if macros can call themselves?

Hi,

Yes, it does.
Consider sth. like the Fibonacci numbers:

/def fib =                                         \
    /if ( {1} <= 1 )                               \
        /return 1 %;                               \
    /else %;                                       \
        /return fib( {1} - 1 ) + fib( {1} - 2 ) %; \
    /endif

It works:

/eval /echo $[ fib(25) ]
121393

Although I would recommend to use loops whereever possible, since this
should result in better performance. Additionally, I do not know, how
many levels of recursion are supported by TF.

hth,
Philipp

Aside from memory limitations &c. (which are probably
system-dependent), there's also a user-settable limit:

  Help on: special variables: %max_recur
    max_recur=100
            Maximum depth of recursive macro calls or triggers.  This helps
            prevent infinite macro loops.  A value of 0 will allow unlimited
            recursion.

Sorry if I seem confused as to what you are trying to do, but I think this might get you going in the right direction. 
 
/def foo=/let a=5%;/let b=$[a]%;/eval /echo $[b]%; 
 if you do /foo it should echo out 5. 
 
/def foo = /let a=5%;/let b=$[a]%;/eval /echo $[b]%;/if (b==5) /echo "b 
is 5"%;/endif 
 if you do /foo it should echo out 5 <new line> "b is 5" 
 
Hope this helps.

Here's some additional information that might get you even closer to what you're trying to do. 
/def -i -p1 -F -mregexp -t"^The bones in your (left|right) (arm|leg) mend\.$" m 
ended_armleg = /if ($Afflictions_%P1_%P2) /echo Hello world!%;/endif 
 
What the above does is now complain about: 
 macro not defined: Afflictions_right_leg 
 
What you would need to do in this case is define the missing macro and have it do what ever it is suppose to do to the right 
leg once triggered. For example it could set some variable or what ever. 
 
Also check in side your tf-lib as there are some macros doing some pretty funky stuff that seems like the thing you're trying 
to do. 
 
Again, hope this helps. :)

My husband and I are co-working on some code in TF. Assorted questions 
will be flying at the group as his Fortran programming skills, and my 
MUSHcode skills combine to try to write TF macros.

Below is a macro meant to step through groups of numbers and combine 
then in different ways. I think we may have managed to hork up some TF 
syntax. Here's the errors we get:
% combination: warning: '=' following space is part of value.
% combination: warning: '=' following space is part of value.
% combination: macro syntax error: expected /endif, found end of body.


/def combination = \
/test NUM_FILLED := {1} %;\
/test POS_FILLED := {2} %;\
/test LEN := {3} %;\
/test OLD := {4} %;\
/if (NUM_FILLED < LEN) \
  /test NF := NUM_FILLED + 1 %;\
  /let NEW_POS = POS_FILLED + 1 %;\
  /while (NEW_POS <= {NUM_GROUP} + NUM_FILLED + 1 - LEN) \
    /test VALUE := get_array(OLD, NEW_POS) %;\
    /test put_array('COMBINE', NF, VALUE) %;\
    /combination(NF, NEW_POS, LEN, OLD) %;\
    /test ++NEW_POS %;\
  /done %;\
/else \
  /unset STRING %;\
  /let M = 1 %;\
  /while (M <= LEN) \
    /test STRING1 := strcat(STRING, " ", get_array('COMBINE', M)) %;\
    /set STRING := STRING1 %;\
  /done

I also get the "expected endif" in another section of unrelated code. 
What am I doing "wrong" in setting up these if/elseifs?

    /cd /home/goldmoon %;\
    /set HOME=/home/goldmoon %;\

In both instances, you need a trailing /endif to close the if blocks.

Take out the spaces around each '=' to make the warnings go away.  See

You won't get the results you expect using /let to do math, you need to use /test.

/def xxzzy = \
  /let new_pos=%;\
  /let m=1%;\
  /test new_pos := pos_filled+1%;\

The "/let new_pos=" assigns a value to 'new_pos' that is null, but is local to
the scope of the macro, so that when you use it later on in the macro it stays
in the local scope and you don't accidentally make it a global variable.

If you are incrementing for loops, you can also use the C type syntax ie:-

  /test ++pos_filled

to increment the variable.

Is there a way to gag the output of a command sent to any world?  For 
example, I want to send a command to a game, but I don't care what the 
results of that command are and I don't want them to scroll up my screen 
because using that many muscles to eye movement might make me lose some 
calories and thus my perfect, balloonish figure.

Signed,
The Fattest Ball on Earth.

Some time ago Galvin posted array code to the list. Here's the part to 
putting entries into the array:

;;; If you use text not containing other characters than letters, 
numbers and _
;;; you may also use this as an simple key-value hash list
;;; e.g. /set_array weapon s1 sword_with_a_very_long_id
;;;
;;; /def wield = /get_array weapon %1%;wield %?
;;;
;;; Usage:
;;; instead of: wield sword_with_a_very_long_id
;;; just use: /wield s1
;;;
;;; Some Examples:
;;; /test put_array('test_array', 1, 367382)
;;; /test put_array('test_array', 2, 'a string')
;;; /test echo(get_array('test_array', 1))
;;; /test echo(get_array('test_array', 2))

/def put_array = \
 /IF (strlen({3}) > 0) \
   /set _%1_array_%2=%3%;\
 /ELSE \
   /unset _%1_array_%2%;\
 /ENDIF%;\

I'd like to be able to put entries that include special characters. 
Something more than "letters, numbers, and _". In particular, I'd like 
to be able to put in pound "#" characters. He uses variables to hold the 
array elements. Is this a limitation of TF, that you can't use a pound 
sign in a variable name? Or, is there some way to wedge the pound sign 
in there? (maybe escaping it in some way?)

Tinyfugue has no way of knowing whether the text that it receives 
from the MUD is regular MUD scroll or whether it's a direct result of 
the last command.

There's really 3 ways that you can gag output of a command. Each is 
ugly in its own way.

1) time-based...send foo, don't show me anything for n seconds

2) delimiter-based...send foo, don't show me anything until the MUD 
sends XXXXX text. For this, you could either use the bottom line from 
a MUD listing, or you could have it send "smile" and trig on the 
emote.

3) line-by-line gag...I know that command foo results in text of the 
pattern xxxx, so gag that specific text, either using a 1-shot trig, 
or using a timer on the trigger.

The line-by-line gag at least will let you see unrelated MUD text, 
while the other two are horse blinders that let you see nothing. I 
would always want to have a timer that turns off the gag trigs 
(undefine them) even if you use 1-shot or delimeters...there's always 
the chance that something will stop the trig from firing, & you don't 
want to be blind.

Hope this helps,
Mike

Hi,

I want a one shot trigger which has a definable lifetime.
eg.

/def -F -t'Online' online = \
  /def <TIME-X> -F -1 -t'Connected' catchall = \
    /send tell friends hello peeps

So after recieving the the text "Online" it would have X of time to
recieve the "Connected" text and fire the catchall trigger. If X seconds
pass then the catchall trigger would remove itself.

I tried the code below which kind of works but has potential bugs in it:

/def deftime = \
  /let time=%1%; \
  /def %-1%; \
  /eval /set deftime_%?=%?%; \
  /eval /repeat -0:0:%1 1 /unset deftime_%?%%%;/test undefn(%?)%; \
  /eval /edit %-1%%%;/kill %?

So below would use the deftime trigger and catchall trigger would expire
after 5 seconds:

/def -F -t'Online' online = \
  /deftime 5 -F -1 -t'Connected' catchall = \
    /send tell friends hello peeps

This obviously doesn't make sense on multishot triggers.

I was wondering if anyone could think of a better way of doing this?

Cheers,

Sam

You missed the fourth option, which to me is the best: gag everything 
until next prompt. How is it done? Try the following:

/def -q -h'SEND *' start_gagging=\
   /def -ag -F -t'*' command_gag%;\
   /def -1 -h'PROMPT *' end_gag=/undef command_gag

Note: this does the gagging for every command, you might want to be 
more specific in the send-hooks pattern.

Does the textencode function do what you want?

I have a question about matching patterns across multiple lines from
the mud.  If I get output from the mud similar to this:

blah blah blah blah blah what I want
to match. blah blah.

any ideas how to get the match?  I am walking through the world, looking
for specific items in the room description and want to hilite.  Thanks

I want to be able to automatically hitlite the names  of everyone on a
specific list on a list,
EX:
Sir Maleki, Decus est Vita is under divine protection.
Zartuuz is under divine protection.
Fidai Tim, Bear of the Battlefield is under divine protection.

And have that same hilite appear on another very similar list.
EX:
Sir Maleki, Decus est Vita [At: Nirvana ].
Zartuuz [At: Southern river quays ].
Fidai Tim, Bear of the Battlefield [At: Pool in the greenwood ].

There is also a macro in one of David Moore's collections.

However, as far as I can tell, you can have anything you want in a variable
ie:-

/def joe = /set fred +|<>?!@#\$%%^&*()-=\\[];'/., %; /set fred

Notice I had to escape the $ and the \ and double up the %, but this is
standard in TF macros.

The only limitation is which character the programmer has chosen to use as the
delimeter in their arrays.

OK, this is most likely gonna be crazily complex. I'm going to include
full excerpts from my MUD as examples to show what I want to do.

This is the BBW list:
Aja, Angelos, Azroth, Bowdyn, Castigere, Chiron, Christox, Dinamoria, Edorec,
Elmak, Erina, Esprii, Ester, Genesis, Hitman, Jeward, Karsha, Nytewhisp,
Toranth, Uwoiame, Waffy, Zakath.

This is the Protected list:
Waffy, the commoner is under divine protection.
Initiate Edorec of Springdale is under divine protection.
Sir Azroth of Springdale is under divine protection.

What I want to do is take the specific names of the people on the
Protected list and hilite them. As you can see, on the Protected list
there are prefixes and suffixes on the actual names of people. Thus, I
figure the BBW list can come into play by providing the actual names
of everyone online. However...I have no idea how to make it all work.

Thanks in advance! (I hope!)
 - Elmak

If everyone on the Protected list is on the BBW list, you can parse the
BBW list, then search your protected output for matching strings.
Since it is probably not something that you would want running all the
time (the setting up of the list) you could bind it to an alias (such
as whatever you use to look at the protected list).

Save the matching strings into a text file, that you use to do the
hiliting.

Shouldn't be more than 2 or 3 scripts to get it all to work together.
The scripts, I am too brain dead right now to even attempt as it's
finals time!

I'm reading the info on tfio and trying to work out how to do something, but, it's all coming across as greek to me :).

What I'd like to do is open a file, write very specific text to it that is gotten after sending a command to a particular world, and then close the file.

So, it would look something like this:

tfopen(grab.txt,w)
/send -w grabtext
tfclose(however you work out the handle)

Gwen

It's easier than the helpfile makes it look.

/def write_to_file_macro = \
   /test file:=tfopen("grab.txt","a") %; \
   ;; "a" for append mode if that's what you want, otherwise "w"
   /test tfwrite(file,"This is some text.  I can also write a @{var} to
file too") %; \
   /test tfclose(file)

I would advise you write macros to capture the text you want to write into
variables and then write them to file in the format you want when you're
ready.  Trying to get the tfopen and tfclose to write exactly when you
want them (i.e. when the MUD is sending the command output) risks it
firing off at the wrong time or writing spurious text to your file.

	Thank you.  In addition how would I go about using %P1, as in:

/set var=$[decode_attr("@{Cred}%P1")]

	Obviously that doesn't work because it's treated as text.  Any
suggestions?  Thanks again.

Mark

Hello,

assuming i've the precise line that i'm looking for (for instance: You
may eat another plant.) What's the fastest way to trigger it?

/def -msimple -t"You may eat another plant." rebal_plant = ...

or

/def -mglob -t"You may eat another plant." rebal_plant = ...

or

/def -mregexp -t"^You may eat another plant\.$" rebal_plant = ...

Manual says that glob should be faster than regexp, but if i've the
precise line, is 'simple' even faster?

Seems that i start to get into problems with fast enough triggering
for some reason.

Thanks,

qubax

I'd like to set up a few triggers that depend on the char name. My
idea was to use something like:

/set charname=dummy
/eval /def -mregexp -t"Damn %{charname}" swearing = ignore

any ideas how to properly do that?

thanks for your help
qubax

I wrote a little trigger to automatically remind me of area repops on my
MUD of choice, Aardwolf.  It uses a similar structure to what I think
you're trying to do, so it may help you somewhat.  It's attached - hope
the attachment works OK.  And hope you find this useful.

The MUD I play requires that I change out entire suits of armor regularly, for a
three character crew that I run.  I am currently doing this using the quote
command, to send a text file full of the commands to the MUD.  Each file is
unique and contains references to variables (hence the /eval), but here is the
/def I am currently using to /quote all three files to the MUD.

/def fgear = \
  /quote -wsy /eval '"~/tf/data/fgear_sy.dat"%;\
  /quote -wos /eval '"~/tf/data/fgear_os.dat"%;\
  /quote -wta /eval '"~/tf/data/fgear_ta.dat"

Can I replace this with a one-liner that will send the appropriate file to all
connected worlds?  Each world_name has a file with a corresponding name, as
illustrated above.  Is something like this even close?

/def fgear = \
  /quote -w${world_name} /eval '"~/tf/data/fgear_${world_name}.dat"

-Chad

I don't know if it's in place already, but could a feature be added to reverse the effects(affects?) 
of /require. 
 
I'ld like to be able to unload require items without having to shutdown tf.

OK, I have tried to write something to do this, and failed at each
attempt...some I'm gonna ask you guys.

What I have is I get a color from the MUD, the trigger for pulling
that color out of the line of text and putting it into a variable is
simple, and I have that down pat. There are only 8 possible colors,
and they go in a specific order: red orange yellow green blue indigo
violet white. If I get say, the color green to start, I want to issue
a specific command. After that command I'll get the same string as
before, but with a different color. If the color I get back is blue, I
issue CommandA, but if I got back yellow, I want to send CommandB. (If
the color is next one down on the list of colors, I want to send a
command to continue, if the color went back one, I have to issue a
command to reverse it).

Since that is all probably confusing, I'll give an example of text from the MUD:

A jet of green smoke shoots from the mouth of the demonic statue.

> pull arm 1

A jet of blue smoke shoots from the mouth of the demonic statue.

> pull arm 2

A jet of indigo smoke shoots from the mouth of the demonic statue.

> pull arm 3

A jet of blue smoke shoots from the mouth of the demonic statue.

> push arm 3%; pull arm 4


That should show pretty much what needs done. Thanks for help in advance!

This works for me in tf 4.0 stable.  Add an /elseif for each color.

; regexp matching
/def -F -t"^A jet of (.+) smoke shoots from the mouth of the demonic statue\.$"
-q detect_smoke =\
  /if ({P1} =~ "red") \
    pull arm 1 %;\
  /elseif ({P1} =~ "orange") \
    pull arm 2 %;\
  /elseif ({P1} =~ "yellow") \
    pull arm 3 %;\
  /elseif ({P1} =~ "green") \
    /eval push arm 3%;pull arm 4 %;\
  /endif %;\

&gt; OK, I have tried to write something to do this, and failed at each<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt; What I have is I get a color from the MUD, the trigger for pulling <BR=

&gt; that color out of the line of text and putting it into a variable is<B=

&gt; simple, and I have that down pat. There are only 8 possible colors,<BR=

&gt; and they go in a specific order: red orange yellow green blue indigo <=
BR>
&gt; violet white. If I get say, the color green to start, I want to issue<=
BR>
&gt; a specific command. After that command I'll get the same string as<BR>
&gt; before, but with a different color. If the color I get back is blue, I=
 <BR>
&gt; issue CommandA, but if I got back yellow, I want to send CommandB. (If=
<BR>
&gt; the color is next one down on the list of colors, I want to send a<BR>

&gt;<BR>

First off, this should be sending in plain text not
html, if it is html, I apologize.

OK, I'm trying to match figlet-like text output and
determine what the letters are, for example:

    \    __ )   ___| __ \ 
   _ \   __ \  |     |   |
  ___ \  |   | |     |   |
_/    _\____/ \____|____/ 

I would want ABCD stored into a variable.  The
output is in several fonts, and is not always 4
characters in length, and is random letters, although
always in upper case.  Any ideas on this would be
greatly appreciated.

I'm not sure how to do this, but I know the first step is
to write a series of patterns so that you can consistently
capture the words. You'll probably have to use a timer
to tell which matches all belong to one word.

For the next step, there's several approaches you can
take. One approach would be to convert the text into a
graphic, possibly connecting lines of letters if you
can manage that, then run the graphic through OCR software.

Another approach would be to analyze the text yourself.
See if you can consistently find patterns which distinguish
some letters from others, then combine all the distinctions
you've discovered to see if they uniquely identify enough
letters to determine the word.

All of this will be much easier if the mud uses only a
small set of words. Figlet, which you can learn more about
at http://www.figlet.org/ ,  has a limited number of fonts,
so in theory if you were crazy enough you could hard code
something to match any font it uses.


This is the sort of problem that I love, by the way. Some
people play MUDs to bash monsters. I play them to solve
tricky issues like this. :-)

I'll let you know if I have any success at matching figlet's
output.

Good luck, and good hunting!

Has anyone addressed this in tf as yet?

I'm thinking of sorting a alphanumeric list in either ascending or 
descending order and the result being the sorted list at the end.

Given how useful this could be, any chance we would see it in a future 
release?

Thanks in advance

Strange, mine is adding nearly an hour and a half.

Ultimately, what are you trying to do with the time?

Dear TF List,

I use TF to connect to a few MUDs. Recently, one has made some changes to
allow the useage of extended ASCII codes, like solid blocks or upside-down
question marks. This doesn't display so well in TF. On Windows systems the
general solution is to use a different client that uses the Terminal font,
but I'm running TF from a Linux box console, no GUI involved.

Does anybody have any suggestions on how to get TF to display these
characters? Is there a font I could use, or perhaps a modification of TF
itself? I appreciate any help that is offered.

Rick

Hi!

Here's a sorting routine copied from somewhere, some earlier post in this 
list I think. Anyways, sorry I can't give credits to the author, but 
hopefully this helps you.

Try:
/setenv LC_CTYPE=en_US
If it works toss it in  your .tfrc

Of course, that will only help if the MUDs happen to be using ISO-8859-*1*=
=20
(a.k.a. ISO-Latin-1, the ISO-8859 charset for en_US and most other 'Western=
=20
European' languages), rather than, say, CP-1252, or worse, Windows-1252. I'=
m=20
hazarding a guess (having mucked in the internals of a few MU* servers) tha=
t=20
they're probably not sending UTF-8, unfortunately (or maybe fortunately,=20
given it's TF and TF hasn't even the beginnings of UTF-8 support, yet, last=
 I=20
looked).

If the problem is that your terminal doesn't support any non-ASCII characte=
rs=20
at all, then set LC_CTYPE=3DC (explicitly, "just in case", though a blank v=
alue=20
is supposed to default to this anyway) which should, at least in theory,=20
cause TF to consider any characters with the high bit set to be 'unprintabl=
e'=20
(what happens then depends on your %emulation setting, of course, and TF is=
=20
only as good as your C library, mostly, when deciding "non-printable").

Of course, unless your system is exceedingly starved for memory and disk,=20
you'll probably have a more pleasant experience if you fire up a basic X=20
server and one of the various X-based terminal applications. If you configu=
re=20
it for truly minimal, and don't fire up any "suite" applications (KDE, Gnom=
e,=20
etc.), it can still fit into an impressively small memory footprint, and th=
e=20
only terminals I know of that most people might *ever* see that it can't do=
=20
some sort of display on are (A) true VT-100/102/220 units, or (B) teletypes.

If you've really found a (graphical) exception, throw it down as a challeng=
e=20
to the geeks, and *someone* will probably take you up on it. Especially if=
=20
you offer them development hardware. :)

I'm running version 4.0 and I have /visual on. I'm currently toying with
modifications to the spellcheck routine and I want to get it to
highlight misspelled words in my input field. Does anyone know if
there's a way to get colored text in the input field with /visual on? So
far I've had no luck. If I toss the parsed string at /grab, it prints
out the color codes. If I embed a /echo in the /grab, it just strips the
color codes (or at least doesn't display them). 

My apologies for the code (no comments or anything and still has a
plenty of work remaining), but here's what I have so far. I echo the
color coded string normally just to make sure colors are working and
that I've got the right words highlighted and then I try replacing the
current contents of the input field with this string.

Any suggestions on how to see the pretty colors (short of mind-altering
drugs, mind you)?

Thanks,
Walter

OK, so this one has been bugging me for ages; without a \n, tf just
won't show the stinking line.  I've looked at the code once or twice,
and it seems a significant undertaking to "fix" that.  So, today I
finally got annoyed enough to try pulling it off with some hooks.

I ended up with:
------------
/def -h"PROMPT" grab_prompt = /eval /prompt_show %*
/def prompt_show = \
    /let tmp=$[decode_ansi({*})] %; \
    /echo -p %{tmp}
------------
which seems to work right.

(Just in case anybody else has been as irritated as I, and hasn't
gotten around to making their own workaround yet)

Yes, but that's not what I want.  I want it to just show partial
lines, just like it shows completed lines.  No special prompt
fiddling, no holding a partial line in abeyance forever until another
line comes in, just show the lines.  Thus, that hook.

I've used TF for years, always telnetting to a UNIX box to use it. My issue now is that I'd like to be able to get notification of activity from Windows, through the Windows flashing activity notification in the taskbar. Is this possible at all?
If I can't get Windows to notify me that TF has detected activity I'll have to switch to a windows-native program like SimpleMU, but I'd prefer TF.  Any thoughts at all?

Why not Use TF on Windows and then use a trigger to say, run a  
javascript that displays an alert (popup) window, with the  
notification ?

That's not a bad idea, but I'd prefer something more subtle. The flashing in 
the taskbar is perfect for my purposes, as it's likely to happen a lot, and 
a popup would become obtrusive. This has to be work-safe, too, for me.

Tried setting CTYPE to en_US, got an error stating it was an invalid locale
for LC_CTYPE. Must be the server, as I did the same on another and it
worked. After doing that, TinyFugue is now displaying some of the extended
characters, just not -all- of them.

As for firing up X, not really an option as I'm just using putty to SSH into
a shell I've been provided.

Any other suggestions?

Of course, that will only help if the MUDs happen to be using ISO-8859-*1*
(a.k.a. ISO-Latin-1, the ISO-8859 charset for en_US and most other 'Western
European' languages), rather than, say, CP-1252, or worse, Windows-1252. I'm
hazarding a guess (having mucked in the internals of a few MU* servers) that
they're probably not sending UTF-8, unfortunately (or maybe fortunately,
given it's TF and TF hasn't even the beginnings of UTF-8 support, yet, last
I looked).

If the problem is that your terminal doesn't support any non-ASCII
characters at all, then set LC_CTYPE=C (explicitly, "just in case", though a
blank value is supposed to default to this anyway) which should, at least in
theory, cause TF to consider any characters with the high bit set to be
'unprintable' 
(what happens then depends on your %emulation setting, of course, and TF is
only as good as your C library, mostly, when deciding "non-printable").

Of course, unless your system is exceedingly starved for memory and disk,
you'll probably have a more pleasant experience if you fire up a basic X
server and one of the various X-based terminal applications. If you
configure it for truly minimal, and don't fire up any "suite" applications
(KDE, Gnome, etc.), it can still fit into an impressively small memory
footprint, and the only terminals I know of that most people might *ever*
see that it can't do some sort of display on are (A) true VT-100/102/220
units, or (B) teletypes.

If you've really found a (graphical) exception, throw it down as a challenge
to the geeks, and *someone* will probably take you up on it. Especially if
you offer them development hardware. :)

IT's feasabile to modify TF for Windows to do the flashing titlebar  
(it's simple API Call, SetFocus() will do it, as will SetWindowPos(),  
or you can even use the FlashWindow() API call, I don't know if  
FlashWindow() is implementing in the Cygwin Windows.h file though).

You'll need to install Cygwin, with Dev tools (not installed by  
default), and then download and build tf in the Cygwin Bash shell,  
adding you modification.  I would probably add a command handler and  
an associated / command so that you can add it to your scripts and  
triggers to ran at your need, and not use a global hook.  The code is  
straightforward.

Hello,
   I'd like to grab a multi-line list of output from the mud, the list
looks something like this:

The satchel contains the following items (8): Item, Item2, Item3, Item4,
 Item5, Item6, Item7, Item8.

This could go on for several lines but the last item always ends with
a period.  Any ideas are very welcome!

I would question whether the list really is a multi-line or whether it's 
been broken up by the mud into separate lines.

Try setting your columns on your mud to a huge number like 10000. If the 
output looks something like this:

The satchel contains the following items: itemone, itemtwo, itemthree
    itemfour, itemfive, itemsix, itemseven, itemeight, itemnine, itemten,
    itemeleven.

then chances are it's all one line and you can easily work with it. You can 
fix the screwy output (like that above with /set wrapspace 1. Unfortunately 
you just have to put the command to make your column width bigger as part of 
your login

Propably the best way is to make 2 triggers, one that concatenates the 
lines to one, and the second one matching that line.

So...

;; Replace multiline text with one line for further matching
/def -p3 -mregexp -t'^The satchel contains the following items .*[^.]$' \
   satchel_multiline = \
   /set satchel_line=%* %;\
   /def -p2 -mglob -t'*' satchel_middleline = \
     /set satchel_line=%%{satchel_line} %%* %;\
   /def -F -p3 -n1 -mregexp -t'[.]$' satchel_endline = \
     /substitute %%satchel_line %%* %%;\
     /undef satchel_middleline %%;\
     /unset satchel_line

/def -p1 -mregexp -t'^The satchel contains the following items (.*)[.]$' \
   satchel_match = \
   /echo insides: %P1


Notice, that the satchel_endline needs to be fallthrough (-F), and it 
needs to have bigger priority than the actual matching trigger.

Special characters, or at least the degree symbol, are not displaying 
properly in 5.0 beta 7. The degree symbol is shown as a zero. Does 
anyone know what I would need to change in order to correct this? My 
limited knowledge makes it too hard for me to even find the error.

Little bit more info would be helpful.
Such as OS being used?
And what font do you have set in your... term window?

I'm linux-based, so that's how I'm approaching this.

If you are using linux, then you will have to check to make sure that
the font that you are using in your term window actually contains the
characters that you are wanting for it to display.  (The how-to on that
would depend entirely upon which term program you are using.  :) )

In windows, well, the same concerns could apply if you are using a
fontset that does not have all the symbols.  Though the specifics for
TF in windows, I have no experience with, but that's my guess. 

Also, the locale would be another thing to check, as that can affect
available characters as well.  (ie. a en_US locale would NOT contain an
umlaut while a de locale WOULD have such a character.)

Hello, is there a way to strip ansi codes as the text is being read into
TF?  I'm using tf5b7 and I get color-coded short score from the mud
depending on how many hps, sps, etc that I have remaining.  With tf4s1, my
status line kept the colors that I set, but with tf5, it grabs the color
that the mud sends.  Is there a setting in the trigger that I can set?

BTW, I have looked at /set emulation=ansi_strip, but that strips all ansi
codes and I dont want that, just to have them stripped before my status
line displays them.

Look into using the strip_attr() function in the trigger you're using
to store the userstat var.

Hair,

Does this help?

  strip_attr(s)
          (str) Returns <s> with all display attributes removed.

I had the same problem where I was automatically setting a target from text
with Ansi colors and it came up as that color in my status. I just pass the
text through that function before I update my status and it seems to work
pretty well.

Alex

Does anyone have some good code that will automatically log everything
in every world to
$home/logs/<worldname>/<worldname>-<mm>-<dd>-<yy>.log ? What I have
now (included below) works well, but if I do /dc in one world for a
different world, it kills the log of the world I am in, not the one I
am closing.

# For logging

/def LOGDIR = /home/users/mistwolf/logs

/def -Fp100 -h'connect' connect_log = /log -w
${LOGDIR}/${world_name}/${world_name}.$[ftime("%Y-%m-%d", time())].log
%; /eval /echo -ag -w${world_name}
%==========================================================================
%; /eval /echo -ag -w${world_name} %= Log for world *** ${world_name}
***, started $(/time %%c) %; /eval /echo -ag -w${world_name}
%==========================================================================

;Lets /dc function like 'QUIT' to trigger the disconnect (needed to
close the log)

; written by 'Brack <slayer at kaiwan dot com>'

/def -F -1ag -h'conflict' gagconflict

/def -Fiq dc = /if /@dc %*%; /then /trigger -hdisconnect %*%; /endif

;This lets you return to the special logging after shutting it off with /log off
;Note, if the original special log was during the previous calendar 'day', then,
;/relog will start a new log!

;

; Syntax: '/relog'

/def -i -q relog = /connect_log

;This is the disconnect function, noting the time the log ended and
closing the file.

/def -Fp100 -h'disconnect' disconnect_log = /eval /echo -ag
-w${world_name}
%==============================================================================
%; /eval /echo -ag -w${world_name} %= Log for world *** ${world_name}
***, ended $(/time %%c) %; /eval /echo -ag -w${world_name}
%==============================================================================
%; /log -w${world_name} off

I wouldn't call the code "good", but I did hack together something
for myself which uses a bash shell script and a tinyfugue script
to organize log files in a logs/YYYY/MM/DD/worldname-charname
format.

The code is partly based on relog.tf, and I use the shell script
to test for directories and create them if they don't already
exist. I'm attaching both files to this e-mail (I hope it gets
through).

This is how my logging code handles disconnect. It seems to work:

/def -ag -h'CONFLICT' silent
/def dc=\
        /if (!{#}) \
                /stop_log_hook $[fg_world()]%;\
        /elseif (tolower({1})=~"-all") \
                /quote -S /stop_log_hook `/listsockets -s%;\
        /else \
                /stop_log_hook %{1}%;\
        /endif%;\
        /@dc %{*}
/undef silent

Ouch. My brain broke.

Couldn't you just have your disconnect script accept a world name to disconnect from then it will disconnect that world, close that world's log and you're done.

Or hook in to the tf disconnecting functionality and when it sees the world is disconnected it turns off the logging facility by that world's name. Not sure how to go about that.

Yes.

/def -h"DISCONNECT" -p10 -F mydisconnect = /log -w%{1} OFF


I have no idea why anyone would want to make that more complicated.

Based on what I've seen here and talk with Ambrosia, this is my current 
setup on 4.0s1:

/def -Fp1 -ag -mglob -h'CONNECT *' = /histsize -w%1 10000 %; /log -w%1 logs/raw/$[ftime("%Y-%m-%d", time())]_%1.log %; /fg %1
/def -Fp1 -ag -mglob -h'DISCONNECT *' = /log -w%1 off
/def -Fiq dc = /if /@dc %*%; /then /log -w%* off%; /endif

Yes.

/def -h"DISCONNECT" -p10 -F mydisconnect = /log -w%{1} OFF


I have no idea why anyone would want to make that more complicated.

I play a diku MUD which allows one person run up to three characters.  The code
below is for my custom prompt, which takes the verbal hp and mv messages,
converts them to numbers, and places the hps and mvs for all three characters
together on one line along with some other info about protective spells that
are currently active.  As long as I always use the same three world_names (sy,
os, and ta) it works perfectly.  I would like to improve this /def so that it
allows me to swap any combination of characters in and out.

/def -p100 -F -h'PROMPT (<hp:([^ ]+) mv:([^ ]+)>)' peace_prompt = \
  /set var_hp_${world_name}=$(/hits_lookup %{P2}) %; \
  /set var_mv_${world_name}=$(/move_lookup %{P3}) %; \
  /set fighting=0 %; \
  /prmpt1 %; \
  /let lcl_prp=[%var_hp_sy/%var_mv_sy\ %var_hp_os/%var_mv_os\
%var_hp_ta/%var_mv_ta] %;\
  /eval /prompt %var_prompt1%lcl_prp${world_character} > %;\
  /clean_stuff

Since the variables are successfully being created for any world_name that
connects, I believe I can accomplish what I am trying to do by changing the
sixth line (/let lcl_prp=).  If I change the variables there from
%var_hp_sy/%var_mv_sy, %var_hp_os/%var_mv_os, etc. to something like
%var_hp_${prp1}/%var_mv_${prp1}, %var_hp_${prp2}/%var_mv_${prp2}, etc. I think
it will do what I'm looking for.  The problem is that I haven't been able to
figure out how to expand the variable from var_hp_prp1, to var_hp_sy, to the
actual value.  My plan is then to assign variables for each character that
connects: /set prp1=sy, /set prp2=os, /set prp3=ta, and then I could re-assign
the position of any character on connect, /load from their char files, or even
on the fly.  If someone can please help with this, I think I can make the rest
work.  I'm open to even better ideas though!  Here are some of the other /defs
that are called from above:

I currently have all aspects of a script working that tracks the number 
of certain spells memorized at any given time, assigns them to 
variables, and displays them on the status bar for multiple characters.  
Some but not all of the spells I am tracking are cure light, cure 
serious, and cure critic.  They all work great except for cure light, 
which appears on the first line of sample text below.  This first line 
also contains cure blind, which I don't want to display but the trigger 
hits it and not the cure light.

How can I fix this?

;;; Sample text from mud:
Spells memorized:
 1: ( 2) create food        ( 2) cure blind         ( 6) cure light         
 2: ( 7) cure serious       ( 1) corrupt            ( 1) meditate           
 3: ( 8) cure critic        


;;; Regexp under test:
/def -F -t"\((\ [0-9]?)\) cure ([a-z]+)" -q detect_mem_cure = \
  /echo P1=%{P1}, P2=%{P2}, P3=%{P3}, P4=%{P4}, P5=%{P5}, P6=%{P6}
  /if ({P2} =~ "light") \
    /set cure_light_${world_name} %P1 %;\
  /elseif ({P2} =~ "serious") \
    /set cure_serious_${world_name} %P1 %;\
  /elseif ({P2} =~ "critic") \
    /set cure_critic_${world_name} %P1 %;\
  /endif


;;; Results of execution:
 1: ( 2) create food        ( 2) cure blind         ( 6) cure light         
P1= 2, P2=blind, P3=, P4=, P5=, P6=

 2: ( 7) cure serious       ( 1) corrupt            ( 1) meditate           
P1= 7, P2=serious, P3=, P4=, P5=, P6=

 3: ( 8) cure critic        
P1= 8, P2=critic, P3=, P4=, P5=, P6=

Another problem is a single line might contain two of the cures variants
which you do want to match. I think the best way to handle this is to have
separate triggers for each:

/def -F -t'\( ?([0-9]+)\) cure light' -q detect_mem_cure_light = \
  /set cure_light_${world_name} %{P1}

/def -F -t'\( ?([0-9]+)\) cure serious' -q detect_mem_cure_serious = \
  /set cure_serious_${world_name} %{P1}

/def -F -t'\( ?([0-9]+)\) cure critic' -q detect_mem_cure_critic = \
  /set cure_critic_${world_name} %{P1}

I am trying to build a statistics counter in 4.0 stable to keep track of 
damage received in battle (will add damage dealt later).  I have 
everything working right now, except for when I am "barely hit".  The 
/def below places "Syphon barely" into %P1, "hits" into %P2, and "" into 
%P3, causing a "barely hits" to be counted as a "hits" as demonstrated 
by this mock battle.

------------------------------------------------------------

% Loading commands from statistics.tf.

Hello all!

I don't know where to start!  I would like to use TF to check all 
incoming text from the MUD and when it sees a line starting with the 
text "Advice: " (no quotes) or "[Newbie]" I want those lines to be 
written out to two separate files (or FIFO's..not sure which way I want 
to go yet)--one to collect advice messages and one to collect Newbie 
channel messages.

I am doing this because I would like to have separate windows displaying 
the advice and newbie messages and I intend to accomplish this by 
tailing the appropriate files/FIFO's in their own shell windows while TF 
is running in its own window.

Can someone give me an idea (example) how to write this script?  Also, 
is this an appropriate method to use to capture lines (channels, etc.) 
to their own windows or is there a better way to get TF to do so?

Thanks so much,
Kent!

This actually sounds like a perfect place to apply my "tabbed TF" stuff.
http://www.wacked.org:8888/~heller/tf_tabs/

It will let you write a trigger to capture those things and stick them in
different tf "tabs" that you can switch back and forth to just like you
might in a tabbed browser. So you could have tabs named "mud",
"mud:advice" and "mud:newbie" all right inside of your tf. 

Now, I'm pretty sure that the one listed above is for tf 5.0b6, but I
think I have a b7 version sitting around here somewhere.

This looks great.  Three questions I have, though:

1.  Where are the tab names defined?  Or (if I am reading the code 
correctly) the first time a sendtotab is used, the tab is created?

2.  Can you give me an example that I would use in my main script on how 
to properly create and send data to a tab for my "Advice:" example?  (I 
think this is just the sendtotab command...)

3.  The multi-line patch is for b6--will it work with b7?  Or do I need 
to just get a back copy of b6?

Kent!

Yea, they get set when you first sendtotab. All it does is create
an unconnected world.

this is slightly modified from one of mine: 
/def -ag -q -wworldname -mregexp -t'^Advice: ' advicetab=/sendtotab -aA $[strcat(world_info(),":Advice")] %*

And therein lies the issue with b7. It has its own multiline status bar,
but I haven't had the time to upgrade yet so I don't know the specifics of
it.

I've rebuilt b6 from patched source (256 color patch + mulitline status 
patch) and built a very simple .tfrc to load your tabs.tf and 
mystatus.tf then I have a the line to add the "Advice" tab.

When I have mystatus.tf loading, TF seg faults.  Without mystatus.tf 
loading, it doesn't.

I'm doing this on cygwin--maybe that's something.  There were some 
warnings during the compile, but no errors or termination and the app built.

Any ideas?

Kent!

Something further:

I've now rebuilt on a Fedora system with just the multiline status 
patch.  I have it all working! I've defined some tabs, etc. in my .tfrc 
and the tabs are being generated and pulling text into them properly.  Yay!

I am able to switch between the tabs using the /world tabname command.

BUT, there are three issues remaining:

1.  The alt-up/alt-down don't seem to work to switch between the tabs I 
have running.
2.  The MUD I play adds a carriage return at the end of each info 
message, so when I pull the Advice line into a separate tab, the main 
screen scrolls by 1 line.  Is it possible to have the Advice line PLUS 
the next (carriage return only line) get sucked into the tab?
3.  In you mystatus.tf file, I had to remark out the /status_add line 
referring to userstat.  This is the line that causes the segfault--and 
it does it in both the cygwin compile AND the Fedora build.  Any ideas 
what may be causing this?  Is there a variable I need to define 
somewhere that I've missed maybe?

Thanks again.  Great work with the tabs!

p.s.  If anyone can offer me the answer to my original question, I'm 
still interested in how to do that!

Kent!

If you could hunt down the exact code, that would be fantastic!

(And I'm actually playing Aardwolf!)

Thanks,

Is there a way to add timestamps to the output from a MUD/MOO in TF?  If 
not in the display, at least in the logging feature?

Here is what I have.  Its a trigger that looks for specific mud output
then writes a line to a log file.

/SET timefile=/path/to/tf-dir/times.txt

/DEF check_local_date = \
        /SET local_date=$(/sys date)

/DEF -F -t"Output from mud" write_time_file = \
        /check_local_date %; \
        /ECHO %local_date %| /writefile -a %timefile

Does this mean that it writes the timestamps to a separate file than the 
log?  Or as separate lines in the log file?  And is it only for specific 
output, or can it be for any output from the moo?

Sorry I haven't tested it myself yet.  I haven't had the chance.

Also, someone suggested a patch linked from:
http://ingwar.eu.org/tf/download.php

I had previously tried that, but the patch command just hangs 
indefinitely and doesn't do anything to the code.  Any ideas?


-David

This adds lines to a log file with the system date.  Here is an example of
what would be added to the log file:

!Wed Jul 12 08:33:34 EDT 2006


This particular script would just look for specific output from the mud.
I use it to see what time certian things happened.

After viewing andrew's example (to an earlier post of mine) I have tried 
to write some code to do the following:

1.  Look for lines coming from the MUD that start with the text 
"Advice:"   (no quotes)
2.  Take these lines, and these lines only, and redirect them to a log 
file instead of the main screen.

I know I'm probably doing something very wrong, or over simplifying 
this, but here is the code I've attempted to use:

; log channels to files
; ---------------------
/def -mregexp -F -p1 -t'^Advice:' advicelog = 
fwrite("/home/mydir/advicelog.log", %{*})


So I guess my questions are:

1.  Am I even close?
2.  Can I use the fwrite without an fopen() call first?
3.  How do I fix this mess and get the result I want with the 
simplest/fewest line(s) of code?  (read: Can someone actually give me 
the line or two I need, please?)

Thanks so much.  I'm very new at TF and find the documentation kind of 
sketchy.

Kent!

Hello

Here's a logging trigger that I use. It adds a timestamp the the line prior to writing to file.

/def -p1 -mregexp -t"^LOG\[(.*)\]: (.*)$" log_timestamper = \
        /let _type=%{P1}%;\
        /let _msg=$[replace('"', '\"', %{P2})]%; \
        /let _logtime=$[ftime("%y%m%d %H:%M:%S",time())]%;\
        /test fwrite("%{uzidirectory}/logs/syslog","[%{_logtime}] LOG[%{_type}]: %{_msg}")%;\
        /substitute -aCcyan -p [@{Cyellow}%{_logtime}@{Ccyan}] @{Cyellow}LOG[@{Cwhite}%{_type}@{Cyellow}]:@{Ccyan} %{_msg}

I guess I'm looking for a WAY simpler example...call me dumb today.

Can someone give me the example I'm looking for with far fewer 
variables?  I can make TF open the file and write text to it, but NOT 
the result of my original trigger regexp.

Thanks again.  Sorry for the trouble.

Kent!

Even better, here is my exact code (as it stands now after hours of 
messing with it) which does NOT seem to work.

Could someone please point out exactly where I am going wrong?  Thanks 
soooo much!

/def -mregexp -F -p1 -t"^Advice:.*$" advicelog = \
    /let advice_msg=$[replace('"', '\"', %{P0})]%; \
    /test fwrite("/home/Kent/advicelog.log", %{advice_msg})

Perhaps I'm missing some quotes, or have too many.  Perhaps I'm not 
using the regexp and ${P0} properly.  I just don't know.

btw:  When I put the %{advice_msg} in quotes in the fwrite line, I get 
the text "%{advice_msg}" (no quotes) being written to the file, so I 
know it's writing something.  It just seems like it isn't substituting 
the proper regexp result. 

Kent!

I got it!

The whole problem is that for some reason TF is not reading my 
multi-line macros correctly.

When I put the entire macro on one line, it works fine.  Multiple-lines 
it doesn't.  I suspect this is because I'm running it on Cygwin (UNIX 
like environment for Windows) and not a POSIX system.  That said, I'm 
going to try this on my Linux box ASAP!

Thanks so much for all your help, everyone!
Kent!

I'm playing Aardwolf, using TF, and have been wanting to have TF log me 
in automatically.

What's strange, though, is that when I connect to the MUD I never 
actually see the text telling me to type in my username/password ("What 
be thy name, adventurer?" and "Password:").  Knowing that I must login 
once I connect, I just type in the username and password.

This leaves me with a problem:  there is nothing to trigger my 
auto-login macro from.

Does anyone know why TF isn't showing me that prompt?  Is there a way to 
turn that off so that the prompt comes through?  Perhaps there is a 
default gag in a TF library somewhere?

Thanks,
Kent!

I have a separate file containing tf commands for each character, which is
loaded during connection and contains a /load autologin.tf as the first line. 
Within autologin.tf, you can have something similar to the following:

/def -n1 -mregexp -F -h'PROMPT (^What be thy name, adventurer)' name_prompt = \
  /eval ${world_character}

/def -n1 -mregexp -F -h'PROMPT (^Password)' password_prompt = \
  /eval ${world_password}

Is it possible to make the input area (below status line) in visual mode 
larger?  I would like 5 lines instead of 3.

I can't find any reference to how this would be done in the online manual.

Thanks,
Kent!

I'm trying to install and run tf through cygwin to solve a connection problem I was
having. I actually don't have much hope of it fixing that problem, but I've put a
lot of effort into getting it to even compile. I'd like to at least finish the job
by running it and trying it out.

It seems to have compiled okay now, but when I try to run it, I get these error
messages:

% Loading commands from /cygdrive/c/tf/tf-40s1-lib/stdlib.tf.
% /cygdrive/c/tf/tf-40s1-lib/stdlib.tf, line 32: warning: whitespace following

Can't read required library.

---

Can anyone help me out? Google wasn't helpful at all. I don't know what 'whitespace'
it means. If I open the file, there's no blank spaces there. Though there are
carriage returns of some sort.

Thanks in advance for any help.

I've had similar problems.

The issue is that the file being read is saved in PC format and not UNIX 
format, so the newline characters at the end of each line aren't being 
read correctly by TF.

For the files (that I created myself) where this was an issue, I opened 
them up in a program called TextPad (free trial download) and then 
re-saved them in UNIX format (an option when you do a Save As).

Hope that helps.  This mailing list has been super helpful for, me so I 
hope this is giving something back that works!

Kent!

I have a couple more questions for you super TF geniuses out there!

1.  I have this gag macro:

/def -mregexp -ag -t"^You are hungry.$"

Which gags the text fine, but my screen still scrolls by 1 line after 
the gag.  Is there a way to gag the newline that follows this text as 
well?  I'm new to regexp and can't find a way to include it in the 
expression.

2.  I've managed to get TF to catch my prompt using prompt() and it 
displays great in the input window.  But whenever text comes in from the 
MUD simply explaining something (like "Bob drops his sword.") going on 
around me, my prompt disappears out of the input window and doesn't come 
back until I press <Enter> or issue another command.  Is there some way 
to have the prompt NOT disappear from the input line when the MUD is 
giving me information?

Thanks so much for everything everyone!
Kent!

Not sure on this one, but I would like the answer as well if anyone else has it.
 Are you also using /visual on?  I only have this problem when receiving large
chunks of info from the MUD, like when I'm following someone and they run very
fast.  The prompt disappears until they stop.

Or if you like blank lines generally, but just not this one, then

/def -mregexp -ag -t"^You are hungry.$" i_am_hungry = /def -ag -n1 -t""

The thing is, I don't want to gag all blank lines--just the one 
following the lines "You are hungry." and "You are thirsty."

All other blanks I want to keep.

In zMUD for windows, the trigger would be a multi-part trigger and have 
a second gag that only executes when the initial trigger is, well, 
triggered.  Can that be done here?

Any ideas?

Sure, please see Matthew Ender's email for an explanation of doing this using a

This doesn't happen with all routers, so I'm pretty sure it's at least partially the
router's fault.

If I'm running the Windows version of TinyFugue (40a4), either from a DOS window or
Cygwin, I have to keep a /repeat going every 5 minutes to ping all the worlds. This
isn't a problem. The problem comes when I leave the window for a few minutes to do
anything else. The connections die.

Oddly this does not happen if I leave TF up in the foreground and the screen saver
kicks in. It'll happily sit all night without losing connection.

Presumably there's some idle timeout somewhere the router is doing. Is there a way
to get TF to keep doing stuff, even when it's in a background window? Even trying to
get the MUSH to send info to me every few minutes doesn't really seem to work.

IF all of that is beyond people to try to help me with, maybe someone can answer
this simple question for me.

What kind of connection does TF open? Is it TCP, UDP, something else? Is there a
port other than the MUSH ports?

Thanks for any help. This has been driving me crazy for a long time.

-J

I'm not quite sure how to pull this off, a bit more complex than usual for me.

I recieve a few lines of text from the MUD, as follows:

In Avalon, it is the 11th day of Midwinter, 1169 years since the Divine War.
Lore-riffic Sierra was born on this day, 51 years ago.
Rambler Vegan, Forest Rover was born on this day, 239 years ago.
Lupus was born on this day, 235 years ago.
Filanna was born on this day, 177 years ago.
Mordeth was born on this day, 266 years ago.
Dark Druidess Astlebe, The Mercurial was born on this day, 101 years ago.
Mageling Goldheart of Mercinae was born on this day, 166 years ago.
Ellemorgaine of Mercinae was born on this day, 109 years ago.

What I want to do is take that list, and write it into a file a little
differently:

Lore-riffic Sierra was born on this day, in the year 1118
Rambler Vegan, Forest Rover was born on this day, in the year 930
Lupus was born on this day, in the year 934
(etc, etc)

What I want to do is simple enough: take the "51 years ago." part of
the string, subtract that number 51 from the current year given in the
first line (1169 in this case) and put the answer back into the string
with slightly different text.

I'm pretty sure it can be done...but no idea how to do it!

Thanks a lot in advance!

Go grab the sources in tar.gz format from the website, then use  
Cygwin's Bash shell to unzip the files, ( use: tar xzf  
tf-5.0b1.tar.gz for example) you should be able so just go into the  
source folder, and ./configure  then wait, then make, wait, make  
install, wait :-).  At that point you can run the thing.  If you  
want, the precompiled windows binary is still available for 40s1, I  
haven't updated it to 5, though that's on my list.  If I think about  
it, I'll update that this weekend.

I had problems with running make from the main source directory (after 
running ./configure of course).  It wouldn't make into the subdirectories.

I just cd'd into the src directory, then ran make and make install from 
there.

Sounds like you have the wrong Make in the path.  Use export PATH=/ 
usr/bin:$PATH first to make sure that the Cygwin make is the one it's  
using, sometimes other compilers will put the wrong Make out there  
(the .NET framework SDK does it, as does Visual Sstudio and Borland's  
Delphi / C++ builder.

I tried setting that environment variable as you suggested just now, and 
still no go if I try to make from the main tf-50b7 (sources) directory.  
Here is the error I get in Cygwin when I try the make:

$ make
/bin/sh: Files/ATI: No such file or directory
make: *** [files] Error 127

Though, as I said, if I cd into the tf-50b7/src directory and run make 
then make install, everything works great.

Kent!

Trig to capture the variables. I'm using set for brevity...
/set year 1169
/set sierra_age 51
/eval /set sierra_born=$[year-sierra_age]
/listvar sierra_born
  (tf outputs /set sierra_born=1118)

or, to better get what you're looking for...
/eval /echo Lore-riffic Sierra was born on this day, in the year
	$[year-sierra_age]

Of course on a single line.

Is it possible to get the PROMPT hook to pickup a multi-line prompt?

Say my prompt looked like this:

[(Reply: Jason)  Dbl: 35  15qst]
[  245/325hp 123/321mn  233/500mv  867g] >

Would it be possible to have the hook move the entire prompt into the 
input window?

Thanks,
Kent!

I'm playing Aardwolf and can't figure out how to enter two or more 
commands on a single line at the command prompt from TinyFugue.  In zMUD 
(client) I used the ; character to separate commands, I believe, but 
that doesn't work in TF.

Can someone tell me what character to use, please?

Note:  This is in interactive mode, not in a macro.  I know how to use 
%; in a macro.

Thanks,
Kent!

I'm not sure how to move them both into the input window, but you might 
be able to use two separate triggers.  1) Captures the first line and 
places it on the status bar; 2) Captures your prompt and places it in 
the input window.

Use %; to separate the commands.

Hi Kent,
There are two ways to do this. If you only want to do it 
occasionally, you can use /eval before pasting/typing the commands 
like Chad said. If you want tinyfugue to always listen to the %;, 
then you can change the /sub setting. There are 3 values for 
substitution parsing, "help sub" will give you details.

Normal behavior us /sub off. That is, %; is only parsed in macros and /evals.

/sub on will have %; parsed in interactive commands

/sub full will do all substitution in interactive commands that is 
possible in macros.

If you'll notice, when someone asks for a speedwalk, invariably 
someone will try to paste their zmud alias into their gossip, but 
only the very first part will be gossipped. They have to either turn 
off parsing or escape the ;s in order to gossip an entire speedwalk. 
This is one of the reasons that I like to keep sub off, and just use 
/eval when I need to.

Hope this helps,
Mike/Abe

Tinyfugue is a telnet client. Telnet is connection-oriented TCP.

When you say you have a repeat to ping the worlds, do you mean the 
actual ping command, or do you mean sending some command to the MUSH?

If you mean an actual ping, then that wouldn't help keep the MUSH 
connection opened, because the ping is new traffic, and isn't sent 
across the same connection (and ping is ICMP, not TCP or UDP). 
Similarly, if you had 2 characters on the same MUSH, each of those has 
a totally-separate connection, where what happens on one will have no 
impact on the other.

The router knows and understands about the different connections to a 
given world. Because the router is doing NAT, it needs to keep track of 
them, and it is the router's job to open and close those NAT 
connections when appropriate.

You mentioned that having the MUSH send you output was not sufficient. 
This is probably because the routers that don't work are designed to 
only care about traffic that you generate, where it relates to 
keepalive. You should try having your /repeat send something to the 
world, rather than calling the ping function.

Hope this helps,
Mike

Quoting "Michael G. Schabert" <mikeride@localnet.com>:

> Trig to capture the variables. I'm using set for brevity...

Here's a more complete version. I'm guessing that this is a 
once-per-connection thing. The below just catenates an additional line 
each time it sees an age listed. You'll probably want to clear out the 
file when you connect, to initialize the list. Blank lines separate 
"real" lines. Anything without a blank line should be all on a single 
line.


/def -mregexp -F -t"In Avalon, it is the [A-Z a-z0-9]+, ([0-9]+) years 
since the Divine War." set_year = /eval /set year=%P1

/set agefile avalonages.txt

/def -mregexp -F -t"was born on this day, ([0-9]+) years ago." add_name = \
        /Make_line %P1 %PL %; \
        /test fwrite(agefile, {temp_text}) %; \
        /eval /echo %PL

/def Make_line = /eval /set temp_text %{-1} was born on this day, in 
the year $[year-{1}].

Hope this helps,
Mike

Has anyone had any luck with this in the past?  I was really hoping to 
get it to map, but I can't seem to--no matter what keymappings I use.

Thanks,
Kent!

I can't remember where I saw it, but there was a list of the numpad
characters.
Here's what I have, and for it to work, numlock needs to be OFF.

/def -b'^[[D' = esq w    4
/def -b'^[[C' = esq e     6
/def -b'^[[A' = esq n     8
/def -b'^[[B' = esq s     2
/def -b'^[[5~' = esq ne    9
/def -b'^[[4~' = esq sw    1
/def -b'^[[G' = esq look    5
/def -b'^[[1~' = esq nw     7
/def -b'^[[6~' = esq se      3
/def -b'^[[3~' = /dopath sk   .
/def -b'^[[2~' = esq enter    0

I added the numbers behind, just to show what they are. I don't know what
the other characters are. I found this somewhere with google.

I would like to remap a function key on my keyboard to send text to the 
MUD but NOT the final carriage return as I want it to wait on the 
command line for me to finish typing the line.

That is, I want it to send this:

cast spell on _

where the _ is my cursor waiting for me to finish typing.

Is this possible?

Thanks,
Kent!

very much so:
/def key_f4 = /input cast spell on

should do that for you.

Below are some other ideas for you to chew on.  With this setup, if you just
type 'fb' by itself tf will send the command 'cast fireball'.  However, you can
also specify a target with something like 'fb demon'.  You could use this as it
stands, or along with a %target variable or the /input function described
below.  The alias 'ccs' by itself will cast cure-serious at the %tank variable,
but 'ccs damocles' will instead cast cure-serious at damocles.

/alias fb \
  /fireball %{*}

/def fireball = \
  /if ({*} =~ "") cast fireball %;\
  /else cast fireball %{*} %;\
  /endif

/alias ccs \
  cast cure-ser %{1-%tank}

I'm really having trouble pulling data out of my prompt.  I just don't 
understand regex well enough (and I've been reading and trying, believe 
me!). 

Here is my prompt:

[282/282hp 319/319mn 385/540mv 833tnl 1963g] >

What I want to do is set variables for each of the data values available 
in the prompt (only the first number in the case where there is num/num).

I've done this, which is quite obviously wrong:

/def -mregexp -h"PROMPT ^\[([^ ]*)/[^ ]*hp [^ ]*)/[^ ]*mn [^ ]*)/[^ ]*mv 
([^ ]*)tnl ([^ ]*)g\].*>$" catch_prompt = \
        /set hp=%P1%; \
       /set mn = %P2%; \
       /set mv = %P3%; \
       /set tnl = %P4%; \
       /set gold = %P5%; \
       /prompt({*})


My ultimate goal is that I also want to catch the hp and mn and mv 
values when my prompt looks like this:

<123hp 456mn 127mv Enemy: 19%>

But in this case, I want to check when the value of the hp variable (we 
are setting) is < 25 and execute a command a single time (when my hp < 
25 in battle I want to run away!).

Is this all possible?


Thanks so much.  Without this list, I don't know what I would have done!
Kent!

Well, I've tried this version (and it looks smarter than mine since you 
are using the \d+ for numbers!--see, I'm learning this regexp stuff) but 
it isn't working for some reason.  I startup the MUD, let a few prompts 
go by, then type:

/listvar hp

and I get nothing.  So I try /listvaring the other variables and nothing 
on them, either.

But I'm pretty sure my prompt hooking is working OK. I've got hooking 
turned on and my world type is diku (in the /addworld line) and my 
prompts are appearing in the input window as one would expect.

I'm thinking the hook isn't working.  Any ideas?

Also, any suggestions on doing the one-shot macro ("flee" command to the 
MUD) when my hp goes < 25 during combat?

Thanks again,
Kent!

Upon further testing, if I do this:

/trigger -hPROMPT [282/282hp 319/319mn 385/540mv 833tnl 1963g] >

The hook executes and the variables are set.  Which tells me that if TF 
would only trigger the macro when it sees a prompt come in, everything 
will work fine.

It's just not executing when the MUD sends the prompt.  But, as I said 
below, my prompt is showing up in the input window (because lp=on and if 
I set lp=off it does not show in the input window anymore) so I would 
think that TF is recognizing it as a prompt, just fine.

I'm so confused.

Kent!

I use something similar to keep info on my status bar.  This works fine on
an LPMUD (Batmud as it happens to be).  My prompt is like this:

H:820/820 S:39/39 E:340/340 C:489 X:309 >

And what I use to grab the information is this (The first 2 lines listed
here are really one line in my editor):

/DEF -mregexp -h"PROMPT H:([0-9]*)/([0-9]*) S:([0-9]*)/([0-9]*) E:([0-9]*)
/([0-9]*) C:([0-9]*) X:([0-9]*) >" prompt_hook = /test prompt({*}) %;\
        /SET hp=%P1%; /SET hpmax=%P2%; /SET sp=%P3%; /SET spmax=%P4%;\
        /SET ep=%P5%; /SET epmax=%P6%; /SET cash=%P7%; /SET exp=%P8

I also grab my short score information to update my status line during
combat, regen, etc, here is the trigger for it (again, first 2 lines are
really 1):

/DEF -F -t"H: * (*) \[*\] S: * (*) \[*\] E: * (*) \[*\] C: * \[*\] X: * \[*\]"
get_sc_data = \
        /SET oldhp=%{hp}%; /SET hp=%{2}%; /SET hpmax=$[substr({3},1,-1)]%; \
        /SET sp=%{6}%; /SET spmax=$[substr({7},1,-1)]%; \
        /SET ep=%{10}%; /SET epmax=$[substr({11},1,-1)]%; \
        /SET cash=%{14}%; /SET exp=%{17} %; \
        /check_eps

Instead of calling the check_eps macro that I wrote to check my endurance,
you could have one to check your hp and then flee:

/DEF check_hps = \
	/IF (hp < 25) /SEND flee


The above setup works well for me and keeps my status bar updated.

Here's how i would capture that line.
/def -mregexp -t'\[([0-9]+)\/([0-9]+)hp ([0-9]+)\/([0-9]+)mn
([0-9]+)\/([0-9]+)mv' hp_bar = \
     /set hp %p1%;\
     /set maxhp %p2%;\
     /set mana %p3%;\
     /set maxmana %p4%;\
     /set move %p5%;\
     /set maxmove %p6%;\
          /if ({hp} < 15) flee%;/endif

that would capture your current/max hp, mana, and movement. I don't have a
hook in there, since i don't use one, but it sounds like you have that
working fine.

Hmm.  When I do it like so, provided the prompt is detected by TF and 
placed in the input window properly, this trigger never occurs.  BUT, if 
the MUD scrolls and the prompt is pulled back out of the input window 
into the output window as sometimes happens (any time the MUD sends new 
info to the output window) THEN this trigger occurs.

But when I make this a hook (use -h instead of -t) it does nothing.

So this tells me a couple of things:

1.  TF is detecting the prompt as an lp/diku prompt and placing it in 
the input window for that reason.
2.  For some reason even though TF detects the prompt as a prompt, the 
PROMPT _hook_ isn't happening.
3.  Both /d+ and [0-9]+ work in the regexp which appears is not the 
problem anymore.

So the question now is:  why won't TF execute the hook when it moves the 
prompt into the input window?

OK - I've got something working now!  I think I know where the problem 
is but I'm not sure how to fix it.

When my prompt has no color coding in it, my regexp matches perfectly, 
the hook executes, and the variables are set.  BUT, when I change my 
prompt to include some color coding the hook no longer works.  I was 
testing on a colorized prompt the whole time!  I had no idea that the 
colors mattered to the regexp.

So here is my hook/regexp that works provided the prompt has no colors 
in it:

/def -mregexp -h"PROMPT ^\[(\d+)/\d+hp (\d+)/\d+mn (\d+)/\d+mv (\d+)tnl 
(\d+)g\].*>" catch_prompt = \

Again, here is the prompt:

[282/282hp 319/319mn 385/540mv 833tnl 1963g] >

Now, to make the example simple, let's say my MUD is colorizing the 
initial [ and the last ] to bright white and the final > to bright 
yellow.  My regexp now no longer works!  (In actuality it's colorizing 
almost every aspect of the prompt.)

So I think what I should do is this:

1.  Have the MUD send the prompt uncolored.
2.  Get the hook matching the uncolored prompt and pull the data out--I 
know I can do this now thanks to all the code suggestions you've all posted.
3.  Somehow re-colorize the output of the prompt string before executing 
the /test prompt({the_prompt}) command.  I think I would have to pull 
all the numbers out of the prompt, then using strcat piece the prompt 
back together in the {the_prompt}variable with TF color codes embedded 
in the string, which should be easy, but I can't figure out how to get 
the TF color codes into the variable.

Am I close?  Is it even possible to have both a colorized prompt and 
somehow pull the data out of it?

(Sorry for all the questions, but it seems every time I figure something 
out, something new pops up.)

Thanks,
Kent!

Hello,

I'm a new user of TF and I've learned a lot about this MUD client already, but I have a little question, which goes: is it posible to /hilite only one single world or phrase, but not an entire line?

Thanks,
Gohatsu

PS. Oh, I almost forget, question number two: is there an alternative way to do coloured /hilites instead of:

/hilite *orb* = /set hiliteattr=green

?

I haven't used functions much, but maybe you could use strip_attr() to strip the
color codes so your hook will work?

Well, each of these works when the other is commented out:

/def -mregexp -F -p10 -h"PROMPT ^\[(\d+)/\d+hp (\d+)/\d+mn (\d+)/\d+mv 
(\d+)tnl(\d+)g\].*>" catch_prompt = \
       /set hp=%P1%; \
       /set mn=%P2%; \
       /set mv=%P3%; \
       /set tnl=%P4%; \
       /set gold=%P5

/def -mregexp -p1 -h"PROMPT ^\[.*>" show_prompt = \
       /set the_prompt=%P0%; \
       /test prompt({the_prompt})

But when both are loaded, only the first one (that sets the variables) 
works. 

And so far, I'm still testing with an uncolored prompt (until I get the 
priorities right, then I'll adjust the second code to colorize the prompt.)

Have I missed something?

And I wanted to piece them together into stringC="some string and his 
friend", I would do this, right?

stringC=$[strcat(stringA, " ", stringB)


Now what if I wanted stringA to be colorized green and stringB to be 
colorized yellow for display on-screen?  How do I get those color codes 
into the strings?

Do I somehow need to use the substitute command?  Or is there some what 
to give attributes to strings not covered in the attributes section of 
the help?

Thanks again,
Kent!

the easiest way to do that would be
/eval /echo -p @{Cred}%stringA @{Cblue}stringB

though you could do some string re-parsing to do it on a single
string, though you'll just be extracting the two strings again. though
if you're wanting to have a string that holds multiple colors, well,
i'm not sure how to do that.

I'm using tf for some telnet chatting and wonder if someone could give
me some sample code for this? The entries looks like this :

TheName says: Hey you!
TheName2 says: Waaz up?

Now I want a list of users in a file (a friends list) that gets
different colors. So for example TheName is red and TheName2 i blue but
I want it in a separat file so I easily can remove/add new users...

Any hints?

Regards,

juman

Hi,

I'm not sure it'll work, but try this:

/def -T -PCred -t"TheName" TheName
/def -T -PCblue -t"TheName2" TheName2

-P is a paritial hillite, you can put many attributes here (font color, backgroud color, underline, etc., read help), uses regexp

-t defines trigger, "TheName" activates it (this is regexp, required by -P, global is not allowed here)

whole definition is ended by it's name (label your definitions, it's a good habbit).

You can put it in a file (friends.tf, contacts.tf, etc.), and add this line to your tfrc file:

/load frientd.tf

It should work.

Gohatsu

Here is something similar to what I am currently doing this in 4.0 stable.  It
works well for coloring groups of names into different colors.  I have the
following in a file named color.tf:

/set COLOR_BLUE=(Name1|Name2|Name3)
/set COLOR_RED =(Name4|Name5|Name6)

/eval /def -F -aBCblue -t"%COLOR_BLUE" -q color_names_blue
/eval /def -F -aBCred  -t"%COLOR_RED"  -q color_names_red

Easiest solution to maintain:

=====
/def create_friend_trig = \
	/eval /def -F -aBC%2 -t"%1 *" %1_color_trig


/quote -S -dexec /create_friend_trig '"friend.tf"
=====

Then have a text file "friend.tf" with entries like:
john	blue
mary	red
mike	green

etc.

You'll easily be able to glance at that file and tell what your trigs 
should be doing.

Could also try this:

  /def -i high1 = /def -p5 -Fq -PBC%{2-red} -t'%{1}' tHi1_%{1}
  /def -i high2 = /def -p5 -Fq -PBC%{2-blue} -t'%{1}' tHi2_%{1}

Use like:

 > /high1 TheName  [orange]
 > /high2 TheName2 [magenta]

The colours in [ ] are optional.
To get rid of a name, just undef it.

 > /undef tHi1_TheName
 > /undef tHi2_TheName2

And:

 > /save friend1.tf tHi1_*
 > /save friend2.tf tHi2_*

Can autoload the files at startup and make a hook to
autosave at quit time.

This is nice... and works fine :-) but it matches the "name" everywhere
which is bas if the name is "says". Can I make it match just if the
specified word is the first word in a line?

Hi all,

is there any way to /trigger a string that starts with a dash ? Such as
/trigger --- ? (I have a code that needs to trigger content of a
variable and that content sometimes starts with a few dashes.)

Thanks, Petr

Of course it is possible, just start a name with "^" (matching the null string at the beginning of the input string). For more info read regexp paragraph in http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/tf-40s1-help/topics/patterns.html.

Hi Doug,

thanks for the tip ! This is not exactly what I had in mind, however. My
problem is that I need to internally trigger a string using the /trigger
command, but the string itself begins with a dash. The /trigger command
thinks the string contains an option and complains that it is invalid ...

To see what I mean, try:

/set foo=---
/eval /trigger %{foo}

Thanks, Petr

Content-Type: text/plain;

A recent OS change and accompanying tf version change seems to have altered
the behavior of /quote.  In particular:

 

Previously, while using 5.0 (an earlier beta version that I can't recall), I
could execute the command:

 

/quote '"thisfile.txt"

 

While not connected to any sockets.  If the file contained lines which were
valid tf commands, they were executed.

 

In 5.0 beta 7, this behavior appears to have changed.  Executing the above
command gives me a "% Not connected" error message.  I have to explicitly
tell /quote to execute the lines as commands by using:

 

/quote -dexec '"thisfile.txt"

 

While I can create workarounds for this change, I'm curious if it is
intended that way.  It seems to me that a valid tf command ought to, by
default, be executed; especially in the case where tf is not connected to a
world so only tf commands would be valid anyway.

 

Was this change intentional?  Is there any chance of the default behavior I
suggested in the previous paragraph being restored?

I have a simple thing that looks like this :

/def -F -t'board:*' mytest = /echo FOUND:%{PL}

But it only echoes :

FOUND:

and not what it matches as I thought %{PL} would provide. What am I
doing wrong?

CHeers,

juman

Hi Juman,

> I have a simple thing that looks like this :
> /def -F -t'board:*' mytest = /echo FOUND:%{PL}
> But it only echoes :
> FOUND:
> and not what it matches as I thought %{PL} would provide.

Probably two issues together.

First, %P is defined only after regexp matches, your def looks like a
glob match. You have to use -mregexp in the def command.

Second, do you really want to display what is before the "board:" text ?
You use %PL, but perhaps you really wanted to display what is after the
"board:" text ?

If I guessed right, what you want is:

/def -F -mregexp -t'^board:' mytest = /echo FOUND:%{PR}

And you can test it with:

/trigger board:something

Hope this helps, Petr

I use tf to connect to a telnetserver that sends a commandprompt that
looks like this :

But it doesn't end with a newline so I have some troubles gagging it so
I do'nt have to see it. Any tips on how to do that?

Cheers,

juman

Maybe this would help with commandprompt, I'm not sure:

/def -ag -mregexp -t"^>" gagprompt

I've been using TF5b7 for a while now, and decided to clean up and add
stuff to my status line.  I currently use the /SET status_fields method,
but the documentation and the program say they prefer you to use the
/STATUS_ADD /STATUS_EDIT and /STATUS_RM to modify the status field.  I
noticed that TF is supposed to be able to have multi-line status bar, so
I decided to experiment with it, but I can't get it to work.  Here is what
I have done:

/STATUS_ADD -B -r0 :1 "H":2 hp:4:BCblue

This line works fine.  I get a space, H then my hit points in blue

/STATUS_ADD -B -r1 :1 "S":2 sp:4:BCcyan

This line however, does not work.  I dont get a 2nd line added to my
status bar or anything, and when I do:

/STATUS_RM sp

TF informs me that there is no such field called sp.

Has anybody gotten multi-line status line to work, and if so how? :)

Thanks

It's been a while since I've played with the status lines, but, I
believe that there was a variable that you need to set to have the
extra status lines show up.
I've had up to 3 with various info before.
Can't remember off the top of my head, and don't have the time to look
it up right now.
Since I'm not at my computer, I can't simply look in my ~/.tfrc file.  

Hope that points you in a better direction.

According to "/help status line", you probably need "/set status_height=2".

Thanks for the info, works like a charm now  :)  Neither my /help status
line or the status line help page at tf.tcp.com has any mention of the
status_height variable.  Anyway, thanks again

The Web site is for version 5.0p5, and %status_height was added quite
late, so that makes sense.  But it should be in your local help--I
think you may have an old version of the help installed with a 5.0p7
binary.

What would be the correct way to color a certain pattern with 
both foreground and background colors defined with rgb256 colors?

Example:

/def -Fp9 -P1BCrgb242 -mregexp -t'((\[|\{|\(|<)(fall)\+(>|\)|\}|\]):)' fall_lite

I'd like to add highlited background there too.

I'm not sure about the 256 color palette, but this works fine for the
standard 16 color palette.  I'd imagine the format of the commands is
similar though.  Here is a partial hilite with foreground and background:

/DEF -F -p9 -P0Cbgmagenta,Cblack -t"[[{<(]party[]}>)]" party_lite =

This does magenta background and black foreground, and the only part of
the line that is hilited is the enclosing brackets and the word party.
The brackets can be matched sets of any of the following:
[] {} <> or ()

--Hair

Combining /unlimit and morescroll() in a keybinding confuses tinyfugue,
and morescroll() fails to work.

I was attempting to bind ^xx to:

  /unlimit %; /test $[morescroll(moresize()-moresize("n"))]

And in the process found that morescroll() gets confused and fails to
work when coming out of a limit when one is not in a /more *before* the
limit.

To duplicate this oddness: (I use PennMUSH, but you can replace the
'think' and pattern with whatever you choose)

  /bind ^xx=/unlimit %; /test $[morescroll(10000)]
  /more on
  think <Foo> Bar
  think edit(lnum(100),%b,%r) <- Create lots of spam to scroll <Foo> up
  (esc-j or otherwise scroll to bottom)
  /limit <Foo> *
  (^xx)

Ideally, this should end up with the viewport at the bottom. However, it
does exactly the same as if you'd just typed "/unlimit" - morescroll()
is failing.

More investigation:

* Manually typing /unlimit then /test $[morescroll(10000)] works fine.

* If you press ^xx again, it properly scrolls to the bottom.

* If you're paged up or have unseen input *before* you enter /limit,
  then it works correctly.

* If you're not paged up, you enter /limit, and generate new text, then
  hit ^xx, morescroll() still fails.

* If you add a /echo between /unlimit and /test $[morescroll()], then it
  works as expected, but you get an unsightly echo at the end of your output.

* moresize() and moresize("n") both return the expected, good values
  when they're placed in the binding for ^xx.

* My current workaround is to use "/limit -mregexp .?", then tack on
  /unlimit to the end of the binding. A bit messy, but it works.

System this was on:

TF version: tf5.0b7
OS: Linux 2.6.16-gentoo-r12. Gentoo distro.

Also a confirmed issue on a slackware and debian.

Final workaround:

/bind ^xx=\
  /limit -mregexp .?%; \
  /test $[morescroll(moresize()-moresize("n")+(winlines()*(1-moresize("n"))))] %; \
  /unlimit

Hi everyone,

This patch makes the alert stream configurable like the other status 
fields. You will be able to control the position and width of the field.

Let me know what you think

Greetings,

Hi everyone,

This patch adds the timestamp prefixing to the logfiles. By default the 
logging prefix is of the format %H%M%S but can be configured by the 
log_prefix internal variable.

Let me know what you think.

Greetings,

Mark Pustjens

Hello! :-)

I've noticed that my tf50b7 starts to act really funny after it's
received a lot of text from the mud. I normally notice this after
partying for 45min-1hr. It starts to gag most things that were once a
normal trigger and the said trigger stops working. I for example have
a trigger that goes off when a monster dies; that line that was used
is gone and none of my looting triggers work.

I used to think it was because I had my scroll back set at 20,000
lines, but now I have it set at 5,000 and I know that is not the
problem as I can scroll up all the way to the top and see that it's
almost always full.... I generally have about 5 processes always
running used for saving my settings and have a couple of streams open
for logging (messages and the general mud output).

I would like to think that this is not my fault, but it's possible
that it is. I've tried using my triggers on a few different machines
too by the way. I have an AMD64 running Ubuntu at home, some Redhat
ES3 x86 machine on my Web server and another x86 machine running
Slackware.

Any information about this would be great! Thanks ;-)

Alex

I suppose that you could always wipe out and reload those triggers and
hooks.

My 2 cents,
Knute

Is scrolling supposed to work in non visual mode? Works perfectly in visual mode, but would like to use non visual mode since being able to see 5 or 6 past prompts is very important. Using 5.0 beta 7. thanks

Hello, I have a question about input logging.
Everything works fine, I use /log -i command, log file looks like:

[17:03:03:473171] # Przechodzenie przez zamkniete wrota nie nalezy chyba 
do najlepszych pomyslow.
[17:03:05:112556] # zadzwon
[17:03:05:137200] # Pociagasz za sznurek przymocowany do malego dzwonka.
[17:03:05:137205] # Z gory dobiega cie zmeczony glos: Znowu?
[17:03:05:748704] # kto
[17:03:05:776565] # Sposrod 122 osob przebywajacych obecnie w swiecie 
Arkadii, znane tobie to:

Input command were: 'zadzwon' and 'kto'.

My question is if input command in log file could be followed by some 
char, for example: >, or =>, to look like:

[17:03:03:473171] # Przechodzenie przez zamkniete wrota nie nalezy chyba 
do najlepszych pomyslow.
[17:03:05:112556] # => zadzwon
[17:03:05:137200] # Pociagasz za sznurek przymocowany do malego dzwonka.
[17:03:05:137205] # Z gory dobiega cie zmeczony glos: Znowu?
[17:03:05:748704] # => kto
[17:03:05:776565] # Sposrod 122 osob przebywajacych obecnie w swiecie 
Arkadii, znane tobie to:


Any ideas?

Greetings,

Rind

I am a TF and Unix/Linux n00b so please excuse me if any of these questions
are inappropriate for this list. My current setup is as follows:

 

TF Version - 5.0 beta 7

O/S - Windows XP Pro

 

I have been spending about 2 weeks messing with TF, Cygwin and different
types of terminals in order to educate myself and achieve my desired results
as follows:

 

1.	TF in 256 colors (i.e. /load testcolor.tf works)
2.	TF running in a windows as opposed to full screen
3.	TF running with the lowest amount of overhead possible
4.	Cut and paste (ctrl+c and ctrl+v) working
5.	Standard keys working (page up, page down, fkeys, etc)

 

I have had some success getting most of the above results using all
different kinds of settings and terminal combinations. It seems that what I
would like most would be to run TF in a Windows XP command windows (cmd.exe)
while still getting all of the results above. Even though everything I've
read seems to indicate that cmd.exe supports 32bit color (you actually have
to reduce the color to 256 using the compatibility tab on the shortcut to
cmd.exe) but no amount of tweaking seems to get the /load testcolor.tf to
show anything more than the standard colors (8 or something).

 

Now for my questions:

 

-          Does anyone know a way to get tf to run in an XP command window
with 256 colors?

-          Does tf launch some default terminal (xterm, etc) via the
cygwin1.dll or cygz.dll so it's basically killing the windows cmd.exe
terminal and launching one via cygwin?

-          If this is what's happening ( or something like it) can I compile
tf to automatically launch rxvt instead of xterm as it's 'shell'?

-          Am I missing something obvious in my current state of
cluelessness?

 

Additional info that may be relevant:

 

-          I've compiled the 5.0 beta 7 using the lastest copy of Cygwin

-          I'm a .net programmer so I do have some experience with tech
stuff just clueless about unix and terminal

-          I can run rxvt with or without X and get the colors I want (it
seems)

-          I'm not afraid of difficult procedures or recompiles so fire away
even if it's hard

 

Thank you to anyone who waded through this long n00b post.

 

Peace,

 

Locker

I don't really know how to properly reply to a message that was posted
before I joined the list so if this is wrong, clue me.

qubax asked the following question:

"Is there a way to include the prompt in the log?

Thanks for your help."

I have a solution that isn't specifically designed for that use but does
cause the prompt info to show up in the log file when using /log -g. I play
on a heavily modified circle mud and had to do some work on the prompt to
get it working to my liking using Visual Mode (ON).

I wrote a prompt hook that echos the info back into the history so I can see
my health going down etc in my fight logs. Here is an example:

/def -h"PROMPT * > " prompt_hook = \
	/set strPrompt=$[decode_ansi({*})]%; \
	/test prompt(strPrompt)%; \
	/set strMini=$[substr({strPrompt}, 2, strlen({strPrompt})-4)] %; \
	/eval /echo -w %{strMini}

Now you'd probably want to take out the '/test prompt(strPrompt)%' line if
you don't want to actually change the prompt but it should give you a good
place to start.

Peace,

Locker

You can't without heavy modification of tf,  In order to accomplish  =

this, you have to change the windows console modes.  In the old  =

Windows 9x MS-DOS emulation, you could use the console command to get  =

Blink and 256 color support.  With the advent of Windows NT, 2000 and  =

XP,   To make matters worse, Vista's Monad shell appears to make  =

things even more complex.

No, it uses whatever the current shell is, be it cmd.exe, bash, sh,  =

ksh or tcsh depending upon how you have it configured.

No, but you can create a shell script that accomplishes what you  =

want, I personally used Cmd.exe when I still used Windows, but that  =

was 5 years ago.  These days I use Windows for in a VM for  =

development (I write Windows code for a living) and some code  =

testing, but for everything else, I'm a Mac guy.  The headaches of  =

dealing with Windows on a day to day basis was costing me too much  =

time and money.

> cluelessness?
Not really, Cygwin is an amazing, but nasty piece of work to make  =

Windows behave like a Unix.  The only real reason that TF requires  =

Cygwin at all is that it depends upon functionality of the select()  =

command to work the same against File descriptors as it does against  =

network socket I/O descriptors.  Windows doesn't to that, and Cygwin  =

implements a grisly hack to implement a Select() that behaves like it  =

does on every Unix out there.  Everything else that TF does could be  =

done in a Windows compatable way, with that little exception.  I've  =

done the work to patch TinyFugue to not use this assumption back in  =

the 4.0 days.  It was a ton of changes and impossible (for me at the  =

time, as my Unix BSD Socket-foo simply didn't exist) to keep the  =

changes isolated and platform generic.

You *might* be able to abuse the .NET console API's to switch the  =

console to 256 color mode, and then spawn the TF process within the  =

shell by intentionally forcing the .NET console app to exit unclean.

Yes, a shell script that calls rxvt with a script to set the  =

environment and launch TF and then saved to the desktop would give  =

you a clickable application.  I used a variant of this methodology to  =

build the clickable shortcuts I used in the druware.com tf  =

installation, which ultimately just called tf -n, and set the  =

TFLIBDIR and HOME directories using Windows API calls to get the  =

launched path of the exe plus /tf-lib and the MyDocuments folder to  =

the HOME folder.

It's hard.  You'll have to apply the 256 color patches to TF, then  =

you'll also have to find someplace to shoehorn the Windows Console  =

API calls into place, possibly even altering the IO code to deal with  =

the color set calls,

IIRC, the API for the Mouse Cut/Copy/Paste stuff is SetConsoleMode(),

On the other hand, IIRC, you have to remap the screen IO to use  =

WriteConsole because the default CMD.exe process doesn't support the  =

the ANSI codes to get 256 colors.

Astounding insight from nadaca420-reg@yahoo.com (on Wed, Oct 25, 2006 at 09:47:17AM -0700):

tinyfugue runs separately from the mud. It doesn't wait until "look
north" finishes, it just sends "Look n" and continues.

My suggestion is to use some kind of mud-side 'echo'. On PennMUSH, this
could be 'think'

Am I also correct in guessing your /1 is /send?

/def LOOK       =/1 think ...NORTH...%;/1 l n%;/1 think ...SOUTH...%;/1 l s%; \
                 /1 think ...EAST... %;/1 l e%;/1 think ...WEST... %;/1 l w

Trying to get TF to synchronize its output with your mush without some
form of trigger (such as '</RDesc>' for mxp or some such) is approaching
futility.

Hope that helps?

Don't know if this'll help, but I ran into the same problem and solved it 
the lazy way.  I wrote a personal command on the server called 'echo' that 
simply echoes text back.

If you have coding access enough to do that, it solves the problem nicely.

I am trying to write a simple macro to perform a "look around". Here is the
current macro definition:

 

/def LOOK       =/ECHO ...NORTH...%;/1 l n%;/ECHO ...SOUTH...%;/1 l s%;/ECHO
...EAST...%;/1 l e%;/ECHO ...WEST...%;/1 l w

 

My problem is that all the echoed text comes out first followed by the look
results as follows:

 

...NORTH...

...SOUTH...

...EAST...

...WEST...

(Room 1 Details)

(Room 2 Details)

(Room 3 Details)

(Room 4 Details)

 

The results I'm looking for would be like this:

 

...NORTH...

(Room 1 Details)

...SOUTH...

(Room 2 Details)

...EAST...

(Room 3 Details)

...WEST...

(Room 4 Details)

 

I'm having a problem figuring out how to produce this result. Couldn't find
a 'pause' or 'wait for previous command' function and was hoping for some
insight.

 

Thanks much,

 

Locker

A fellow mudder (Cindy of BurningMUD) wrote a script that does this.

It's pretty simple and attached.

Thank you for all the suggestions as they gave me some ideas. Here is what I
ended up going with, sloppy as it may be:

 

/def lo = \

            /send l n%; \

            /echo ...NORTH...%; \

            /repeat -1.20 1 ${le}

            

/def le = \

            /send l e%; \

            /echo ...EAST...%; \

            /repeat -1.20 1 ${ls}

            

/def ls = \

            /send l s%; \

            /echo ...SOUTH...%; \

            /repeat -1.20 1 ${lw}

            

/def lw = \

            /send l w%; \

            /echo ...WEST...

 

So when I type /lo in tinyfugue I get the behavior for which I was looking.
Once again thank you all for helping me work out this issue.

 

Peace,

Subject: [TF] Command evaluation in a macro body

 

I am trying to write a simple macro to perform a "look around". Here is the
current macro definition:

 

/def LOOK       =/ECHO ...NORTH...%;/1 l n%;/ECHO ...SOUTH...%;/1 l s%;/ECHO
...EAST...%;/1 l e%;/ECHO ...WEST...%;/1 l w

 

My problem is that all the echoed text comes out first followed by the look
results as follows:

 

...NORTH...

...SOUTH...

...EAST...

...WEST...

(Room 1 Details)

(Room 2 Details)

(Room 3 Details)

(Room 4 Details)

 

The results I'm looking for would be like this:

 

...NORTH...

(Room 1 Details)

...SOUTH...

(Room 2 Details)

...EAST...

(Room 3 Details)

...WEST...

(Room 4 Details)

 

I'm having a problem figuring out how to produce this result. Couldn't find
a 'pause' or 'wait for previous command' function and was hoping for some
insight.

 

Thanks much,

 

Locker

hi,
it's still me, asking more questions.

firstly, i thank for the previous answers, now i'm writing more and
more complex macros and triggers and everything works fine!

i have now two new problems; i have tried to solve them by myself but
without success.

1) i log always everything; i'm now partecipating to a long quest,
which requires to send logs of some actions. so i made a macro

/def startquestlog = /log -g quest.log

which works, but i cannot understand how to do the stopquestlog macro: i tried

/def stopquestlog = /log off quest.log

but this starts logging on a new file, called "off quest.log"...

2) i'd like to make a trigger for telling a random string from a set
of strings when something happens; how can i define a list of strings,
and how can i choose a random one?
is it possible?
i'd prefer not to use an external command to do this, if possible.

thanks

Hmm ... I can't really test this, but maybe a list of macros like:

; This can be made into a trigger, to call one of the others at random
when it trips
/def actrandom = /text$[rand(1,4)]

; These define the action for the above to take
; for any given number in the range it has, and
; can do anything you like (and changing "(1,4)"
; above, you can change how many there are.

/def text1 = emote taps his foot lightly
/def text2 = emote whistles quietly, passing the time
/def text3 = say So, anything interesting going on, anyone?
/def text4 = emote looks around, bored

Hello, I did a quick scan thru the archives on tcp.com, but didnt see any
subjects dealing with this.  Is there a patch or anything to allow MXP
support in TF?  Thanks

--Hair

PS how about search ability for archives, subject,author, etc

This really wouldn't be possible. Tinyfugue is a shell program...it 
doesn't have any windows or fonts of its own to control. On un*x 
systems, there isn't a standard way to arbitrarily change fonts in a 
text console. Indeed, on some un*x systems, changing console font 
would require recompiling the kernel. The windows version is 
basically running in a pretend un*x console.

While it runs fine within Xterm and variants, tf is not an Xwindow 
app, so graphical elements beyond ANSI aren't really feasible.

Oh, there is always a way :-).  You can even do alot of it without  
resorting to patching TF itself.

Looking at the various options, you can use TF's functions to remap  
all the tags to Console friendly elements, though why you'd want to,  
I don't know.

Some of the things aren't going to happen in the TF window, but you  
can certainly use TF's excellent /sh or /sys support to have your MUD  
session open the various tags like images, and files, and even the  
'relocate' method could be handled by TF to change worlds to the new  
location.  I just don't get the point.  It's a MUD, and all that  
stuff is GUI fluff.

Well, this is a mud with a (brand new) absolutely huge overworld that
connects the areas.  I was asked by a friend on said mud if I knew if TF
support MXP or not, and I replied that I'd ask the list  :)  Personally, I
ssh into a unix box and just play there, thru Putty.
