Hiya,

I've noticed that some of my aliases take quite a while to be sent
to the mud I frequent, achaea.

What it turns out to be is TCP ACK and line buffering - I have an alias
which does something like this:

/alias ml mind deadening $[target] %; mind lock $[target]

The trouble is this: TF is sending both lines to the socket but because
it seems to do it in two seperate writes, one for each line, the second
line is only sent /after/ the TCP ACK is received from Achaea from the
first line.

The round trip time is quite noticeable out here in Australia.
The delay before the second line is actually quite noticeable and
in combat seems to cause quite the trouble. :-)

I've fudged it by doing this:

/alias mm /send mind deadening $[target]\012\010mind lock $[target]

Which does indeed send two lines in one write. 

Am I able to do this without replacing all of the multi-line output
aliases/commands with /send ? Do I have any control over the buffering
and flushing of data sent to a world?

Thanks!




Adrian

Not only that, the typical machine you run on will have an MTU set for 
1500 by default. Even if your client sends both first and second part 
very quickly, the kernel may not send it till after an extra delay 
trying to build up a 1500 byte line (among all net apps). Check out 
setting your MTU to something less efficient, but more responsive, e.g., 
a power of 2 + 40 bytes, like 296 (256 + 40).

You already embed a newline (really you should just use char(13) for 
telnet), then tell TF to send by pre-building your 2 commands into a 
single string. After that it is up to the system kernel. If you use 
linux or a *NIX, you are in luck because you can adjust that. If you run 
windows you are probably out of luck.

Oh, thats easy to beat - I can just disable nagle. You're describe the
Nagle algorithm for combining bits of small packet data into a larger
packet before sending. I /want/ this to happen!

I can control it by only sending a big write() to the kernel whether
its windows or unix. the TCP/IP stack and the Mud cares not whether
a single TCP packet has one, two or three lines in it.

If Tinyfugue can buffer its output until I say "yup, now is a good
time to send everything to the socket" then I'll be happy camper.
If not, its time to fake up something which abuses /send :-)

Disabling the Nagle algorithm when connected to a network which you are 
not controlling is at best impolite, and at worst a sabotage. Since MUD 
traffic is usually not voluminous, it is quite possible that you can get 
away with it, though.

No, I'm not suggesting disabling nagle. I'm suggesting tuning the 
packets to match network conditions for interactive applications and 
degraded networks, rather than tuning for bulk sizes for web browsing 
and file downloading on high speed LANs. You've described (a) a need to 
combine smaller packets so they all get there near the same time (you're 
tuning from the client side), and (b) choosing an MTU that won't 
fragment on the way. As you get longer routes and less reliability, 
routers will start fragmenting, which defeats a larger MTU anyway. Add 
to this that heavy traffic policies on those routers are to drop traffic 
they can't fit neatly into their buffers (intentional drop of traffic 
beyond capabilities on a packet-by-packet basis), and you'll find that 
smaller packets more often fit into those overstressed buffers without 
being dropped (thus reducing total traffic in TCP because of no need to 
resend). In any case, I doubt you'd have any luck disabling Nagle 
without root control at both ends, you might find it isn't always 
honored, while adjusting the MTU does NOT harm Nagle in any way, it 
simply deals better with bad network routes to have a smaller MTU. Try 
it, set MTU for 296 (256+40) or 552 (512+40) and see if it is more 
responsive (just to be clear, smaller MTUs are less efficient only 
during good network conditions, and actually becomes more efficient as 
conditions degrade).

No, you can cause fragmentation and drop of packets that way. If you 
fill a buffer you don't necessarily control how it is filled, and you 
risk either fragmentation (requiring multiple packets and reassembly) or 
outright drop of the data.

I created a macro that is like the dopath macro, but is just /dp, and it 
automatically combines everything into a single command before sending. 
The earlier sample was a hard coded version, what I do is something like:
/dp 5 e "open east" e "close west" 3 "climb down"
(which creates each command separated by char(13), then sends it all in 
the same string).

This is what I need to do, I need to echo a variable

Could look something like this:

/set ally bob
/echo %{bob}
#and it could echo
bob
#yet it echo's
%{bob}

It could be so easy, yet I've been digging through the tf-lib, and I saw 
nothing simple like this..
they nested it somehow in a macro... and that spinned my mind off in

	Two things; first the name of the variable is ally and the value
"bob", and second echo just echos, you'll need something like this.

/set ally=bob
/eval /echo %{ally}
or
/def allytest = /send say this %{ally} guy is really great!

Hope that helps a bit.

Not to bring up a repeat topic, but I haven't seen a definitive answer in 
the archives. I've been using tintin++ for a few years, and have become 
very accustomed to full ansi logging (among other features). I've seen 
that setting the emulation to raw you can log ansi but it breaks a lot of 
other things. Prompts don't always seem to be logged either (which is 
crucial for logging PvP fights). Is there a "right" way to do this yet 
that doesn't break anything else?

On that note how can I guarantee that prompts will appear in the output 
window properly?

Also, one feature I added to tintin was a command cache. Originally it 
started as just a speedwalk cache, but I extended it to include arbitrary 
commands to work with special paths. Essentially it's just a link list of 
commands to send at a specified delay. It looks like I should be able to 
use a combination of string functions and /repeat to duplicate this, but 
I'm curious if there might be a more efficient way.

Thanks!

Hello,

I don't know about Ansi Logging, but I do a lot of scripted actions.

Most of my scripted actions have a command loop that does the repeating and
a collection of steps that are sent to the mud. Something along the lines
of:

/def takeStep \
=   /if (stepping == 1) \
        /let stepMacro /step$[currentStep] \
%;      /set currentStep $[currentStep+1] \
%;      /eval %stepMacro \
%;      /repeat -1 1 /takeStep \
%;  /endif

/def startStepping \
=    /set stepping 1 \
%;   /set currentStep 100 \
%;   /takeStep

/def step101=go wea
/def step102=e
/def step103=e
/def step104=w
/def step105=n
/def step106=n
/def step107=w
/def step108=w
/def step109=w%;/set stepping 0

With some imagination, /if statements and creative /set currentStep's you
can create quite complex behaviour this way. (Enough not to get caught for
botting yet, anway. :-)

Regards,

Peter.

Well those are some very simple tools I have written in base of a
recent post from Peter M. Lemmen and done some work around with perl
with some scripts that help you do reverse paths and
take from a less annoying format to the tf script  format

By example:

fo-ma: n-s-s-up-swim w-n-up


Will be "translated" to:

/def step_fo-ma_1 = n
/def step_fo-ma_2 = s
/def step_fo-ma_3 = s
/def step_fo-ma_4 = up
/def step_fo-ma_5 = swim w
/def step_fo-ma_6 = n
/def step_fo-ma_7 = up

You can have as many single-line paths as you want

The name-steps separator is tied to :

~                         Optional, default is dash(-)
$translate  [separator-for-steps] < infile > outfile

Also leave the file formated to  the "reverse_path" so he  can do the
revesal path job.

$ reverse_path [from_path]  [to_path] < outfile > final

This one should be called for each reversal job, a wrapper around
those could be convenient.

The file: speedwalk should be loaded in tf.

Then you load the paths files in tf so in tf you just call:

/startStepping fo-ma

And it will just start stepping it¡s way along.
If the automation fails you can alwais use:

/stopStepping

The oposing directions pairs are driven by a file so you can add as
much as you need.
So for the modifiers for the same directions so the reverse path get
and idea on how
to deal with those.

For now it's quite primitive but functional.

Also I have written it mostly on spanish messages and
documentation.(Sorry)

I do Achaea so it's tuned for it, but I think it can be used by anyone
since no MUD-Specific string attached to it.

Hope someone find those usefull.

I currently have a trigger that works, but would like to add another check to
make sure that my tank variable is set to Syphon.  How would I do that?  Would
this work?

/def -wta -F -t"^Syphon's skin loses its stony hue." -q detect_sy_lose_stone = \
  /if (fighting)\
  /if ({tank} =~ "syphon")\
    /eval /set stoneskin_ta $[+stoneskin_ta - 1] %;\
    /send -wta cast stoneskin syphon %;\
  /endif

Thanks.

-Chad

Hello,

You probably want to use logical operators to combine multiple expressions,
like so:

/def autoCastEngineCombatStart \
=   /if ( (autoCastVarEnabled == 1) & (stateVarFighting == 1) ) \
        /set autoCastVarCurrentSpell 100 \
%;      /autoCastEngineCast \
%;  /endif

Regards,

Peter.

I just migrated from 4 to 5b6, and I'm having some problem updating my
function keys. Previously, I'd used

/def -p10 -B'F3' = /foo bar

but that's been deprecated.  It's my understanding that the new format
should be:

/def key_f3 = /foo bar

This doesn't work for me.  When using the newer definitions, pressing
any of the function f2-f9 prints the code ([0Q, [[19~, etc) but doesn't
execute any function.  Pressing F10 gives "key_f10: no such command or
macro."  If I define:

/def key_f10 = /foo bar

It works fine.  Same for F11 & F12.  The lower keys work with the
deprecated-style -B defintion, with the warning.  Any idea why the new
way doesn't work?

Thanks
Bean

Is it possible to configure the scrollback in TinyFugue 5 to work in a
split-screen mode, where part of the screen is the scrollback and part
of the screen shows the current output?

If not, what do others on this list think of such a feature?

Greetings, I'm running TinyFudge 5.0  Beta 6. On Mac OS X, Darwin with 
the bash shell.

I want to bind my number keypad numbers to a diffrent macro than the 
numbers at the top of my keyboard. I've tried to find ways to do this 
before and can't figure out how. If anyone has any ideas or answers I'd 
appreciate it. Thanks.

I really like the idea.

Some other mud clients I've used had this feature, very handy.  On the
same note, I've always thought it would be great to support
split-windows in general.  It'd be neat to have an extra window
outputting different variables and things regarding a characters
status, or to redirect certain chat channels to.  Things of that
nature.

I have no clue how difficult this would be to implement into tf
however.  Any thoughts?

Ben

is there a way to have the last inputted line stay on the command line so
you can just hit <return> to repeat commands?

Are you aware that standard key bindings already let you do that with just <Ctrl-P> <Return>?

Using the emacs-like keybinding David mentioned is probably a much
better approach.  I too once asked around about getting the previous
input to remain in the input-line, but after some thought I determined
it would be more of a pain than it's worth.

If you're running around attacking NPCs or something, yes it would be
very convenient.  However, if you had just input a message to another
player, that message will remain in your input-line and you'll have to
backspace your way back through it.  At least in my terminal there was
no easy way of deleting the whole line (as in zmud when the line is
already highlighted and if you type anything it gets replaced).

The function to delete an entire input line is /dokey dline.
By default the keybinding for this is Ctrl-U (as is common in Unix).

Hello,

You can also simply bind a key you don't use much to do recallb and newline,
like so:
/bind \\=/dokey recallb%;/dokey newline

In this case, this binds the backslash key, which I have no other use for
during mudding and is conveniantly placed next to the enter key on my
keyboard.

Regards,

Peter.

This is unix we are on, there are several ways to do what you want without
modifying TF.

The most common would be to create a named pipe (man mknod) and then have
something display the output of that pipe (tail -f pipename or cat <
pipeneme).

>From TF, you open the pipe for writing (/help tfopen) and then in your

(/help tfwrite)

I used this for a bot that watched a donations room. He would record the
people entering the room and the items they donated or took. When I was
on-line, I would 'tail -f logfile' in a separate window and watch what was
going on while doing something else with my main character. Of course, I used
a real file to keep the output in, but a named pipe is like a file, except the
output is not kept.

Ok I'm having trouble with this prompt grab I'm using.  Not sure what
the best way of solving it is.  Here's what I'm using.

/def -mglob -h'PROMPT {}' nullphook = /set prompt=
/def -mregexp -h'PROMPT ^H:([^ ]*) M:([^ ]*) E:([^ ]*) W:([^ ]*) B:([^
]*) \\[([^\\]]*)\\]$' prompthook = \
  /set health=%P1%; \
  /set mana=%P2%; \
  /set endurance=%P3%; \
  /set will=%P4%; \
  /set blood=%P5%; \
  /if (strchr({P6},'e') < 0) /set equilibrium=0%;/endif%; \
  /if (strchr({P6},'b') < 0) /set balance=0%;/endif%; \
  /if (strchr({P6},"p") < 0) /set prone=0%;/endif%; \
  /test prompt({*})%;\
  /if ((logfile !~ '') & (nlog() > 0)) /test fwrite(logfile,{*})%;/endif%;\
  /set secondline=0%;\
  /processstatus%;\
/heal 

In P6 there are not one, but two b's that could pop up at any given
time, thus eliminating the purpose of the if statement I'm using in
this case.  Anyway, I'll put an example prompt at the bottom, any help
would be appreciated.

H:2094 M:1570 E:9370 W:8901 B:100% [csdb eb]
That's the prompt in action.

As I see your regexp, you are going to have a % symbol in your 'blood'
variable. This will cause you problems later on if you try to do some math
with the result.

As for the balance/prone display, you havn't given enough information to offer
a solution. Is the string always in []? Is the string a fixed length? Is the
string separated by a space as shown? These are just some things we would need
to know to help you. Others may have played on the game you are on and know
the answers, but some of us are seeing your prompt for the first time.

I don't play the same mud you do, but our prompts are somewhat
similar.  I figured my prompt code might help you out or give you some
ideas.  (This code works on Lusternia, an IRE game)

sample prompt:
9999h, 9999m, 9999e, 9999p, 9999en, 9999w elrx-

;;;; prompt trigger
;;;; note: the {P1}+0, {P2}+0, etc is used to strip the color from the strings

/def -mregexp -n0 -q -h"PROMPT (\d+)h, (\d+)m, (\d+)e, (\d+)p,
(\d+)en, (\d+)w (.*)\-" prompt_catch = \
    /eval /set health	    $[{P1}+0] %; \
    /eval /set mana	    $[{P2}+0] %; \
    /eval /set ego	    $[{P3}+0] %; \
    /eval /set power	    $[{P4}+0] %; \
    /eval /set endurance    $[{P5}+0] %; \
    /eval /set willpower    $[{P6}+0] %; \
    /eval /set equilibrium	$[strstr({P7}, "e") != -1 ? 1 : 0] %; \
    /eval /set blind		$[strstr({P7}, "b") != -1 ? 1 : 0] %; \
    /eval /set deaf		$[strstr({P7}, "d") != -1 ? 1 : 0] %; \
    /eval /set balance_leftarm 	$[strstr({P7}, "l") != -1 ? 1 : 0] %; \
    /eval /set balance_rightarm $[strstr({P7}, "r") != -1 ? 1 : 0] %; \
    /eval /set balance    	$[strstr({P7}, "x") != -1 ? 1 : 0] %; \
    /eval /set kafe_ingested	$[strstr({P7}, "k") != -1 ? 1 : 0] %; \
    /eval /set prone		$[strstr({P7}, "p") != -1 ? 1 : 0]

A little explanation:

The {P#}+0 business removes the color codes from the strings, you
can't actually see them in the prompt but tf captures them anyway.

The strstr function I use appears to be very similar to the strchr
function you're using.  Your strchr searches for a character, my
strstr searches for a STRING.  I notice the first "b" in your prompts
is followed by a space, and the second by the ending "]".  If you
adjusted you string capturing stuff in your prompt trigger a bit, you
could do an strstr on "b " and "b ]".  That is of course dependent on
whether the space and "]" characters are always present when the "b"'s
are.  This would allow you to differentiate between the two "b"'s
(it's probably why the people who run your mud put the b's in those
positions).

Hope this was helpful, good luck getting it to work they way you'd like!

Ben

I was thinking this morning about string escaping/quoting. To write nested 
triggers with complicated regular expressions, I find myself using obscene 
amounts of backslashes, like this:

/def -mregexp -t"^ \\\\\\\\[([^\\\\\\\\]]+)\\\\\\\\] .*$$$"

to avoid the complaints when pedantic is on (which is a good thing!). 
Wouldn't it be worthwhile to take an idea from PHP and simplify this 
greatly?

What I mean is that in PHP, the parser treats different quotes 
differently. Double quotes are parsed so that you can embed variables in 
the strings (ie, "Name: $name") whereas single quotes are not. That would 
make it possible to declare:

/def -mregexp -t'^ \[([^\]]+)\] .*$'

at any level of nesting. The only area of ambiguity is dealing with a 
single quote inside a single quoted string.

Of course, maybe I'm going about this all wrong and I don't need all these 
damn slashes?

This note is to share my opinion on the TinyFugue status line 
customization protocol newly introduced in version 5 (i.e. use of 
/status_* macros instead of direct manipulation of %status_fields).

Having invested quite a bit of time in programming tf macros to manage 
automatic switching between multiple status line formats per MUD for 
multiple simultaneous SMAUG MUD sessions, I put off trying version 5 
for a long time after seeing that there had been large changes to 
status line handling. However, needing some new macros and not wanting 
to invest more time writing back-level code, I finally decided to bite 
the bullet and have successfully ported all my tf configuration to 
version 5.0 beta 6. 

During the transition, I became way too familiar with the following
message:

	Warning: the default definition of status_fields has changed 
	between tf version 4 and 5.  The recommended way to change 
	status_fields is by using /status_add, /status_rm, or 
	/status_edit.

Since tho old protocol of directly manipulating %status_fields still 
works, I think this message should be suppressible (e.g. display only 
once per session or control with %pedantic). As it is, spam from this 
message renders sessions that do any status line customization almost
unusable until every last "version 4-ism" has been rooted out.

The ability of /status_add to handle a list instead of just a single
field specification should definitely be documented. Accidentally
discovering this feature made a big difference in the amount of code
I had to write to upgrade my macros and completely changed my attitude 
toward the project.

It would be useful if /status_rm could handle a list of fields to 
remove.

There needs to be a single macro to reset status fields to some base 
state. It's particularly frustrating that the method of doing this 
documented in the (updated) version 5 help for "status line" (i.e. 
resetting %status_fields to %status_field_defaults) produces the 
dreaded warning-of-great-spam mentioned above. As it is, I had to 
introduce additional variables to track the state of the status line 
myself.

In summary, the discovery of multi-field /status_add made the 
transition to the new protocol much easier than I had feared, but 
required a significant increase in the complexity of some macros. 
Overall, I still can't see much benefit in the new protocol. While
the /status_* macros might be easier to use when there are only a 
small number of custom fields, and those don't get changed frequently,
for anything more complicated the old method of directly setting 
%status_fields was much more straightforward. Admittedly, status line 
customization is at present one tf's most difficult-to-use charm points,
but the /status_* macro protocol is not a good general solution. I would
prefer that the new protocol be supported in parallel with the old 
method rather than replace it.

Yes, use ^ to indicate a control in keybindings.

For example to use Ctrl-A to move cursor to beginning of the line
(this is already a default keybinding in TF 4):
	/def -b^A =3D /dokey home

Hello,

I found the autoenter macro (below) while browsing the archives, and I tried 
using it. I get this message after hitting enter on a blank line:

% autoenter: recursion count exceeded %max_recur (100)

What's that? How do I fix it?

Thanks in advance.

- Max


-----

I got it working for 5.0b4

Here is the final one

/def -i enter = \
        /if (!ismacro("autoenter")) \
                /echo *AUTOMAGIC ENTER ENABLED*%;\
                /def -i -F -mregexp -h"send ^$$"
autoenter = \
                        $$(/recall -i -mregexp - -3
.)%;\
        /else \
                /echo *AUTOMAGIC ENTER DISABLED*%;\
                /undef autoenter%;\
        /endif


(and if it puts an extra period after the -3, ignore
it)

The problem was I needed to tell the /def with the
send hook what time to match -- it was defaulting to
glob

I've written a couple macros to let me log ansi colors, but to capture 
leading spaces I have to use a ".*" regexp and %P0... Using %* doesn't 
show leading spaces, which totally screws up the logging. Is there any way 
to get the *exact* line without using a regular expression, so I can use 
the faster glob matching?

The problem in tf is that every level of /def (or /eval) nesting causes
another level of expansion, and because tf allows unquoted strings, it
can't know whether a quote in the next level is meaningful or not.

I am considering an alternate syntax that would eliminate all the levels
of textual substitutions and thus eliminate the need for all the escaping.
But don't expect that anytime soon.

One way around most of it is to put your string in a variable, then use the
variable where you need it:

  /set myregexp="^ \\[([^]]+)] .*$"

  /def ... = \
    /def ... = \
      /def -mregexp -t%%myregexp ...

I also elimiated the unnecessary backslashes before each ']'.

The macro is designed to be activated when you send a blank
line.  But if the line it picks as a replacement is also
blank, it goes into an infinite loop.  The message was tf
detecting this and stopping it after 100 loops.

Two changes to the macro will make it behave better:
1. use "/1" instead of "-3" as the /recall range, to search
   backwards for the last matching line, instead of exactly
   3 lines back (which might be a blank)
2. Use the "send()" function instead of an implicit send to send
   the replacement line.  send() will not invoke the SEND hook,
   so can not cause an infinite loop even if the replacement
   line is blank.  (And even with fix #1, the line can still
   be blank if you haven't typed anything into this tf session
   yet.)

Thus:

  /def -i enter = \
      /if (!ismacro("autoenter")) \
          /echo *AUTOMAGIC ENTER ENABLED*%;\
          /def -i -F -mregexp -h"send ^$$" autoenter = \
              /test send($$$(/recall -i -mregexp /1 .))%;\
      /else \
          /echo *AUTOMAGIC ENTER DISABLED*%;\
          /undef autoenter%;\

No, %P0 is the only way.  But don't worry about the speed; ".*" is a
very simple regexp, and quite fast.  Usually, if a regexp and glob _can_
do the same job, the glob will be _slightly_ faster; but there are lots
of things that regexps can do that globs can't, so don't hesitate to
use regexps when you need them.

How about a function that is the reverse of decode_ansi? Shouldn't be hard 
at all the way strings are handled internally! Very well organized, 
readable code.

It is suppressible, with "/set warn_status=off".  I'll put instructions
on this right in the message.

I didn't document it because I wasn't sure I'd keep it.  But I probably
will.  It's useful so you don't have to specify the position with -A
or -B for each field.

Not as useful as /status_add, and it may be tricky with fields that
contain spaces.  I'll think about it.

I've added a silent /status_defaults for the next release.

A major benefit of the new method is that when adding and removing fields
you don't have to touch the other fields.  If you /set status_fields
directly to add your "foo" field, then when a later version of tf adds
a new default field "bar", your /set will clobber the new version's
definition that includes "bar", even though it may be unrelated to your
"foo".  But if you'd used "/status_add foo", then you'll get both "foo"
and "bar".

A similar argument holds for macro libraries.  If you decide to give
out your SMAUG status macros to other users, and your macros /set
status_fields directly, they'll clober any customizations the user
has made.  But if your library uses the /status_* macros instead, the
user's customizations will stay intact.

Even if you don't give out your macros, the new commands are useful for
modularity within your own code.  There's no reason your smaug status
macros should need to know whether or not you want a clock field,
for example.  If you use the new /status_* commands, they don't have to.

For these reasons and others like them, I strongly discourage setting
status_fields directly.

Hello, these are several variable-related questions that have been puzzling 
me for awhile.

How do you save variables that constantly changes during the course of your 
mud session? When I start Tinyfugue, all my variables reset to nothing.

/set tmp Alvin|Simon|Theodore

I want to make an alias that can remove any value within that variable. For 
example, I want to take Simon out of my tmp variable. But I don't know 
how... in Zmud I can use a #deli <string>. Is there an equivalent in 
Tinyfugue?

Can I sort out a string alphabetically? For example, I have a haphazard 
variable with Simon|Theodore|Alvin in it. I want it alphabetically sorted to 
Alvin|Simon|Theodore. I looked up the help file for functions, but I don't 
see anything there that would do such a thing. If it's of any help, I use 
this equivalent in Zmud.

#var tmp %sort( @tmp)


And finally...

/def -b^[O = map

% test, line 49: DEF: '^[O' is a prefix of an existing keybinding.

How do I find out what that existing keybinding is (I don't have it 
defined), and how do I undefine it so that I can use my own? :)

Thank you very much in advance. Any help with these questions is greatly 
appreciated.

- Max Yiew

Hello,

You can save variables to file using a combination of /listvar and piping
to /writefile. See /help listvar and /help save for examples.

I don't know about sorting or that keybinding, but cutting a substring out
of a string isn't hard:

/def RemoveName \
=   /eval /set %1=$$[replace("%-1","",%1)] \
%;  /eval /set %1=$$[replace("||","|",%1)]

Call like:
/set tmp Alvin|Simon|Theodore
/RemoveName tmp Simon
/set tmp
% tmp=Alvin|Theodore

Note, the second replace is just to get rid of the extra |'s. You could
avoid that by always starting your arrays with a |
("|Alvin|Simon|Theodore"). That makes array operations and things like
empty array detection a lot easier.

Note 2, (AFAIK) TinyFugue doesn't have built-in array handling, so you
either have to roll your own (a great way to learn good tf scripting), use
the library scripts or ask nicely for someone else's scripts.

Peter.

Sorry to ask such simple questions, but I still haven't fully gotten
used to all the syntax yet, so here goes.

1) Trying to setup a curing function that runs in conjunction with the
diag command used in IRE games.  If you haven't seen it it the output
of it looks pretty much like this...

You are:
Unnaturally stupid
Annorexic
Reckless

What I'd like to do is have a hook or something of that nature that
would run with diag and temporarily set triggers to turn variables on
like, reckless=1, annorexic=1, stupid=1, for example everytime it is
run, then disable the triggers while the function isn't called.  I
sort of grasp how to make the hook, and how I would get the variables
turned on, but not how to end it once it gets the job done.

2) I'm also trying to setup a next command feature, that relies on
balance and such.  So if I were to for example attack twice, it would
attack the first time, and then issue the second attack once balance
was recovered.  Sounds a little sketchy, but I've seen it done before.
 Any help, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   Thanks.

I'd like to perform a replace() operation where a pattern is used to
match the thing to replace rather than an exact string.  Is there a way
to do this?  If not directly, is it possible given the language?  Any
suggestions are welcome.

Henry.

I keep the triggers on all the time but only pay attention if I've typed
diagnose and then see You are: . Just use variables to track stuff and
then only set your affliction variables if doing_diagnose and seen_youare
are both set to 1. stuff like that.

/require alias.tf

/alias diag /do_diag_trigs

/def do_diag_trigs = \
	/def -mglob -t'Unnaturally stupid' diag_stupid = /do_heal_stupid %; \
	/def -mglob -t'Annorexic' diag_annorexic = /do_heal_annorexic %; \
	/def -mglob -t'Reckless' diag_reckless = /do_heal_reckless %; \
	/send diag

/def do_heal_stupid = Do What You Need %; /undo_diag_trigs
/def do_heal_annorexic = Do What You Need %; /undo_diag_trigs
/def do_heal_reckless = Do What You Need %; /undo_diag_trigs

/def undo_diag_trigs = /undef diag_stupid %; \
	/undef diag_annorexic %; /undef diag_reckless

OK, here's the breakdown of what I did here...When you type 
"diag"...tf intercepts it and does not actually send it to the MUD 
(yet). Instead, it runs the alias, which in turn calls 
"/do_diag_trigs". The purpose of "/do_diag_trigs" is (first) set up 
the triggers, and (second) send "diag" to the MUD. I am running on 
the assumption that one, and *only* one, of those things is reported 
to you when you type "diag" (I don't play IRE's stuff). Based on that 
assumption, when the first one is received, it does what the heal is, 
and it then turns off all of the trigs. If it is not that way, 
there's 2 other ways to turn off the trigs. One would be to have a 
fourth trigger that triggers off either a bottom delimeter, or 
triggers off your next prompt. The second would be to change the 
bottom of do_diag_trigs to:
	/send diag %; \
	/repeat -5 1 /undo_diag_trigs

That repeat line tells tf to wait 5 seconds & then turn off the 
triggers. If you often use diag after much command stacking or for 
some other reason will be likely to have more than 5 seconds lag 
between typing diag & seeing the output, just change the 5 to 
something else.

Then of course you may want additional triggers for the fail message 
for each of those things that re-does the heal, which should be added 
to the /undo_diag_trigs (or you can keep them full-time so they'll 
work when you manually heal as well).

I'd need a bit more info on that, but you can probably build off what 
Adrian had posted to you back in October (subject was Re: [TF] Re: 
TinyFugue Digest, Vol 21, Issue 19).

Hope this helps,
Mike

Most likely the problem isn't actually in TF, but perhaps the solution
is, so I thought I'd ask here.

I'm trying to define macros that would allow walking with the keypad.
I've done this before, but since I changed distros (To Ubuntu, a
Debian-based one, in case that has any relevance) I've not been able to
do it. Some of the keys work, although in a wonky kind of way. Hitting 7
on the keypad gives "% #438: key_f9: no such command or macro" From
keypad 0 to 9, it says this: 
0 -> % #443: key_nkp3: no such command or
macro                                     
1 -> % #442: key_nkp1: no such command or
macro                                     
2 -> % #440: key_nkp5: no such command or
macro                                     
3 -> % #441: key_nkp9: no such command or
macro                                     
4 -> % #434: key_f5: no such command or
macro                                       
5 -> % #435: key_f6: no such command or
macro                                       
6 -> % #436: key_f7: no such command or
macro                                       
7 -> % #438: key_f9: no such command or
macro                                       
8 -> % #290: key_nkp8: no such command or
macro                                     
9 -> % #292: key_nkp9: no such command or macro

The actual F9 differs slightly from the not-f9 that's actually nkp7:
F9 -> % #318: key_f9: no such command or macro
nkp7 -> % #438: key_f9: no such command or macro

I've tried a bunch of different terminals from rxvt to Eterm, all with
keypad set to on and off, but I haven't been able to come up with a
solution. Can't seem to bind them with "/def -b"^[0s"" and the like
either, "% DEF: '^[0s' is prefixed by an existing keybinding"

There's propably an easy way to get around this, but nothing I've tried
seems to work, and I haven't found anyone with a similar problem and
solution to ask.

Try using the program 'xev' (which should be in the ubuntu distro) and 
see exactly what codes are produced by the numpad keys. Then try using 
that as input to your macros.

Hello everyone,

/set fruit apple|green fruit|pink fruit

/eval /def -t"^You eat a (%fruit)\." fruit = \
	/echo You feel less hungry. %; \
	/if ({fruit} =~ "apple") \
		/set eaten apple %; \
	/endif

However, /listdef only shows:

% 1489: /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^You eat a (apple|green fruit|pink fruit).' 
fruit = /echo You feel less hungry.

What happened to the rest of my script? How do I make /eval run through it 
all instead of stopping after the first command? What am I doing wrong?

If I remove /eval, the macro shows up fine... except that it doesn't 
recognize %fruit which I set at the beginning.

Thank you in advance.

- Max Yiew

I saw a few older messages on this but didn't see any about it being
resolved.
(The one where tf gets weird/random/incessant input in an rxvt/xterm, but
works in the dos type window.)

After fiddling around with the source I found a possible workaround:
It seems to work if you change VMIN from 0 to 1 in tty.c:cbreak_noecho_mode.

This appears to be a cygwin bug of some kind, but am posting here in case
it is useful to anyone.

(This is on Win 98.. sigh. :)

In case this is still pending, I think you just need double %'s as
separators for the /def.  e.g. /echo You feel less hungry. %%; \
(The /eval then turns %%; into %;)

I use 'screen', and keep the main log file open in 'less' in another 
session.   Screen has a split screen mode, so it would be easy to do it 
that way.

Note that in unix-like systems, it's often a separate program that 
provides additional functionality. Modularity is the unix way :)

Cheers,
Damian

Hi. New to the list, not to TF. I went back through a few months of the
archives to see this Split-screen scrollback thread. It's rather similar
to the kind of thing I'm looking to do. 

I, well, the denizens of the MOO i'm on, would really like 2 (new?) sets
of functionality that would work well together. 

The first is some form of virtual world interface where we would have
seperate virtual worlds that are not connected to other hosts, but
otherwise do behave in the same way as other worlds (ie. show up in world
lists and can be accessed via fg & the world hopping key bindings and have
their own history buffers etc.) The reasoning is that we would like to
take certain parts of our MOO and have it go to a completely seperate
area. Things like our jabber (and all IM transport) integration would go
well in another virtual world, despite it going through the MOO. Or, a way
to have our IRC macros split the different channels on one server into
their own worlds. I don't suppose that there's a way to do this right now
with some tricks using tfstreams or something similar? Perhaps some form
internal socket generation that I haven't found documented? 

And, it goes without saying that this kind of virtual world functionality
would just go really well with split-screen.

In my quest for ansi logging, I created a macro that would accomplish it 
rather inefficiently, with a noticeable slowdown on strings with numerous 
attributes. So, I hacked together an "encode_ansi" function that acts very 
much like the "encode_attr" function, only embedding ANSI codes rather 
than TF codes. Combine this with the normal TF file output functions and 
you can get your ansi logging without a performance impact. Enjoy!

Hi I posted about the unconnected worlds issue earlier, got that one
figured out. Though a split screen would still be nice. :-> 

Anyway, I upgraded to tf5 last week sometime. And while I like most of the
changes, I'm stymied by this one problem. I'm not getting the More prompt
on the status line! 

% status_fields= :1 @more:8:BCwhite,Cbgred :1 userstat::Ccyan :1 @read:6 :1 @active:11 :1 @world:8:Cgreen :1 @mail:1 :1 insert:1 :1 @log:1 :1 @clock:5
% more=on

As you can see, more is on and the I have the @more on the line. However,
moresize() and morepaused() always return 0, so the status_int_more never
thinks there's any thing below the screen. Hitting tab or pgdn gets me
through the rest of what's waiting.

Any ideas?

After working it out with some friends, we've got a patch. Turns out that
morepaused() and moresize() weren't taking virtscreen=off into account. 

He changed it and I'm including the (untested by me) patch. So, thank Pete
Young.

What I'm having problems with seems to be only applicable to IRE
games, but if you can come up with a solution I would greatly
appreciate it anyway, so here goes.  When  I get an affliction, I have
to eat a herb to cure it.  I do this like so...

/if (bloodroot & !aeon & herb_bal & !anorexic & !stun) /bloodroot%;/endif

/def -Fp5 -mglob -t'You eat a bloodroot leaf.' bloodroottrig=/set
herb_bal=0%;/if (bloodroot) /set bloodroot=0%;outc bloodroot%;/endif

/def -Fp0 -mglob -t'You may eat another plant.' herbbal=/set
herb_bal=1%;/set eating=0

Anyway that's the gist of it, the way I intended it to work, is that
it brings the eats bloodroot once, and once it recieves the message
that it has eaten it, it turns off the variable herb_bal, so I don't
eat it repeatedly.  Then when it recieves the message that I can eat
another plant the conditional will once again fire.  Yet it seems like
no matter what it will eat multiple times while in arena, (you have
unlimited herbs out in the arena).   So basically, I'm looking for a
way to make sure I'm eating the herb with the trigger I'm using, but
not allow it to try and eat 4-5 times.  It does this with all the
other triggers I have like this as well, salves, etc.  Any input of
any kind on how to limit the amount of eats coming from the
conditional while making sure they're going through would be
appreciated.  Thank you.

the trouble is that there is a period of time between when you receive
the affliction (and register it) and when you've eaten the actual herb.
I have three state 'timers' for my balances - have balance, tried to eat/apply,
successfully eaten/applied. Whenever I /try/ to eat/apply I set the timer
to that state - which will, if not upgraded to the third state within a small
period (one second for most) will assume I 'forgot' or couldn't otherwise
perform the action and drop me back down to having balance again.

Food for thought

Don't bother with this trig...put these within /bloodroot. Your 
problem is that you're sending the command to eat the second time 
before this text is received, or maybe it's being shown tacked after 
your prompt (or other text) & thus not triggering, since glob is 
implicitly anchored.

Hi.
I've found two things that make tf seg fault.
The first is calling strip_attr (with any argument), say like:

/test strip_attr("blah")

I get:
>TinyFugue version 5.0 beta 6
>Linux #1 Wed Feb 9 02:43:46 GMT 2005 2.6.8-mppe
>-core +float +ftime +history +IPv6 +locale +MCCPv1 +MCCPv2 +process -SOCKS 
>-ssl +subsecond +TZ
>virtscreen=1, visual=1, expnonvis=0, emulation=3, lp=1, sub=1
>TERM="screen"
>cmd="strip_attr"
>Abnormal termination - signal 11


Also, attempting to use += to add something to a constant, like say:

/test 1+=1

segfaults instead of returning an error. The same applies to the other _= 
operators.
For this I get:

>TinyFugue version 5.0 beta 6
>Linux #1 Wed Feb 9 02:43:46 GMT 2005 2.6.8-mppe
>-core +float +ftime +history +IPv6 +locale +MCCPv1 +MCCPv2 +process -SOCKS

>virtscreen=1, visual=1, expnonvis=0, emulation=3, lp=1, sub=1
>TERM="screen"
>cmd="strip_attr"
>Abnormal termination - signal 11


I can probably figure out how to do a stack trace if wanted but I assume 
they will reproduce easily.

You have pasted two same seg. faults.

Second is different:

¤=> /test 1+=1

Please report the following message verbatim to hawkeye@tcp.com.
Also describe what you were doing in tf when this
occured, and whether you can repeat it.

Reported this one before. Wrote a patch for it and sent it to Ken, but I
haven't heard back about it yet. Can be found as part of:

http://http.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/t/tf5/tf5_5.0beta6-3.diff.gz

(look for '100_stripattr_segv.patch'; I can extract it and email it to
the list if people really need it in a more obvious form)

[ snip duplicate core from strip_attr ]

As someone else noted, this appears to be a duplicate of the first core.
However, I can reproduce this with the given command, with the resulting
core information:

An initial tf5 package has been uploaded to Debian's experimental
archive (maintained by yours truly). If you meet the following criteria,
I would *really* appreciate it if you'd install this package and give me
feedback on it.

The criteria are:

* You're system is Debian, or a Debian derived distribution

* You're willing to try an experimental tf5 package

* You either don't need 'tf' (TinyFugue 4.x) installed, or are willing
  to upgrade to the latest version of it in unstable/testing (which adds
  support for using the 'alternatives' system to pick between tf4 and
  tf5 when you type 'tf').

* You don't need SSL support (for license reasons, Debian cannot
  distribute a binary which is pre-linked to OpenSSL without changes to
  the current license of TF, despite it being perfectly OK to build it
  on a local system with that linkage).

Given some of the things Ken has said he's probably changing in beta 7,
including a couple of bugs this package works around in terms of rarely
used --configure arguments and such, I'm likely to wait for beta 7 to come
out before I upload to 'unstable'. But having user feedback on beta 6
"in the wild" will certainly make it easier to feel comfortable that the
package is of a high enough quality to be useful to folks.

Please note that 'experimental' means just that - if it breaks, you get to
keep both pieces, though I *am* obviously interested in fixing anything
that goes that badly; if you don't know how to install from Debian's
experimental area, and can't find the information on Google, that's a
strong hint that you probably shouldn't be running anything out of it in
the first place; it is not for the faint of heart or the inexperienced.

Are there more colors available to TF, in whatever way, than the ones 
listed in the manual?

Thanks.

Hello Shan,

AFAIK, the colours in TinyFugue are based on the colours and attributes
available on a standard ANSI terminal. Most terminals simply don't support
more colours than that. I believe there is a special 256-colour X Terminal,
but you probably have to hack your own support for that. (Ie, start messing
about with echo'ing escape codes.)

Regards,

Peter.

I believe modern gnome terminals support 256 colours, too.

There was a 256 color support patch for 4, but it hasn't been ported
to 5 yet. I had high hopes that 256 color support would be built in
to one of the latest versions, but so far no dice.

I've been looking for a way to get better logging while having visual
mode on, that would display the prompt, and possibly the commands
entered as well.  I had a setup working with a send hook, but that
conflicted with some others that I had.  Any suggestions would be
helpful.

Hi,

Not sure if this is helpful, but long, long ago, I used my ssh client's
builtin logging functionality to generate complete ansi logs, that could
be 'played back' as it were.

If your client/terminal doesn't support logging, perhaps you could look
into piping the terminal, or even running tf through a telnet session with
a network T attached.

Reading the logs will be hell though, which is why I stopped logging that
way. But maybe you can use it. I remember making creative use of head,
scroll-lock and a low-baud terminal to play them back.

Regards,

Peter.

if you search the archives (can you? :) you'll find a post from me
listing how I do it.

To summarise:

/def dolog = \
        /echo -aCcyan "*** ENABLING LOGGING TO %1.log" %; \
        /eval /set lfile=$[strcat({1}, ".log")] %; \
        /eval /log -g $[lfile] %; \
        /test tfclose(outlog) %; \
        /eval /set outlog=$[tfopen($[lfile], "a")] %; \
        /def -q -Fp999999 -hSEND trig_send_log = /test tfwrite(outlog, strcat("SENT:", {*})) %; \
        /def -q -Fp999999 -hPROMPT trig_prompt_log = /test tfwrite(outlog, {*})

Which adds:

* logging what is seen via /log
* logging what is sent via the fallthrough trig_send_log
* seperately logging the prompt, since its a different hook, via trig_prompt_log

try calling this with the name of your logfile to append to, eg

/dolog /tmp/newlog.log

tailing it should then show what you send /and/ receive.

Hello,

How does one go about matching strings that are longer than a word in 
length?

/if ({P1} =/ "lightly burdened")

Doesn't work. I found out later that glob will never match more than a word. 
So I tried

/if ({P1} =~ "lightly burdened")

Which also doesn't work. So I tried using /def -msubstr instead of -mregexp 
even though I have no clue what -msubstr is. Doesn't work either.

I would appreciate any light shed on this. Thank you.

Regards,
Max.

Actually, both of those would work perfectly fine.

/def -mregexp -t'You are ([a-z ]+)' test_eval = \
      /if ({P1} =~ "lightly burdoned" ) /echo You're Lightly Burdoned %; \
      /elseif ({P1} =~ "heavily burdoned" ) /echo You've Got too much 
stuff. %; \
      /else /echo I dunno how much you've got %; \
      /endif

Then try:
/trigger You are heavily burdoned
/trigger You are lightly burdoned
/trigger You are lightly laden

and you'll see that it works. Perhaps you're mistaking the use of {P1}.

Hello,
I wrote a patch that works well witch tf50b6.

It was not a big problem, because Ken wrote almost everything into tf what
is needed for 256 colors.

The patch and all needed files (even putty that handle 256 colors) can be
found on my site www.ingwar.eu.org/tf/ (Now only in download page)

I think that in new version of tf suport for 256 colors will be bild in, so
patches will be useless.

And may be Ken will apply other patches from my site, like multistatus witch
is very usefull.

Regards,
Karol

I believe modern gnome terminals support 256 colours, too.

hiya,                                                                                                         
                                                                                                              
i'm sure i've asked this before or i've seen the answer before.                                               
                                                                                                              
i'd like to get the contents of a variable whose name is /inside/                                             
a variable.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                              
eg, I have two variables - a and b. a contains 'b', b contains '1'.                                           
I'd like to be able to get at the contents of the variable referenced

Hi!

I think you should something like this:
/def foo = /let a=1%;/let b=a%;/eval /echo %%{%{b}}
Try it!

So, thanks to Karol Lassak multi-line status line patch I've finally been
able to implement the "tabbed" tf that people I know have been talking
about for years, since seeing a tabbed browser. 

It's here, with screenshots: http://www.wacked.org:8888/~heller/tf_tabs/

The gist of it is that each world has tabs that can be cycled through
seperately from the tabs. We use meta-up/down to cycle through tabs and
meta-left/right to cycle through worlds. This way we can seperate the
non-roleplaying aspects of the mud from the roleplaying aspects. We keep
certain +com channels off on seperate tabs using triggers to minimize
spamish effects. 

Anyway, I just thought you'ld all like to know because you've unwittingly
being a big help because of all the questions that I got answered by
reading the list and its archives.

How do I set some binding to only respond to the numberpad keys,
without activating on the top row of numbers?

I'm running Mac OS X Panther, with the bash shell.

Thanks in advance!

Hi all!

I have a little problem with using TF with Putty. TF seems to 
destroy/not update the scrollback history.

For example if I type list (having a more than 1000 lines listing) I can 
only see the tail that fits on the screen scrolling up does not show the 
rest (the scrollbar does not change its size too).

Anybody out there who can help or point me to the right direction?

I'm using Windows XP, Putty 0.57 (0.58 throws an error at startup), TF 
Versions tried are 5.0b6 and 5.0b6

In the 4.0s1 version the scrolling works as expected.


Thanks in advance
 Ralf

Firstly - I need a way to stop a macro from being used more than once
every 2 seconds, I've tried using /edit -c0 But it doesn't seem to
work, the macro will still work fine.

Also, the more complicated question....
I need a macro to rub a poison on a knife, I'd like to use the  command: rkman
I need Tinyfugue to take out the three letters after rk, and then take
that, in the instance of man, turn it into mandrake and use it in the
rest of the macro.
If it's possible I'd also like to make it pick out two sets of three
letters, like: rkmangri - So it will take the poisons mandrake and
grimleaf then rub them on my knife.

Thanks in Advance,
Brian

This shows how it works:

/set mymac_delay=5

/def mymac = \
   /if ( {block_mymac} = 1 ) \
       /echo No execution now%;\
   /else \
       /set block_mymac=1%;\
       /repeat -%{mymac_delay} 1 /set block_mymac=0%;\
       /echo Now I execute whatever you like%;\
   /endif

Try this:

/def -mregexp -h'SEND ^rk([A-Za-z]*)' poison_hook = \
   /set tplist=%{P1}%;\
   /unset poison%;\
   /while (strlen({tplist}) >=3 ) \
       /test poison:=substr({tplist},0,3)%;\
       /test tplist:=substr({tplist},3)%;\
       /eval /send get %%{poison} bag%;\
       /eval /send poison weapon %%{poison}%;\
   /done

Or whatever your commands might be...but you'll get the idea ;-)

Greetings
Ralf

Alternatively,

/set mymac_delay=5
/set mymac_time=0
/set mymac_newtime=

/def mymac = \
  /test mymac_newtime := time()%;\
  /if (mymac_newtime > mymac_time + mymac_delay) \

I'm trying to get tf to take my input of three unique letters (the
first three letters of the full word), and then use the full word they
stand for in the rest of the alias.

Thanks in Advance.

Perhaps something like the following could be of some use:

/def -i -p30 -mregexp -h"SEND (^|[^A-Za-z])atm([^A-Za-z]|$)" expand_atm = \
     /trigger -hSEND $[strcat({PL}, {P1}, "at the moment", {P2}, {PR})]

I'm trying to launch a program from tf without making tf halt. I'm not 
concerned about
reading stdout or anything, I just want the program to run.
I can make the program run like this but, of course, tf waits for it to 
finish:
	/sys echo "test"|flite

If I try to run in the background I get "!sh: line 1: bg: no job control":
	/sys bg echo "test test test"|flite

This works in the foreground and doesn't even display a message like "no job 
control":
	/sys (echo "test test test"|flite &)

I've read that you cannot do job control in bash if there is no tty (as 
seems the
case with /sys) so I've tried using other shells also.

So, how can I start a process and let tf continue running?

Thanks in advance for any help.

Ian

Subject: [TF] Starting a process in the background from tf


I'm trying to launch a program from tf without making tf halt. I'm not 
concerned about
reading stdout or anything, I just want the program to run.
I can make the program run like this but, of course, tf waits for it to 
finish:
	/sys echo "test"|flite

If I try to run in the background I get "!sh: line 1: bg: no job control":
	/sys bg echo "test test test"|flite

This works in the foreground and doesn't even display a message like "no job

control":
	/sys (echo "test test test"|flite &)

I've read that you cannot do job control in bash if there is no tty (as 
seems the
case with /sys) so I've tried using other shells also.

So, how can I start a process and let tf continue running?

Thanks in advance for any help.

Ian

/sh and /psh attach the tty, so you can do job control.

Is this an arbitrary execution, or is it always something specific? 
If it is something specific, you could put the execution into a shell 
script & execute that.

#!/bin/sh
# Do the program launch
echo "test"|flite &

Then /sys /path/to/file

The wrapper script will exit as soon as flite is spawned, so you'll 
return immediately.

TF 5 has its own built-in scrolling, which overrides your terminal's
scrolling.  Use the PageUp and PageDown keys to scroll within tf.
(I have used this with PuTTy myself, and it works fine.)
Other keys are also available; see "/help scrolling".

I've been quiet on the mailing list for a while, but I haven't been
ignoring it.  I've packed lots of new features into version 5.0 beta 7,
which I will likely release within the next week.

Two features previously available through third-party patches are now
standard:  256 color xterm support, and multi-line status bar.  However,
the interface is not exactly the same as in the patches, so anyone using
those patches will need to make some changes.

Full list of changes:

Added support for 256 color xterms.
Added encode_ansi() to generate a string with ANSI display codes.
Added test() for backward compatiblity with version 4.0.
Added strcmpattr(), like strcmp() but also compares display attributes.
In commands that match macros (/list, /purge, /save), a color attribute will
    match only the same color attribute, not just any color attribute.
/list, /listvar, /listworlds, and /listsockets can sort their results.
Added -n option to /listsockets to print host and port in numeric form.
%Pn, %L, and %R subs are now case sensitive, to reduce collisions with regular
    variables.
/prompt preserves embedded display attributes in its argument.
CONNECT hook includes SSL cipher name.
Added -f (foreground) and -b (background) options to /world; documented -x
    (SSL) option.
Status bar changes:
    Status bar can be multiple rows, determined by %status_height.
    /status_{add,edit,rm} commands take an -r option to specify which row.
    Added /status_defaults to restore default status bar fields; use of
        %status_field_defaults is deprecated.
    Added "/status_save <name>" and "/status_restore <name>" to save and
        restore a named set of status fields.
    Fixed: "/status_add -x name:width:attr" failed to detect existing field
        with name if its width or attr were different.
    Fixed: status_attr_{int,var}_* variables sometimes had no effect. (50b5)
    Fixed: any attempt to set %status_pad in .tfrc failed if %visual had not
        yet been explicitly set (also, in a RESIZE hook caused by a terminal
        resize while in /suspend or /sh, but that's much less common). (50a13)
Other screen display changes:
    Changing %wrappunct immediately rewraps everything on screen.
    Eliminated extra screen redraw when the terminal is resized.
    Fixed: under some conditions, rewrapping screen could cause entire
        scrollback buffer to be redrawn, instead of just a screenful.  (If
        %more was on, this acted like a jump to the beginning of the buffer.)
    Fixed: did not send new terminal size to server after resizing the terminal
        in nonvisual mode.
    Workaround for a window resize bug in Konsole.
Keyboard changes:
    Workaround for incomplete linux console terminfo entry which was preventing
        %keypad from working.
    Added friendlier message for using undefined named keys.
    Improved documentation for numeric keypad, including instructions for
        using it with some specific terminal emulators. (See "/help keypad".)
    Added missing names for numeric keypad keys:  key_nkpTab key_nkpEnt
        key_nkp* key_nkp+ key_nkp, key_nkp- key_nkp. key_nkp/ key_nkp=
    Added default keybindings for shift-tab, sun function keys, and
        vt220 function keys F13 - F20.
    Fixed incorrect keybindings for bottom two rows of numeric keypad in some
        environments.
Installation changes:
    ./configure now honors options --exec-prefix, --bindir, --datadir,
        --program-prefix, --program-suffix, and --program-transform-name.
    ./configure --enable-version does not automatically --enable-symlink.
    Installation directory for tf-lib now defaults to PREFIX/share instead of
        PREFIX/lib (configurable with --datadir).
    Fixed ./configure --enable-mailcheck=DIR.
ftime() now returns an empty string instead of an incorrect string if the time
    is out of range (in addition to printing an error message).
Time period values of 60s or larger are printed in h:mm[:ss.u] format.  This
    applies to %alert_time, %maildelay, %prompt_wait, %ptime, idle(), sidle(),
    and values derived from them (but not time() and mktime(), which are
    absolute time values).
The CONFAIL and CONNETFAIL hooks did not previously behave as documented.  The
    CONNETFAIL hook has been removed; the new ICONFAIL hook is called for a
    connection failure if there are more possible addresses to try, and the
    CONFAIL hook is called for a connection failure on the last address.  (If
    you had worked around the buggy behavior by duplicating CONFAIL and
    CONNETFAIL hooks, you will probably want to go back to using the CONFAIL
    hook only.)
Improved error checking for /repeat arguments.
Fixed spurious error for "/break" without arguments at end of macro body.
Fixed: a macro with no other statements outside of an "/if (expr)" statement
    was incorrectly treated as an error, causing any macro that called it
    to abort.
Fixed: "/set var " (with trailing space) was setting var to blank instead
    of printing its value.
/listworlds and /listsockets ignore trailing space.
Fixed: /runtime incorrectly evaluated its return value.
Fixed: new -= operator added instead of subtracted.
Fixed crash if left side of new += -= *= /= operators was not assignable.
Fixed crash in strip_attr(). (50b5)
Fixed crash in /list -P.
Fixed class of crashes involving certain generated empty strings in macros:
    - attribute strings in echo(), substitute(), and decode_attr()
    - macro names
    - expression operands
    - etc.
Will not crash if a bug in tf or library code supplies an invalid string in
    an error message.
Strengthened check for TERMCAP corruption by broken *csh.
Fixed moresize() and morepaused() with virtscreen=off (undocumented).

/quote works asynchronously.  If you don't want the process's output,
throw it away.

    /quote -0 !echo "test" | flite >/dev/null

Hi,
I'm trying to get our macro packages working under tf5 but am experiencing
some problems.

First: I expected the status_attr_var_ mechanism to evaluate the contents
of these variables like the status_var_ variables to get the attributes
for displaying the field on the status line. Unfortunately only a raw
attribute value is displayed correctly, rendering this variable quite useless.

I'd like these variable to behave like their status_var_ counterparts, e.g.
being evaluated for the attribute value if the associated Variable changes.

/set status_attr_var_hp=(hp>100)?"Cgreen":"Cred"

The second problem relates to the behaviour of the /set (and perhaps other)
commands when being used in the command line or files.
In tf4 the line was not evaluated/expanded at all.

In tf5 it is not possible to do:

/set way=n%;n%;e%;e%;climb up

only the first value is set to the variable all other are send to the current
socket. If macros appear in the variable they are evaluated, although sub is
off.

Imho this is a bug and breaks lots of code.

Michael

Well i myself have another problem.
One one mud, after a bit long time of playing, my scrolling back get
broken. I can only scrollback 2, most 3 screens back. The history still
works good, i can /recall 5000 or so, but can't scroll it back.

Any clues?

hello everybody!

im an connected via ssh to a host where i am running tf. my numpad-numbers
are working properly, but instead of sending the command to the mud with
(numpad-)ENTER, i get [OM (similarily for the *-/+ signs))

maybe there is an easy explanation/solution to this problem, thanks in
advance!

I believe that is strict VT100 emulation, least I think. You can just
use this binding:

/def -b'^[OM' = /dokey NEWLINE

Hi.

I was wondering if I could use TF with Xboard ICS (Internet Chess
Server) protocol.
This is a plain telnet interface, to connect to a free chess server,
like 'freechess.org 5000'.

According to http://linuxgazette.net/112/creighton.html , this is
possible with irssi.
I was curious if anyone could help me hook this up.

Thanks.

Anyone know if there is a way to do two line triggers in TF, if so an
example would be very helpful, thank you.

TF does not support two line triggers as it is, but I've seen a few
crafty scripting hacks cross these boards that make it work.  Here's
how I do it:

Let's say you want to trigger the following text:

----
This is the first line of the trigger text, blah blah blah and
this is the second line of the text.
----

You'd like some code to be executed when that text appears on your screen.

Create a trigger (/def) for the first line.  This first trigger will
do any highlighting, gagging and whatnot to the first line.  Then it
will CREATE the /def for the second trigger (the second trigger will
be a ONE SHOT trigger).  After x number of seconds the first trigger
/undef's the second trigger (in case it didn't fire, you'll need to
gag or disable the error message for the attempt to /undef a trigger
that doesn't exist).  The second trigger will contain the actual code
you want to execute.

Something like this:

My text line 1.
Here is the second line.

/def -t'My text line 1.' first_trig = \
    /def -p2 -n1 -t'Here is the second line.' second_temporary_trig = \
       /undef third_temporary_trig%%;\
       /send say I found my two lines...%%;\
       /send say What now?%;\
    /def -p1 -n1 -t'*' third_temporary_trig = /undef second_temporary_trig

Little explanation:

You define a trigger that matches the first line, which then defines two 
triggers.
1st trigger fires at the first line. The other triggers fire on the 
lines following. If the second line does not match the wanted one, the 
trigger 'third_temporary_trig' gets fired and undefines the temporary 
trigger for the second line. If the second line is matched, trigger 
'second_temporary_trig' fires (it fires first because of higher priority 
-p2) and undefines the 'third_temporary_trig'.

The %%; is needed to make a list of commands that are executed by the 
firing of the second trigger.

Hope this helps.

Greetings
 Ralf

The "have 1st trigger define the 2nd trigger" works, you can also base 
the 2nd trigger on an evaluation set by the 1st.  Using the same example 
text as before:

/def -t'This is the first line of the trigger text, blah blah blah and' 
trig1 = /do whatever%;/set multiLine=1

/def -E'multiLine' -t'this is the second line of the text.' trig2 = 
/do_something_else%;/set multiLine=0

trig2 will only be fired if "multiLine" is not 0, and the only case it's 
not zero is if trig1 fires.

----------------

Note that all these situations have a limitation - If you get line#1 
without line#2, and then at some later point get line#2, it'll act as if 
they came right next to each other.

A solution to this would to be to write a trigger similar to the 2nd 
(gets defined by the 1st, or based on an evaluation) that trigs on ANY 
line, and has the effect of disabling the 2nd trigger (either by 
undef-ing it, or by unsetting the variable).

TinyFugue 5.0 beta 7 is now available at http://tf.tcp.com/.

Changes (NOT identical to the change list I mailed out a week ago):

5.0 beta 7 (2005-04-17)
----------
Colors:
    Added 16-color names: "gray", "brightred"..."brightwhite".
    Added 256-color names: "rgb000"..."rgb555" and "gray0"..."gray23".
    Added predefined codes for xterm 256-color extension.
    Functions decode_ansi() and encode_ansi() work with xterm 256-color
	extension codes.
    Added "/feature 256colors".
    Added "/load testcolor.tf" to test color functionality and appearance.
Added "E" and "W" attributes, with corresponding defintions in %error_attr
    and %warning_attr.
Added encode_ansi() to generate a string with attribute control codes.
Added test() for backward compatiblity with version 4.0.
Added strcmpattr(), like strcmp() but also compares display attributes.
In commands that match macros (/list, /purge, /save), a color attribute will
    match only the same color attribute, not just any color attribute.
/list, /listvar, /listworlds, and /listsockets can sort their results.
Added -n option to /listsockets to print host and port in numeric form.
%Pn, %L, and %R subs are now case sensitive, to reduce collisions with regular
    variables.
/prompt preserves embedded display attributes in its argument.
CONNECT hook includes SSL cipher name.
Added -f (foreground) and -b (background) options to /world; documented -x
    (SSL) option.
Uses system's copy of libpcre if possible.
Redefinition of macros or keybindings does not invoke the REDEF hook if the
    new and old defintions are identical (so file reloading is less noisy).
    If you used to gag REDEF to reduce noise, you may want to ungag it now
    that it is less noisy and more informative.
Status bar changes:
    Status bar can be multiple rows, determined by %status_height.
    /status_{add,edit,rm} commands take an -r option to specify which row.
    Added status_fields(<row>) to get fields of <row>.
    Added /status_defaults to restore default status bar fields; use of
	%status_field_defaults is deprecated.
    Added "/status_save <name>" and "/status_restore <name>" to save and
	restore a named set of status fields.
    The variable width field may be right-justified by giving it width "-0".
    Fixed: /status_edit did not work on a variable-width field.
    Fixed: "/status_add -x name:width:attr" failed to detect existing field
	with name if its width or attr were different.
    Fixed: status_attr_{int,var}_* variables sometimes had no effect. (50b5)
    Fixed: any attempt to set %status_pad in .tfrc failed if %visual had not
	yet been explicitly set (also, in a RESIZE hook caused by a terminal
	resize while in /suspend or /sh, but that's much less common). (50a13)
Other screen display changes:
    Changing %wrappunct immediately rewraps everything on screen.
    Eliminated extra screen redraw when the terminal is resized.
    Fixed: under some conditions, rewrapping screen could cause entire
	scrollback buffer to be redrawn, instead of just a screenful.  (If
	%more was on, this acted like a jump to the beginning of the buffer.)
    Fixed: did not send new terminal size to server after resizing the terminal
	in nonvisual mode.
    Workaround for a window resize bug in Konsole.
Keyboard changes:
    Workaround for incomplete linux console terminfo entry which was preventing
	%keypad from working.
    Added friendlier message for using undefined named keys.
    Improved documentation for numeric keypad, including instructions for
	using it with some specific terminal emulators. (See "/help keypad".)
    Added missing names for numeric keypad keys:  key_nkpTab key_nkpEnt
	key_nkp* key_nkp+ key_nkp, key_nkp- key_nkp. key_nkp/ key_nkp=
    Added default keybindings for shift-tab, sun function keys, and
	vt220 function keys F13 - F20.
    Fixed incorrect keybindings for bottom two rows of numeric keypad in some
	environments.
Installation changes:
    ./configure now honors options --exec-prefix, --bindir, --datadir,
	--program-prefix, --program-suffix, and --program-transform-name.
    ./configure --enable-version does not automatically --enable-symlink.
    Installation directory for tf-lib now defaults to PREFIX/share instead of
	PREFIX/lib (configurable with --datadir).
    Fixed ./configure --enable-mailcheck=DIR.
ftime() now returns an empty string instead of an incorrect string if the time
    is out of range (in addition to printing an error message).
Time period values of 60s or larger are printed in h:mm[:ss.u] format.  This
    applies to %alert_time, %maildelay, %prompt_wait, %ptime, idle(), sidle(),
    and values derived from them (but not time() and mktime(), which are
    absolute time values).
The CONFAIL and CONNETFAIL hooks did not previously behave as documented.  The
    CONNETFAIL hook has been removed; the new ICONFAIL hook is called for a
    connection failure if there are more possible addresses to try, and the
    CONFAIL hook is called for a connection failure on the last address.  (If
    you had worked around the buggy behavior by duplicating CONFAIL and
    CONNETFAIL hooks, you will probably want to go back to using the CONFAIL
    hook only.)
Improved error checking for /repeat arguments.
Fixed inappropriate expansion of command lines (outside of macros) starting
    with /let, /set, /setenv, /test, /result, /return.
Fixed spurious error for "/break" without arguments at end of macro body.
Fixed: a macro with no other statements outside of an "/if (expr)" statement
    was incorrectly treated as an error, causing any macro that called it
    to abort.
Fixed: "/set var " (with trailing space) was setting var to blank instead
    of printing its value.
/listworlds and /listsockets ignore trailing space.
Fixed: /runtime incorrectly evaluated its return value.
Fixed: new -= operator added instead of subtracted.
Fixed crash if left side of new += -= *= /= operators was not assignable.
Fixed crash in strip_attr(). (50b5)
Fixed crash in /list -P.
Fixed class of crashes involving certain generated empty strings in macros:
    - attribute strings in echo(), substitute(), and decode_attr()
    - macro names
    - expression operands
    - etc.
Fixed bug in binding local address on some systems.
Will not crash if a bug in tf or library code supplies an invalid string in
    an error message.
Strengthened check for TERMCAP corruption by broken *csh.
Fixed moresize() and morepaused() with virtscreen=off (undocumented).

hiya,

My logging alias includes the hostname of the machine I'm running
tinyfugue on. There's currently no internal way of grabbing the
hostname that I've found. If there is one, could someone tell me?
else, ken, would you be willing to add some variable which just
reflects the current hostname?


Thanks!



adrian

Greetings!

  How would one stack commands to be sent to the mud through the prompt? 
I've used %; for macros, but some muds do not support command stacking 
and I find it useful to "queue up"  a few commands at times. For 
instance: I want to walk east and blind a mob before an ensuing attack, 
but I need to reduce the time between pressing enter following moving 
east and casting. A few google searches and a grep or two through my 
collected list mail haven't answered my question. Also, is there a way 
to search the entire archive?

Thanks for your time,
-justin

The easiest way is to prepend the command with /eval...then it "listens"
to the %;.

So..."/eval e %; c blind <MOBname>"

Of course I usually just type it into a text editor, copy the multiple
lines & paste into tf, when it's more than 2 lines.

HTH
Mike

The way I do it is I use the map.tf (mapping.tf?) and use the /dopath
macro in it.  I macro dopath to something shorter then

/dopath 20 e 10 w kill

However that has the obvious disadvantage wherein you can only use one
word per command.

The other way I do this is via this hook

/set parse 1
/def -mregexp -h"SEND ;" multicmd = \
	/set cmd %* %;\
    /if (parse) \
 	/while (cmd !~ "") \
	  	/if (regmatch("^([^;]*);?(.*)$$", {cmd})) \
	    	  /send %P1 %;\
	    	  /set cmd=%P2 %;\
	   	/else \
	    	  /send %{cmd} %;\
	    	  /set cmd "" %;\
	  	/endif %;\
	/done %;\
    /else \
	/send %{cmd} %;\
    /endif

e;kill mob;blind mob;chat hey I killed a mob;etc 

This was taken from the scripts of a very intelligent yet strangely unlikable
fellow on my mud named fjord.  It is similar to zmuds style of command
sequencing.

I use this hook:

/def -mregexp -p100 -h"send ([^%]{1};)+" stack_hook = \
         /eval $[replace(";", "%;", {*})]

That way I can stack with ; just like in tintin. If you are looking to 
stack by putting multiple lines into your input window, that's anothoner

Is it possible? I'm working with a group of MUD players on the MUD
Lusternia, and we have 'Project Z' which is a project to design a GUI
on Zmud, Mushclient, and by my idea, TF. It would be great if I could
get some input if this is possible, and if its not, then maybe some
alternatives that do the same. Lusternia is a heavily modified MUD,
Rapture base, its a wonderous game that is the best run I have ever
played. I mention this because it IS run on Rapture, and that perhaps
may provide a problem with any sort of command linking. Thanks in
advance for any input.

Daniel

PS Lusternia is related to Achaea, the first mud on Rapture by Iron
Realms entertainment.

I've thought about this a little after seeing the pretty  pictures on
the achaea forums.  If the main thing you want are gauges and other
visual status indicator, then you can probably trigger events to write
to a file/pipe/socket and have a seperate server that then takes that
input and writes to an X11 or other graphic library based app.

A gui for programming triggers and the like is also theoretically
possible.  You could even do it with a web interface.

Ah, indeed. I will look into that. Does that include the possibility
for having a graphical body display? Its nice in Lusternia because
Lusternia has a wounds system, and if I could set trigger paths to
modify the picture everytime wounds in a certain area got too large,
then I would be at greatest ease. Thanks for the ideas, and anymore
out there, dont be shy. Thanks!

Daniel

Sure.  Think about it this way.  You can flag body limb damage on the
status line without any more trouble than it takes to track state
(which is not easy, but that has to do with how raptue works and not
tf).  If you can do that, you could send the state changes out to a
seperate client to graphically represent a body.

If I were you, i'd focus on getting your system to work so it can mark
state in the new multiline status lines in 5.0b7.  If you get that
right, then doing it graphically won't be that bad, assuming you have
the programing skills for some graphics toolkit.  For the record, I
don't.  :P

It's definitely possible: http://crescendo.lyrical.net/

It sounds like you want to do more, though.

I'm having a slight problem getting 256 color support to work
properly, and would appreciate any help you could offer!

Software I Use:
    - OS: Debian Sarge
    - XTerm 4.3.0.1(200)
    - GNU Screen 4.00.02
    - TF 5.0 beta 7

Before this new beta I didn't use 256 colors.  I'd start Xterm, then
Screen, then TF.  I run TF in Screen so that I can have a few windows
in the same terminal running Vim or any number of different
applications.

After some reading and a healthy amount of trial and error I
discovered that XTerm and Screen, as packaged for Debian, do not
support 256 colors.  So I downloaded the sources and compiled them
myself with the appropriate options (--enable-256-color for xterm and
--enable--colors256 for screen).

I have a .Xdefaults file that redefines the standard 16 colors, making
them brighter.  The file follows:

===============================================
XTerm*color0:   #000000
XTerm*color1:   #B21818
XTerm*color2:   #18B218
XTerm*color3:   #B26818
XTerm*color4:   #1818B2
XTerm*color5:   #B218B2
XTerm*color6:   #18B2B2
XTerm*color7:   #B2B2B2
XTerm*color8:   #686868
XTerm*color9:   #FF5454
XTerm*color10:  #54FF54
XTerm*color11:  #FFFF54
XTerm*color12:  #5454FF
XTerm*color13:  #FF54FF
XTerm*color14:  #54FFFF
XTerm*color15:  #FFFFFF
===============================================

First I tried starting up XTerm and TF without Screen.  Everything
worked wonderfully.  The 16 colors I redefined in my .Xdefaults still
worked, and "/load testcolor.tf" printed out a very nice 256 color
display.

The problem arises when Screen enters the equation.

I have a simple .screenrc file to which I added the lines listed in
"/help 256colors".  The file follows:

===============================================
# set the caption bar to always be present, and its string
caption always "%3n %t"

# set the default scrollback buffer size for each window
defscrollback 10000

# disable the startup message (copyright)
startup_message off

# keybindings
bindkey -k k1 select 0
bindkey -k k2 select 1
bindkey -k k3 select 2
bindkey -k k4 select 3
bindkey -k k5 select 4
bindkey -k k6 select 5
bindkey -k k7 select 6
bindkey -k k8 select 7
bindkey -k k9 other
bindkey -k k; focus
bindkey -k F1 prev
bindkey -k F2 next

terminfo xterm Co=256
termcap  xterm Co=256
termcap  xterm AF=\E[38;5;%dm
terminfo xterm AF=\E[38;5;%p1%dm
termcap  xterm AB=\E[48;5;%dm
terminfo xterm AB=\E[48;5;%p1%dm
===============================================

Now I started TF inside of Screen inside of XTerm.  "/load
testcolor.tf" still prints out that nice display, however my 16 color
definitions in .Xdefaults have no effect.  The basic 16 colors are all
darker now as they were before I changed them.

I removed the last 6 lines from my .screenrc file and then started TF
inside of Screen inside of XTerm again.  The 16 colors now appear
brighter again as listed in my .Xdefaults.  However, "/load
testcolor.tf" doesn't display that nice 256 color output, it only uses
the standard 16 colors.

I'm not sure what to do to remedy this.  Does anyone have any ideas?

Thanks so much!

Ben Bettin

Thanks for the suggestion!

I gave that a shot, but still got the same results.  I did notice
something interesting though that I didn't notice before however.

If I run "/load testcolor.tf" in just XTerm/TF (.Xdefaults colors work
and 256 color works), and compare that with the output of running
"/load testcolor.tf" in XTerm/Screen/TF (.Xdefaults colors DO NOT work
and 256 color works)...the output is the same.  I see the IDENTICAL
colors on that chart, including the Basic/Bright colors.  The text
from the mud, however, is NOT the same in terms of color.

This tells me that the .Xdefaults settings ARE working properly, but
either Screen or TF are doing something that ignores them as they
interpret text coming from the mud.  I've got a feeling the issue lies
in those 6 lines added to my .screenrc, but I'm not sure what.

Anyone else have any ideas?

Ben

It's so much easier to solve a problem when you're attempting to solve
the *CORRECT* problem.  :P

Looking through "man screen" I found the following:

attrcolor b ".I"
Use bright colors for bold text.  Most terminal emulators do this already.

I simply added that line to my .screenrc, and everything works great. 
I didn't need to monkey with $TERM or anything else.  I'm not sure why
screen isn't falling in line with everything else, but at least it
works!

Ok.... that blew right over my head about the GUI thing and the
coding. I'm not a coder... yet. I plan on being one soon, and so I'm
looking for places to get experience. Anyway, I'll look into
Crescendo. Thanks!

I've got a large number of triggers and it produces a noticeable slowdown 
in test scrolling when 20-30 lines come through at once (as seen by 
toggling "borg" off and on). I'm looking for tips on what the "fastest" 
way to set up a trigger is, and am also wondering if there are any 
internal performance counters available that can tell me which trigger 
lines are being called the most and the average execution time for the 
pattern matching. Is using the "-E" option for conditional execution 
faster than checking the condition after pattern matching? Logically I 
would think yes but maybe not? So far my efforts at "timing" the 
differences with/without "borg" have proven fruitless. Timing the prompts 
gives very little difference, but I can visually see the screen lag.

As for debugging, the "mecho" and "secho" options are very helpful, but 
often hard to use when mecho is set to all, especially for deeply nested 
macros. I know I can set a log for this, but is there anyway to have it 
only put to this file rather than the screen, so you can test in the 
client and evaluate the output somewhere else?

This would be an improvement, except that it broke previous behavior.

In previous versions to get a color prompt I had embeded ansi codes into the
text ie...

/prompt ^[[36mBugHunter^[[0m >

Now in beta 7 I get the escape code in the prompt and not the color. How
should I make the prompt colored now? The help for '/prompt' is brief and does
not give any examples.

Thank you,

This probably isn't the ideal way to do it, but I added this little bit of 
code to force the text the prompt hook is called with to have the ansi 
codes pre-interpreted. I'm not quite sure I'm using the String type 
correctly. There seems to be some reference counting taking place but I'm 
not sure which ones need to be used, so this may have a memory leak.
It also may not work on all compilers with that declaration where it is.

The strange thing is that all the other "prompt" code paths seem to do 
this anyway, just somehow the test_prompt was either forgotten or left 
alone for a purpose (perhaps because it is potentially a partial line?)

I have written a .tf script particularly for IronRealms games (Achaea, Aetolia, Lusternia, Imperian, etc.)
that deals with speedwalking (similar to map.tf but with some extra features to support riding, tumbling,
swimming, etc and some workarounds for dealing the games limiting the number of movements per second.).

Recently I added a feature that records the relative directional coordinates x,y,z (and in/out).

I'm wondering if anyone has any code / ideas that would help me create a semi graphical map in ansi
that actively displays the movement of the player within the world. This would be a very useful tool,
making the navigation of a complex map more visually interactive and enjoyable.

To clarify my goal: I'm trying to use /visual mode to show a small map of possible paths surrounding
the current location. I already have a script to record the possible exits for each room (stored as a
variable named by its coordinate).

Well, for starters you'd want to keep track of the min/max of your x and y 
coordinates so you can have a boundary to BEGIN mapping from. Then you'd 
just find the upper left corner and "walk" through the coordinates from 
left to right for however far you want, building a string formatted 
however you want, then echo the string. If you are looking to create a map 
that has "paths" between the rooms, you would probably have to build 
both the "current row" and the next row underneath for any north-south 
paths. If you need to deal with one-way exits, you would have to do some 
re-parsing to reformat the middle rows.

Shouldn't be too difficult, just attack the problem in small pieces.

is there a clock variable in TF that counts time with milisecond precision?

There's a time() function.  See "/help time()".

Recently I had to reinstall my system. I'm using the same .tfrc I have 
been using for a while but there are two changes in the behaviour I'm 
experiencing. I'm using TinyFugue version 5.0 beta 6 on in Terminal on 
Mac OS X 10.3.9.

1) As text scrolls off the top of the window I can no longer use the 
Terminal scroll bar to scroll back to see that text. It scrolls off the 
edge of the top.

2) When I use the up arrow to get to the previous command I entered it 
leaves the cursor at the beginning of the command line instead of the 
end. I'd prefer it were at the end.

As I said this is not the way tf was reacting before. Any ideas?

Thanks,
David

Here are the commans that I added to my .tfrc when I upgraded to versoin 5 
so that the cursor remains at the end of the line instead of the begining:

/def key_up = /dokey_recallb
/def key_down = /dokey_recallf

    I wrote something to verify afflictions I was getting by checking
for the attack before curing an affliction, an example would be
this...

Ryntha viciously stabs a gladiator's trident into you.
Hmmmm. Why is everything so difficult to figure out?

   So to check to see if the affliction is an illusion, I wrote this...

/def -p2 -t'* viciously stabs * into you.' randomstabbing=/set
allowvenom=$[allowvenom + 1]
/def -p1 -mglob -t'Hmmmm. Why is everything so difficult to figure
out?' aconite=/if (allowvenom > 1) /set aconite=1%;/set
allowvenom=$[allowvenom - 1]%;/else /echo *************
ILLUSION!!!*************%;/endif
Naturally, when aconite is set to one it applies the cure, I've looked
over it time and time again, and it should work, but what I've been
getting follows,

Ryntha viciously stabs a gladiator's trident into you.
************* ILLUSION!!!*************
Hmmmm. Why is everything so difficult to figure out?

    Then when I check the variable, allow venom is indeed
allowvenom=1, so I can't see what could possibly be causing this, any
tips would be appreciated.  Thanks in Advance.

Perhaps the check you mean is allowvenom >= 1 not >1 ?

Try if allowvenom >= 1

Also, I suggest just using a flax, not a counter, and reset the flag at
each prompt trigger. It works for me.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

Not sure if this is a worthwhile addition, but I've found in several 
instances I need to do what I believe zmud calls "stateful" triggers, 
where you have to receive certain lines within a number of lines after a 
particular line. While TF can manage this with a set of timers, I thought 
it would be easier on macro writers if there was an additional type of 
macro execution limiter that basically allowed you to *check* a macro, not 
necessarily match, a limited number of times. Such macros would be useless 
in 99% of all situations, but very useful (IMO) when you do need them. One 
would be used as such:

Replace this:

/def -i -F -mregexp -t"^(.*) shivers and suffers\\." mob_poison = \
         /if ({P1} =~ _mob_name) \
                 /def -i -F -1 -mglob -t"*" mob_poison_death = \
                         /if ({*} =~ "%{_mob_name} has been slain!") \
                                 /combat_end%%; \
                                 get all corpse%%; \
                         /endif%; \
         /endif

With:

/def -i -F -mregexp -t"^(.*) shivers and suffers\\." mob_poison = \
         /if ({P1} =~ _mob_name) \
                 /def -i -F -N1 -msubstr "%{_mob_name} has been slain!") \
                          /combat_end%%; \
                          get all corpse%; \
         /endif

That's one of the very few examples that I have of it, but I'm sure there 
are people who use checks in "-E" for states etc. The main idea here is 
that if the macro is not executed very often, it is faster overall to 
define it only when you need it, and to make eliminating it seamless.

I'm not sure if anyone will find this useful, but I've attached a patch 
that implements this by adding a "-Nx" option to the /def command. Enjoy!

Unlike TF 4, TF 5 does its own scrolling, with the pageup/pagedown
keys (and others; see /help scrolling).  However, TF's scrolling is
incompatible with built-in terminal scrolling, so your terminal's
scrollbar won't work.  Also, OS X Terminal by default does not send
pageup/pagedown keys to TF; so you'll have to use shift-pageup and
shift-pagedown, or redefine how Terminal handles those keys in Terminal /
Window Settings / Keyboard.

As someone already mentioned,

    /def key_up = /dokey_recallb
    /def key_down = /dokey_recallf

I find it a bit annoying myself, so maybe I'll change the default behavior
in the next release.

And I love it the way that it is.  If I hit control-P I get the 
previous line with the cursor at the end, and if I hit up-arrow I get 
the previous line with the cursor at the start.  So I get to choose 
which end is more convenient.

Just installed 5.0b7 (upgrading from 4.0s1) and noticed something.

The redefinitin of ^B and ^F to move character-by-character instead of 
word-by-word.

I can see why this is done, a lot of people do emacs-style keys and expect it.

But I actually prefer the old word-by-word method. I know it's available 
with meta-B and meta-F, but that's a hassle for me when I'm typing a long 
entry and have to go back and fix a word.

I know I can manually reset the keys with /bind, and I've done so, tested 
it, and it worked.

HOWEVER.

I added the manual re-bindings to my .tfrc file - and it ignored them. Just 
went straight ahead and overwrote them with the character-by-character 
bindings.

So, I ask: How can I automate a return of this setting to the way I want it 
to be?

Thanks.

It sounds to me like you have some other keybinding loading after you
put your definition into your ~/.tfrc file.

Did you add your definition to the beginning of the file or the end?

Okay, the problem appears to have fixed itself.

What I changed: Put the key-bindings in a separate .tf file and have it
/load'ed as the last line of the .tfrc file.

Still don't know why it was doing that in the first place. It would have
been nice to see it offered as a well-documented standard single-command
option instead of having to hunt up how to re-bind them and all, too.

Looking at the growl web page, use the 'growlnotify' extra (a command
line tool for sending notifications to growl) in combination with
normal scripting.  You should be able to construct a trigger action
that calls growlnotify with arguments.

I've not tried though.

Lets siimplify this to:

How do I pass inputs from the terminal output window to a command.
How do I pass the worldname to the command.
How do I get around that =8C% DEF -t: glob error: ':' after '}' can never
match=B9 error, or better yet, pass input that filters out that : symbol (for
neatness)?

I know how this could be done in softcode, being a MUSH owner, however I=B9m
not all that up on tf scripting.
An example I=B9m hoping tf is like is thus:

&ATTRIB-NAME me=3D^* has paged you =8C*=B9: You were paged by %0, and the message
is %1.

I=B9ve tried this, but it comes out bizarrely.  I think the number system is
whacked, since it took me ages to get any sort of sensible message, and it
went:

First {*} was %1
Second {*} was %3

What happened to %2?  Or.... Is this expecte behaviour, as it seems pretty
crummy to be true.

Thanks in advance.

If you can give an example here=B9s a little assistance for you.

<Name> pages you: <message>
Long distance to <My Character>: <Player> <message>
MAIL: You have a new message from <Player>.
Watch> <Player>(<Player Number>) has connected.
Watch> <Player>(<Player Number>) has disconnected.

Those are the strings I=B9m trying to capture.  What I=B9d like to be able to
pass to the console is:
<player>, <message> and <world name>

=B3If I can get those basics, I think I can fathom out the rest, just about.

I would use /sys, thusly:

Here's a basic example way to do it:
/def -p1 -mregexp -t'([a-zA-Z]+) pages you: (.*)' do_send_page = /sh
growlnotify 555-1212 %P1 pages you with the message %P2 from world
${world_name}
All of that would be on a single line. What it does is open up a shell,
and issue the command "growlnotify 555-1212 JohnBoy pages you with the
message BlahBlahBlah from world NameOfMUD". You can definitely figure it
out from there.

Hello everyone, I'm pretty new to tinyfugue and am having trouble
loading scripts and settings with the /load command.

I input: /load ~kate/tf/healingsystem.tf   and various other /load commands
And the result: % /Users/kate/tf/healingsystem.tf, line 1: load:
Invalid command. Aborting.

This happens every time. I realise the first line of my file needs to
be a / or ;; and I've tried all that, asked around, and got nowhere.
It's probably really simple, but perhaps you tf junkies might be able
to help me out?

Many thanks in advance!
Kate

Why does the first line need to be a /.

I have tons of scripts that I load depending upon what character that
I'm playing, and I don't have a / as the first line.

What happens if you take that line out of the script?

Shell scripting is different than writing scripts for tf.

In shell scripting the first line is necessary to set the shell that
the subesquent commands are going to use to execute.  In tf, there is
no such requirement, unless you are invoking a shell.  In that case, if
it isn't defined, it uses your environmental default.

I think you're reading the error wrong. All lines in a tf script (macro)
file must be valid tf commands, but this should be obvious. A ';;' is a
comment, which is valid and a '/' is the start of a tf command, which is
valid. And, simply hitting the enter key is also valid. So, possible lines
in a tf script are: blank lines, comments, or tf commands. Anything else
will generate an error, no matter where it is in the file. 

The error you're seeing is simply telling you that the first line is not a
valid line in tf, not that the first line must have a '/', that is, it
could be a comment ';;' or a blank (I have many that start with blank
lines).

Maybe it will help to paste in the first few lines of the file?

Thanks a  lot everyone. Here are the first few lines of the file, as requested. 

;;---------------ABLAZE-----------

/def  -mregexp -t"The raging fire about your skin goes out."
Ablazetrig1 =/set Ablaze 0
/def  -mregexp -t"Flames lick around you - you are on fire!"
Ablazetrig2  = /set Ablaze 1
/def  -mregexp -t"summons up an evil tide of unholy power which
engulfs you" Ablazetrig3 = /set Ablaze 1

For the record, it starts with the comment, not a blank line. Any
further help would be really appreciated!

Thanks again,
Kate

Your problems are simply syntax rather than anything else.

These lines that you wrote,  are they split as they show in the quoted
text or are they one long line?

If they are split, you need to add a forward slash (\) to the end of
the /def's to continue it to the next line.

Like this:

;;---------------ABLAZE-----------
 
/def  -mregexp -t"The raging fire about your skin goes out." \
Ablazetrig1 =/set Ablaze 0
/def  -mregexp -t"Flames lick around you - you are on fire!" \
Ablazetrig2  = /set Ablaze 1
/def  -mregexp -t"summons up an evil tide of unholy power which \
engulfs you" Ablazetrig3 = /set Ablaze 1

After you add the slashes it should work.
Also, for me, it's easier to read scripts when it's split into sections
with white space, which doesn't affect the code at all other than for
readability.

Here's a couple of my own def's that I currently use to show you the
difference:

/def -mregexp -t"You see exits leading (.*)." exts = \
        /set xts=%P1
        
/def -mregexp -t"You see a single exit leading (.*)." sexts = \
        /set xts=%P1

Again, thanks for the help. I've added the forward slashes on the end
of all the lines that seem to be line-breaked, so to speak, but I'm
still getting the same error messages. It's a huge file of settings so
it's probable I've slipped up somewhere, but I have scoured it many
times over.

Thanks for all the tips and help. Perhaps I'm just way out of my depth here...

Kate

You said that you put forward slashes (/) at the end of each line that is 
line-breaked. You should be putting backslashes (\) at the end of each 
line.

I've only ever used TF in linux, so that's the perspective I'm basing
my next comments on.

When you get the error message, it will tell you what line of the file
the error is in.

If you use vim, all you need to do to get to that line numer is issue
the command ":<line number>"  so if the file is named blaze, and the
error is encounterd on line 157, to get to that line quickly after
opening the blaze file in vim is to type: :157

Then the error should be somewhere in either that line or the
line/function above it.

The error is still on line one, and if line one of my file isn't legal
I'm a dutchman.
I've tried -everything-

I am still at a total loss as to what the problem is, and how I go
about fixing it- even with all your help. I really am keen on getting
into using tf, but at this rate, who knows. Heh.

Thanks anyway guys,
Kate

Is your file a text file?  As opposed to say an rtf file or a Word 
file.  It needs to be text.

What editor are you using to create the file?  Maybe it's a unicode file
or has a unicode "BOF" indicator on the first line.  TinyFugue will
probably have a problem reading these.

Regards,
Henry

Hi Kate,
I think I know what the problem is, and Tim is close. If you're on a 
Windows machine, you need windows line-endings. If you're on a unix 
machine, then you need the unix line endings. There are 2 characters 
that can signal the end of a line...carriage return, and line feed. 
Windows uses CR, unix uses LF, and Macs uses CRLF.

See if you have a text editor that does the line translations (some 
zip/archivers can do it for you as well).

HTH
Mike

I've asked something about this before, but didn't get any good leads
last time.  My goal is to log not only the prompts, but what the
triggers/etc are trying to send as well.  Any suggestions?

TextEdit has a Convert to Plain Text menu option somewhere which looks like
it does the trick.

Hey all,

I'd like to know if there's a generic combination of options in 
tinyfugue that will make tf not trigger a monitor event unless there's 
actual worldly activity (I am using tf with screen's "monitor" feature so 
things like mail notifications and even the clock are unwanted, and I've 
had some odd results with disabling the clock, where it for some reason 
would still update every minute.

Alternatively, is there an option where tf can issue a "bell" on any 
world-activity.  (this is actually less preferable since it would also 
trigger when TF is in the foreground, as opposed to the screen answer 
which would be silent if TF was the current window).

I want to take the process ID returned from /repeat and put it into a 
variable.  I haven't been able to figure out how to use a return value, 
other than in an /if.  For instance:

	/eval /set procID /repeat -2 i /echo tuna

doesn't work.  I also tried:

	/eval /set procID $(/echo /repeat -2 i /echo tuna)

which also doesn't work, plus I felt like I was really getting off 
track.  Since you can use a return value in an if statement, I figure 
that makes it an expression, so I tried:

	/eval /set procID $[/repeat -2 i /echo tuna]		and
	/eval /set procID $[/eval /repeat -2 i /echo tuna]

which both failed.  Any ideas?

Make one that will have blinking ansi.  Not have a text mouse in full 
screen mode.

Or better yet have a 3rd party ansi screen emulator that can work full 
screen or window
mode.  Are any of these in the plans by the people that been compiling 
the ones for windows already ?

I'm still using a verson that is around 4+ years old cause there is just 
issuesw ith the 5.x in windows
that makes it undesirable.

   I've been trying to run mpg123 in the background from tinyfugue for
the last couple  days and have had some bad luck with it.  Not sure if
there is a way to make it run in the background from tinyfugue, but I
did try doing like, /sys mpg123 mymp3.mp3 &, and that came up with
some sort of syntax error, running the same command in my terminal I
came up with no errors on the very same command, so any help would be
appreciated, thanks.

That works great, thanks!

Thanks. This works in some contexts and not others, probably due to 
something I am doing wrong.

This is how I do it.  It has the unfortunate side effect of echoing any
text from your program into your mud window.  I use that side effect to
write a mapper that displays info about what it is doing in my mud
window.  I'm sure there's a simple way around it like replacing /echo
with something else.

/quote -0 /echo !mpeg123 file.mpg

My mud sends the following (taken from the client with %emulation=debug):

--------8<--------------------------------------------
^M^@^[[32mInside the Dark tower^[[37m^M
^[[32m^[[0;37mObvious exit: down.^[[1;36m^[[37m^M
^[[36mThere is a GO board here.^[[37m^M
--------8<--------------------------------------------

then a prompt, I type glance and get:

--------8<--------------------------------------------
^M^@^[[32mInside the Dark tower^[[37m^M
^[[32m^[[0;37mObvious exit: down.^[[1;36m^[[37m^M
^[[36mThere is a GO board here.^[[37m^M
--------8<--------------------------------------------
and a new prompt.

With tf v4.0 stable1 this mostly works fine.
Both the "There is a GO board here." and the "Inside the Dark tower"
lines are in a bright colour as well as the prompt and the text being
input, just like I wanted and just like plain telnet works.

In the 5.0b7 version, not a single character is in a bright colour, neither when
%emulation is "ansi_attr" nor when it is set to "raw".
The first bright line after a connection is in a bright colour, but
after that most bright lines are not so bright.

The version I'm using is:
% TinyFugue version 5.0 beta 7.
% Copyright (C) 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 Ken Keys (hawkeye@tcp.com).
% Built for Linux #2 SMP Wed Apr 14 23:04:13 EST 2004 2.4.25-1-686-smp

Its being tested on:
Linux gamegirl 2.4.25-1-686-smp #2 SMP Wed Apr 14 23:04:13 EST 2004 i686 GNU/Linux


I'm running in non-visual mode, started with "tf -vf". Running in visual
mode doesn't change this though. %lp is initially set to off, but it
turns itself on when the first prompt arrives.

Regards,
/Sebastian

When tf connects to my mud, the following happens:

S->C: IAC WILL SEND-EOR
S->C: prompt (without EOR)
C->S: IAC DO SEND-EOR
S->C: IAC EOR

TF will moan about this not being a prompt-terminated world after it
has received the first prompt...

It looks like this when running tf with %lp=off, %telopt=on:

% Trying to connect to (unnamed1): 130.239.18.149 2001.
% Connected to (unnamed1).
% recv: IAC WILL SEND-EOR
% sent: IAC DO SEND-EOR
% recv: IAC WILL COMPRESS2
% sent: IAC DO COMPRESS2
<lots of text deleted>
to look around or enter your character's name.

% recv: IAC EOR
% This looks like an unterminated-prompt world, so I'm redefining it as one.
    You should explicitly set the type with the -T"prompt" option of /addworld.
% addworld: Redefined world (unnamed1)
% recv: IAC SB COMPRESS2 IAC SE
By what name shall I call you (3-10 letters, no spaces):


(looking at the server, I see that the prompt line is sent before the IAC EOR line).

The version is 5.0 beta 7, but 4.0 stable 1 has the same behavior.

I don't see how else the server should do this and still be compatible
with buggy clients (except adding a timer and wait a short while before
sending the prompt...), so I assume TF should be slightly slower at
declaring this an unterminated-prompt world.

/Sebastian

Yeah, this is tf's fault.  It's trying to be helpful by automatically
detecting an unterminated prompt world, but it should consider the fact
that SEND-EOR has been enabled as evidence that this is NOT such a world.
I'll make it so in the next release.

In the meantime, you can avoid the problem by defining the world in tf
with an explicit type, e.g.:

    /addworld -T"eor" dumii 130.239.18.149 2001

To disable the clock, make sure you use the standard "/clock off"
or "/status_rm @clock" (to prevent redrawing altogether), rather than
setting %clock_format to blank (which will cause tf to redraw a blank
field once a minute).

Why not just use /sh mpg123 mymp3.mp3 &...seems to work fine here in 
both v4 and v5.

A main difference between /sys and /sh is that /sh actually attaches 
a terminal. Some programs like/require that.

I just started using TF.  I am running Ubuntu Linux on an iMac.  When I
edit the conf file I am using:
/def key_f12 =kipup
but when I hit the f12 key (after I loaded the conf file) it gives me:
[[24~ and I get something similar for all the other fkeys no matter what
I do.  I tried using a different terminal, same thing.  Anyone know
whats wrong?

You are missing a '-i'

It should be /def -i key_f12 =kipup

That worked! Thanks a lot, if I can figure this program out I can
finally stop using the horrid gnome-mud.  Do you know of a place that
lists all the names of the keys on the keyboard, for keybindings?

I'm stumped again.  I did what you said earlier about using /bind *hite
the key* =kipup, it worked when done inside TF.  But when I copy that
string and paste it to .tfrc then load, it doesnt.

Copy and paste will in most cases not work, because it does copy what is 
shown on the screen and not the one character that it should be, try to 
open .tfrc in your favorite editor and type it in there.

Hint: in most Unixes you can use ^v (CTRL-v) to escape the special 
meaning of a key. So to bind F12 to something try:

/bind ^v*F12-key*=whatever

Is there a library or set of scripts floating around anywhere that I
can use for handling arrays?

There are a couple floating around, here's what I use:

http://webhome.beanalby.net/viewcvs/*checkout*/tf/array.tf

I stole it from someone else a while ago and added a little to it.

I've been searching the web for code snippets and the such to give me an

those?

Example are good, but it's extra good if you can find a site or ask a 
friend for tf code for YOUR mud.  Sometimes even with knowing how TF 
works, looking at a random trig doesn't make it obvious what it's 
supposed to do.  If the code is written to interact with stuff you're 
familiar with, it'll be more likely to make sense.

FWIW, I have some triggers for BatMUD on my site:
http://home.beanalby.net:88/viewcvs/tf

"beanos.tfrc" is a good starting point, it's the main file that I load 
when TF starts up.  Lites.tf and macros.tf tend to have smaller, simpler 
trigs, which could be good for starting with.

Here's an example of an ugly bot system I wrote in TF (using Java &  
PostgreSQL for step persistance).

hiya,

is there a simple way to echo the prompt in the input /and/
the foreground window? i'd like to see it in both if its possible
without just /echo'ing in my prompt trigger.

thanks!

I'm trying to use tf_read and tf_write to write to stdin and stdout of the
output of an external program.

I can start the program like this:
	read_handle=tfopen("bash</mynamedpipe", "p")
and open a handle to the /mynamedpipe file.

This lets me do things like tf_write(fifo_handle, "ls") and then
tf_read(fifo_handle, line). (I'm just using bash and ls as an example)

My problem is that when there are no more lines of output available, tf_read
blocks. Therefore tf hangs in the above example when I have read all the 
files
that ls lists.

Is there a way to detect whether there is enough data for tf_read to return
before I call it? If not, is there another method I can use to have control 
over the stdin and
stdout of a program?

I'm using the Debian package of beta 6.

Thanks for any help.

Instead of using both tfread and tfwrite do this.

/quote -0 /echo !myprogram

>From that point on, all stdout will be piped directly to your tf window,
without any need to use tf_read, which blocks.  Then use tfwrite in
hooks or macros to write to your named pipe, and your external program
can deal with reading from that pipe in its own way.

Of course I may be making some assumptions as to your intentions.

Hi all!

I want to decode the Ansi color codes from a tf decoded string, but I
don't know the way how I could do it. A little example:

/test xx:=decode_attr("@{Cblue}xx")%; \
/test yy:=decode_ansi({xx})

I thought yy value would be "\033[34mxx", but it is only "xx".
Could anybody help me?

All the best,
Adrienn

I don't know if this is any help, but:
  /test xx:=decode_attr("@{Cblue}xx")%;
  /test yy:=encode_ansi({xx})
  /echo %{yy}
prints: "[[34mxx[[m" for me.

If you want to see the escape codes, then you could do:
  /test xx:=decode_attr("@{Cblue}xx")%;
  /test yy:=encode_ansi({xx})
  /test zz:=textencode({yy})
  /echo %{zz}

Hi!

I've been working on my server's telnet & socket handling and noticed that
it never closed the zlib streams before closing the socket, thus causing
MCCP-using clients to miss the last few sent bytes. When fixing that
tf (5.0 beta7 running on debian testing) started to loop when quiting.

I've only taken a short peek at what happened with the debugger, but
perhaps it is enough to find the cause?

The final message is processed over and over in handle_socket_input's
do loop. The inflate method has returned Z_STREAM_END once and is not
called again, but perhaps the problem is that it has already received
more data after the zlib-stream's end?

I'll leave a test server open at orcus.mine.nu 2003 for a while if
anyone wants to try to figure out why this happens and how to fix it.
(just login with guest, press return until you are in and then type
quit to experience the bug).

Regards,
/Sebastian

Hello,

I would like to ask for help about this thing:

/def -q -mregexp -t'^xy sleeps.' Do1 = sleep
/def -q -mregexp -t'^xy wakes up.' Do2 = wake

This is intented to sleep/wake with the leader.
This works fine when I fill xy with the correct name.
But it is difficult to /undef /def every time the leader changes.
Is there any way I can use a variable in this pattern?

Like /set leader = mylaeder
/def -q -mregexp -t'^%leader sleeps.' Do1 = sleep
This apparently doesnt work.

What is the correct way?

Thanks for you help, N.

Try something like this:

/def -q -mregexp -t'^([A-z]+) sleeps\\.$' Do1 = \
 	/if ({P1} =~ leader) \
 		sleep%; \
 	/endif

/def -q -mregexp -t'^([A-z]+) wakes up\\.$' Do1 = \
 	/if ({P1} =~ leader) \
 		wake%; \
 	/endif

The problem is that the trigger is defined with the value of the 
variable that is set at the moment the /def is executed.

What you want is:

/def -q -mregexp -t'^([A-Za-z]+) sleeps.' Do1 = \
	/if ( {P1} = {leader} ) \
		sleep%;
	/endif


After that you can set your %{leader} at any time and the trigger will 
react on the new leader.

Greetings
 Ralf

Anyone who plays DR still around here? I have this old school DR login
script in perl that was posted/sent to me a long time ago and now it
doesn't work any longer. My perl-fu is seriously lacking, so some
assistance would be fantastic. I'll attach the script here for
reference/archiving purposes. Thanks. --Gabe

ok, i've finally gotten most of what i want to do in tinyfugue figured
out, and i'm one step away from making the switch...

terminal.app seems to refuse to send key_nkp# when i use the
numberpad. also, it catches key_pgup and key_pgdn, so i can't use them
for what i want (/dokey_page)

i tried using X11's term, and that works very nicely. however, it's
text is too small, and thus unusable (i can't seem to find any option
to change the font size...)

anyway, if anyone knows how to get these apps to behave, or has a
recommendation for another mac os x app to use, it would be very
appreciated.

I'm not much of a Mac user, but I use xterm daily. I run Solaris. Here I
can do 'xterm -fn 8x16' to get the 8x16 font. Also, if I keep CTRL pressed
and right-click in the xterm, I get a menu where I can switch font size
somewhat.

    The subject should speak for itself, I'd like to know if anyone
has done it, or if it's even possible.  I'm aware of how to get
tinyfugue variables out into the environment, but not how to pull them
back into tinyfugue and access them just like normal tinyfugue
variables.  If anyone has done it, or knows how an example of some
kind would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

I have no idea, if there is any built-in method, but you can always try:

/test myshell:=$(/quote -S -decho !echo \$SHELL)

Hmmm. Interesting.

I've never delved into this much, but I do know that /quote can source its 
output from the output of a shell command... perhaps that's the route you 
want to go.

/eval /set blah $(/sys echo $HOME)
/expr %blah

It is not perfect, but it is sufficient for simple one line environment
variables.

still doesn't work, sadly.

for another test, i have 
/set name=nobody

and i want to test this... if i do 
/eval /echo $[name]
it returns
nobody

if i do
/eval /echo $[name =~ nobody]
it returns
0

for
/eval /echo $[name == nobody]
it returns
1

woo! but then i check
/eval /echo $[name == nofdisgkjfld]
and it returns
1

the same with /eval /echo $[name = fjdskalg]


so yeah, being unable to test variables severely hinders my ability to
write useful scripts...

== is numeric comparison, not string comparison.  Read /help
expressions.  Again.

If having an unquoted "name" on the left side refers to the variable
"name", why would an unquoted "nobody" on the right side not refer to
the variable "nobody"?  Put it in quotes to make a literal string.

     /eval /echo $[name =~ "nobody"]
     1
     /eval /echo $[name =~ "aiee"]
     0

rawr, finally figured it out....

i had certainly tried using quotations, as in the first example, but i
had also used quotions in my /set

glad to get that fixed.

By default, Terminal's keypad always acts like normal digit/punctuation
keys.  But if you turn on "strict vt100 keypad behavior" under Terminal |
Window Settings | Emulation, and /set keypad=on in tf, Terminal's keypad
will generate sequences that tf recognizes as nkp codes.

By default, Terminal.app traps PageUp and PageDown keys itself and does
not send them to the application.  It does however send Shift-PageUp and
Shift-PageDown to the application, so you can use these to scroll in tf
running inside Terminal.  You can also tell Terminal to send the unshifted
keys to tf by redefining them in Terminal | Window Settings | Keyboard.

    Just toying around with crescendo a bit, and wondering if anyone
has used it and been able to get their status line to work, AND get
replies from tells/msgs/etc put into the the tell box.  If so maybe
I'm doing something wrong.  Feel free to inform me if this is just a
waste of time.  Also considering the gnome tf wrapper, so any good/bad
experiences with that would be helpful as well.  Thank you.

Wow.. I tried crescendo YEARS ago... it looked nifty.. but in the end 
wasn't really usable.. I even tried my own tf frontend 
(http://gtinyfugue.sourceforge.net/) which I spent all of 2 days working 
on... I think I eventually decided that one either sticks with tf in a 
terminal, or make a graphical client from scratch.. trying to embed tf 
insie a graphical client just seemed too much trouble.. still, this was 
back in tf v4 - maybe v5 plays nicer..

is there any way to implement an array or priority queue, or would i
have to implement this using strings?

what i want to do is have a function /heal <affliction> that i could
pass aflictions and it would heal them based on priority. it would be
really neat :)

I had the same question a while back. Here's the answer:

;========================================================================
; get_array() / get_2array()
;
; Retrieves data from a virtual array.
; USAGE:
; x := get_array("array_name", index)
; x := get_2array("array_name", index, index2)
;
; x             : Value returned.
; "array_name"  : Name of the array.
; index         : Element.
; index2        : Element of index (get_2array only).
;========================================================================
/def get_array = /RETURN _array_%1_%2

/def get_2array = \
   /RETURN _array_%1_%2_%3

;========================================================================

This script would be much more useful if it went a step further and did 
some housekeeping on the arrays that open up the possibilities of things 
like foreach(). Keeping track of keys, number of items etc would be the 
first step!

I wrote this script.  It dont do house keeping cause its suppose to be 
fast as possible.  If you want to
do special things that you're doing thne just code it using the arrays.  
Keeping track of the number of
elements is the job of the coder :)

I'm working on LPmud and I found /getfile_LP buggy... it
doesn't work at all. Very often it couldn't catch ':Exit from ed'
And file wasn't 'downloaded' at all.

I have rewritten this macro, and it works well even with log_timestamp
Enjoy!

;========================================================================
; size_array()
;
; Returns the total size of an array created with put_array()/put_2array().
; USAGE:
; x := size_array("array_name")
;
; x            : Total number of elements found in the array.
; "array_name" : Name of the array you want to get the size of.
;========================================================================
/def size_array = \
  /let size_ 0 %;\
  /def size_array2 = \
    /test ++size_ %;\
  /quote -S /test size_array2("`"/listvar -mglob -s _array_%1_*"") %;\
  /undef size_array2 %;\
  /RETURN size_


I created this figuring some people may want a quick way to count how 
many elements they have in
their array.  I have added a whole set of stack functions as well.  But 
its still being tested.  Also made more
time functions whole bunch of stuff but want to make sure I have it all 
tested before I sent the whole mylib.tf here
its around 1700 lines now.

Hello folks. I have a question regarding unteriminating prompt worlds.
To begin with, here is a quote of the first paragraph from /help
prompts:

Most LP muds, Diku muds, telnetd, and some other types of servers send
unterminated prompts, that is, prompts that do not end with newline or
any other special character.  Normally, TF will not display text until a
newline is received, so you may not see the prompt until after you press
return.  But if the %{lp} flag is on, TF will attempt to separate these
prompts from normal text and display them correctly.


As the quote says, TF isn't displaying the prompt in the output window
until I press enter. However, with visual mode off, the prompt will come
up when I press return. My goal is to have the prompt show up whenever I
receive a prompt from a server, and not only when I press return.

I tried the trick that was mentioned under /help prompts regarding the
%{lp} flag and /addlp. I didn't seem to work, and I could still clearly
see where the prompt was getting gagged at. All I did was define my
world with /addlp instead of /addworld and made sure the %{lp} flag was
on, but that didn't seem to do the trick. I was wondering if I missed
something, or if I have to do something else to get this to work.
Thanks in advance.

I believe Ryan is referring to IRE muds (Lusternia, Achaea, Imperian,
Aetolia) in particular, if that helps anybody who is familiar with
this problem.

Hello,

	I am trying to color some text that I recieve 
 from the server. It seems pretty simple and from what
 I read about triggers and def in the tf documentation
 leads me to believe I am doing this correctly, yet 
 I must not be, as it is not working. Here is the 
 scripting data that is not working:

--snip--

# Coloring of house and clan channels
/def color_candidates = /echo -aCbgmagenta,Cblack [Candidates] %*
/def color_cyrene = /echo -aCbgmagenta,Cblack [Cyrene] %*
/def -t"^\(Candidates\): (.*)" candidates_house_match
= /color_candidates %P1
/def -t"^\(Cyrene\): (.*)" cyrene_match = /color_cyrene %P1

--snip--

	note: these lines are all one line each.

	What am I missing?
	I am looking forward to your helpful response(s).

Thanks,
Chris

Try this:

/def -F -PhCbgmagenta,Cblack -mregexp -t"\[Candidates\]"

This will only highlight the [Candidates] part as it is a partial
highlight.  If you want the whole line to be highlighted you would want
this:

/def -F -ahCbgmagenta,Cblack -mregexp -t"\[Candidates\]"

I'm trying to setup a set a trigger that matches string with enemy1 or 
enemy2
and then return the return _only_ the enemy value, I dont want the whole 
string before..
I can continue the process..

working out the syntax but can't seem to get it right, been trying for 
hours..

my setup:
/eval /def -mregexp -t"$[%enemy1|%enemy2]{*} is dead" enemying =/echo RIP 
%{P1}


current issues:
it only triggers on enemy2 - want it to trigger on both enemy1 and enemy2
%{P1} is not returning anything
{*} the wildcard is not working

Example var:
/set enemy1 Bob

Example string:
Cutthroat Bob The Ruthless is dead

Example output:
RIP Bob

Issues that I've worked around:
been trying with /eval, and without.. but if I run without I can't seem to 
get it to run
the variable it just runs text..

Hope it make sence to someone...

/set enemy1 Bob
/set enemy2 Bobo
/eval /def -mregexp -t"([%enemy1|%enemy2]){.*} is dead" enemying =/echo RIP 
%%{1}

problems:
It fires on everything, but atleast I worked out the wildcard issue, 
somebit...

more strings I want it to match:
Cutthroat Bobo The Ruthless is dead
Bobo The Ruthless is dead
Cuttthroat Bobo is dead

result:
RIP Bobo

it could not fire on Bob..

by the way how do I reply to my own thread, or to someone's else?

I've been trying to cut down on the spam in a very spammy room, using this:

/def -p2000000 -F -mregexp -t'fires a caspian arrow' fireignore = /substitute

This, unfortunately, still leaves a blank space where the line once was. Is there a better way to do this, or at 
least a way to cut out the entire line AND the blank space where the line should be?

Try this:

/def -ag -F -mregexp -t'fires a caspian arrow' fireignore

The -ag gives the trigger the gag attribute.

That cannot really work [] encloses lists of characters (or character 
classes) in regular expressions not strings.

What you want is:

/eval /def -mregexp -t"(%{enemy1}|%{enemy2}).* is dead" enemying =/echo RIP %{P1}

Ever since I switched distros to Ubuntu I've been having this problem;
the keypad is wonky. When I press nkp1-3 and 8-9 it turns up fine,
like so:

% The key "nkp8" is undefined; you may use "/def key_nkp8 = <commands>" to 
    define it.  See "/help keys".                     

But nkp4-7 gives me this:

% The key "f5" is undefined; you may use "/def key_f5 = <commands>" to define 
    it.  See "/help keys".                                                     
% The key "f6" is undefined; you may use "/def key_f6 = <commands>" to define 
    it.  See "/help keys".                                                     
% The key "f7" is undefined; you may use "/def key_f7 = <commands>" to define 
    it.  See "/help keys".                                                     
% The key "f9" is undefined; you may use "/def key_f9 = <commands>" to define 
    it.  See "/help keys".

xev reports different keycodes and -syms for the actual f5 and the
actual nkp4 that's turning up as f5, but if I bind f5 both buttons are
bound. I've tried this in xterm, aterm and gnome-terminal without any
success. Tried with TERM set to vt100, rxvt, xterm and screen on all
of 'em, with no success. Tried the VT220 option in xterm that seems to
have worked for someone else having this problem, but with no success.
Tried with keypad on and off, numlock on and off, no success.

I need nkp4 to be nkp4 and f5 to be f5... Anyone have any idea what
might be going on and/or how to fix it?





And, in case it's of any help, here's some xev output:


The key that's supposed to be nkp4:

I Would like a IF that looks like this:

IF ({dead} = "bob" AND {corpse} = "bob" AND {here} = "1"...)  <do thing>

I know I can stack it with IF's, but it would build up and get very very 
messy to edit..
Didn't find anything under examples, and I tried searching the forum, but no 
luck..

Help?

How about:

/if ({dead} =~ "bob" & {corpse} =~ bob & {here} == 1) \
	/do_thing%;\
/endif


See  /help expression  for more details about the expressions you can
use in an /if or similar statement.

Hello,

	Can anyone think of why -ag seems to not
 be working in my triggers? They work, everything
 does what it is supposed to do, but the text that
 I wish to gag gets printed back on the screen.

Thanks,
Chris

Hello again, thanks for the help earlier, can't figure our how to respond to
my own threads, anyway got more trouble:

I have a variable thats:
/def myvar = 5, 1, 3, 6, 8, 7

#example trigger
/def poorest = /if ({myvar}..(i'm lost))

myvar works as a array and I need todo:
'grep' the lowest number, return its value and continue process..

on another function I need to remove _only_ the number
that was returned from the the myvar..

Might be able to figure that out, but need to grep/locate the number somehow

Help, again? ^^

No, this is a macro definition. You can set variables with /set or /let

TF has no built-in array types. There are several packages that offer
array functionality though. See the online archives at
http://www.tcp.com/pipermail/tinyfugue/ for references.

You can do list operations using /car, /cdr and similar functions.
See  /help lisp  for more..


Hope this helps,
Johan

It works now. Think I tried setting the variable

the server showed, heh.

Heyas,

Can I get tf to tab complete from the mud. I can use it to tab complete tf
commands but nothing from the mud.

I hope this makes sense.

TF doesn't know all the commands that your mud uses. But if you store
these words in the %{completion_list} variable, then you can these in
TAB completion as well.

See  /help complete  for more details.

I write a script to complete paths for wizard on LP muds so mayby you 
can use it to make your own module.

The script is located at:

Friends,

I seem to have uncovered a mostly reproducible bug in /LIMIT in tf
5.0b7.  My apologies if it's been reported, but I checked the list
archives and it seems to have not.

Steps to reproduce:

* Create a new world connection to a simple text-echoing server or
something of the like.
* Generate lines containing "foo", "bar" and "baz", or some other
three random strings of your choice.  These strings must not appear
anywhere else in the buffer.
* After a /LIMIT *bar*, /LIMIT *foo* will work fine, but /LIMIT *baz* will fail.
* The general case I suspect (but have not done enough testing to be
certain of) is that a new limit will fail whenever all of its matching
lines fall under the final matching line of the currently active
limit.

Thanks for the report, it was good enough for me to reproduce the problem.
It will be fixed in the next release.

I have TF4.0 stable with the screen terminal and I've been using the numpad features fine with redhat,
but I switched to debian and I've been having trouble with the numpad.
It echos 1234 etc instead of the key codes for home, end, page up, etc.
I manually set my $TERM variable to screen, but I'm fooling something else up.
Can anyone help me out with this?

I forgot to mention in my last post that I'm using a new version of ncurses. I think I just have something misconfigured in my terminal or something. Maybe one of you terminal savvy debian users can help.

I'd like /quote to fire off a little under a second between
repetitions, but I can't figure out how to set ptime to anything less
than one second. I tried /set ptime=0.5 and the like, but that seems
to be the same as setting ptime to 0. Is there any way I can achieve
this?

Is it possible to play sounds in TF other than a simple beep? I'm 
talking instantaneous sounds, like warning beeps.

Thanks.

Yes, the method differs from platform to platform.

On Windows I hacked a /winexec method into tf so I didn't have to  
deal with the issues around /sys.  On Linux, you can use your choice  
of command line sound playing tools and simply /sys /your/sound/ 
command.  On the Mac, you can use /sys (I do it all the time with the  
command line 'say' command to have TF read triggered lines to me so I  
can listen to what's going on rather than monitor it visually), or  
you could hack it so use the Carbon or Cocoa API's to play the sound.

Hello,

Additionally, if you use a client like SecureCRT to connect to a server
running TinyFugue remotely you may be able to add even more client side
scripting. :-)

I used triggers in TinyFugue that would output a unique line, which in turn
was intercepted by a SecureCRT VBScript, which would then do stuff like
popup the window or play a sound. A bit roundabout, but it works...

Regards,

Peter.

This is based on UNIX experience:

It is best to have a sound-playing daemon (for example, esoundd) running 
and a connection to that from TF. Over that connection, provide the data 
of what you wish to play. This way you avoid the small, but irritating, 
delay which might occur when you start a process. On modern systems that 
delay is small but on older and slower computers it can be large enough 
to make the sound experience bad.

I use the 'esd' approach when I did this.

In my case (from memory):

1. Start esd as follows (asymed is an ALSA multiplexing device name):

  $ esd -nobeeps -as 2 -r 48000 -d asymed &

2. Load in pre-defined sound samples into esd:

  $ esdctl cache /usr/share/sounds/warning.wav
  etc

3. Check the sample works:

  $ esdctl play esdctl:/usr/share/sounds/warning.wav
  etc

4. Try is from inside TF:

  /sys esdctl play esdctl:/usr/share/sounds/warning.wav

5. Build appropriate triggers.


Note that it is possible to set up the ESPEAKER variable so you can
redirect sound over an ssh-redirected port to a local esd server.  In
this case, using the cached sample technique above avoids the lag+delay
while the sound is sent over the network (at the time it was dialup and
a few simultaneous triggers would lag out the link).

Cheers,

Mark

I have two /repeats, one going off ten seconds after the first which goes 
off every hour in two seperate /defs (the second one is actually set to go 
off every 70 seconds).  How do I go about coding it so that I can put both 
(or more) repeats into one def, but the second one will only go ten seconds 
after the first?

/repeat -10 1 /foo %; /repeat -10 1 /bar 

Is that what you're trying to do? This executes the second repeat "ten
seconds from now" and in 20 seconds executes /bar.

I think it should be like this:
/repeat -10 1 /foo %%; /repeat -10 1 /bar

I forgot to mention that both repeats are /sending something. So...

/def thingie = /send -w foo%; /repeat -w -01:00:00 1 /thingie
/def narf = /send -w bar%; /repeat -w -01:00:10 1 /narf

TinyFugue crashes when using backspace (or delete word, etc) on the
first line after resizing your screen. It seems TF forgets the cursor
position after a resize. It's fine when you hit Enter first.
This only happens with visual off (which is the mode I prefer).

Consider the following:

/def thingie = \
   /send foo %; \
   /repeat -10 1 /send bar %; \
   /repeat -01:00:00 1 /thingie

Does this what you want?

Ah ha!  Several people have reported this, but all have omitted the
crucial bit about it happening only after a window resize.  Now I
can reproduce it and fix it.

Exactly.  Now I just need to figure out how to gag the output, since I don't
need to see it.

Is there any chance you could elaborate on this for me?  It is something 
I've been thinking about attempting, thanks!

I can't get the substitution right..

Example:
/def -mregexp -t"Planting flowers (.+w) waters{| (happily)| (happily) (the 
rose)}" flowergarden_001 = \
        /set gardener %{P1} %; \
        /if (%{P2})
          /set mood %{P2} %; \
        /else \
          /set mood 0
        /endif %; \
        /if (%{P3}) \
          /set plant %{P3} %; \
        /else \
          /set plant 0
        /endif

/trigger Planting flowers Bob waters
/trigger Planting flowers Bob waters happily
/trigger Planting flowers Bob waters happily the rose

I want my substition to save

%P1 = Bob
%P2 = happily or 0
%P3 = the rose

Yet I can't I fail with the regexp, I wish there was some nice tutorials on 
TF..

Help?

This may not be the best regex for the job, but it seems to work:

/def -mregexp -t"Planting flowers (\w+) waters ?(\w+)? ?(the \w+)?"
flowergarden_001 = \
	/set gardener=%{P1} %; \
	/if ({P2} !~ "") \
		/set mood=%{P2} %; \
	/else \
		/set mood=0 %; \
	/endif %; \
	/if ({P3} !~ "") \
		/set plant=%{P3} %; \
	/else \
		/set plant=0 %; \
	/endif %; \
	/eval /echo gardener=%gardener  mood=%mood  plant=%plant


/trigger Planting flowers Bob waters
gardener=Bob  mood=0  plant=0

/trigger Planting flowers Bob waters happily
gardener=Bob  mood=happily  plant=0

/trigger Planting flowers Bob waters happily the rose
gardener=Bob  mood=happily  plant=the rose

/trigger Planting flowers Joe waters quietly the sunflower
gardener=Joe  mood=quietly  plant=the sunflower


Hope this helps.

Worked great, however why I need this is cause I try to link a two line 
trigger, I tried similar on next line
and I got this far:
/def -mregexp -t"(\w+) ?(\w+)? the leafs falls as (.*)" parry_test003 =
if I had ?(\w+)? in begining i got repeat errors

the first %P1 %P2 are the same as last ones, currently it works for:

waters happily the leafs falls as thunder storms... = triggers gives %P1 
waters and %2 happily
happily the leafs falls as thunder storms... = triggers gives %P1 happily
the leafs falls as thunder storms... = doesn't trigger

I tried with this aswell... moving the %P1 one step ahead, cause %P1 matches 
all
((\w+) (\w+) with|(\w+) with|with)
But then it doesn't give %P2 on second "|(\w+) with|" substitution
However it sets fine in the other pipes..

Hello,

As said, I use SecureCRT, which makes use of the Windows Scripting Host to
allow some simple scripting and triggering. I found the helpfile (ActiveX
Scripting section) to be very helpful with examples and a reference for the
SecureCRT specific objects.

Basically, I created a new session that connects to my linux server and
specified a logon script to be used. (Session Options -> Connection -> Logon
Scripts)
The logon script loops until the session is disconnected, waiting for one of
several known strings to be displayed. It then plays a wav file based on
which string was seen.

I've put a copy of the script up here:
http://alpha.lemmen.net/Spul/TFE.20050822.001/abydos_sound.zip

And the small .net (1.1) utility I use to play the wav files here:
http://alpha.lemmen.net/Spul/TFE.20050822.001/PLN.Utils.PlayWav.zip

The script is pretty self explanatory if you want to change the strings and
wave files to be played. I suggest you play with it a bit and read the
helpfile for the objects used.

As to how to have TinyFugue generate the strings, you can use any method you
like. As long as it is displayed in the SecureCRT window, the script will
see it. The first three strings ('Ready to Fight', 'Full Health' and
'Finished Fight with') are generated by my combat and health tracker
scripts. The others are simply strings sent by the mud. (Or bash, for the
one about detached screens.)

You can do actual triggering with characters sent back to the server, as you
can see with Case 7, but I strongly suggest leaving as much intelligence as
possible in the nice world of TinyFugue and just using this as an audio
notification of events.

Let me know if you run into any trouble.

Regards,

Peter.

I'm going to be losing access to my linux box with TF on it.  Does
anyone have any ISP/servers that they know of that have TF available?

Type "/load testcolor.tf" to see all the available colors, then count the
squares, rows, and columns (starting with 0) in the color cubes to get the
values for r, g, and b.  For example, orange is in square 5, row 3, column 0,
so its name is rgb530.

I'll add labels to testcolor.tf in the next release to make it easier.

Is there a way to have a macro or trigger check to see if a file is currently loaded with /load or /require?

If I grab a prompt with a hook and attempt to redefine it with "/test 
prompt()", I always end up with an extra linefeed... I'm guessing it is a 
linefeed sent that normally would "conclude" the unterminated prompt line. 
Is there any effective way to suppress these without affecting anything 
else?

Maybe "/help loaded" will help.

I use tf on freeshell.org. I have the "just above free" account that 
was something like a token buck iirc. I think that I had found a 
version of tf already on their systems, but I have an old DEC Alpha 
running NetBSD at home, so I can upload binaries to my freeshell 
account, and have used that to get my freeshell setup on par with my 
home alpha setup.

Hi.

I'm having some troubles highligthing long lines (>80 chars). Assume I =
get

"The paperboy punches at you but your floating large stone shield swoops =
in and absorbs all of the blow."

Since this line is more than my aterm width (in chars) it is broken into

"The paperboy punches at you but your floating large stone shield swoops =
in and"
"absorbs all of the blow."

How do I highlight both of these lines? It's important to note that I =
could be figthing some other NPC with an either
shorter or longer name, and the line could therefore be broken at other =
places, for example at "in" and "all".

In my windows client (MUSHclient) I simply do the global pattern

The* *but your floating* *swoops in and absorbs all of the blow.

and the >entire< line is highlighted. I would like to be able to do =
something similiar in TinyFugue - is this possible?

I've tried setting %emulation (I think that's the variable name) to raw, =
I've tried wrap=3Doff, but nothing seems to help.

Kind Regards,
Jack.

I have something like that setup, here's how I do it.

 /def -Fp0 -aBCrgb520 -mglob -t'You kneel and begin praying to Lord
Dameron for the triumph of strength and the' dameronhl=3D\
/def -n1 -aBCrgb520 -mglob -t'will.' shrinehl

Basically everytime it sees the first part of the text I'd like to highligh=
t=20
it makes a oneshot trigger to read and highlight the next line. This is jus=
t=20
a basic example, but you get the idea.

quot;iso-8859-1&quot;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Hi.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I'm having some tro=

<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Since this line is more than my aterm width (in chars) it i=

ating large stone shield swoops in and&quot;<br>&gt;&quot;absorbs all of th=
e blow.&quot;
<br>&gt;<br>&gt;How do I highlight both of these lines? It's important to n=
ote that I could be figthing some other NPC with an either<br>&gt;shorter o=
r longer name, and the line could therefore be broken at other places, for =
example at &quot;in&quot; and &quot;all&quot;.
<br>&gt;<br>&gt;In my windows client (MUSHclient) I simply do the global pa=
ttern<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The* *but your floating* *swoops in and absorbs all of=
 the blow.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;and
the &gt;entire&lt; line is highlighted. I would like to be able to do
something similiar in TinyFugue - is this possible?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I've tri=
ed setting %emulation (I think that's the variable name) to raw, I've tried=
 wrap=3Doff, but nothing seems to help.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Kind Regards,<br>
&gt;Jack.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have something like that setup, here's how I do it.<br=

Basically everytime it sees the first part of the text I'd like to

I've noticed twice today that sometimes the pager will kick out the 
wrong part of history, show a negative number of lines, ie more -2, and 
tf freezes up completely. This usually happens when I've been looking 
through the built-in help and then switch worlds quickly. I just 
upgraded to 5.0 alpha 11. Uname -a for my system (unix shell on my isp) 
gives me: SunOS falcon 5.8 Generic_108528-21 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-5_10.

I also noticed that there is no kb-old.tf that's supposed to be 
abailable for backwards compatibility.

Ctrl-L also does not clear the screen, only the visual mode buffer.

Doing some checking, I do realize that is not the current version of tf, 
however that was the latest, and the only 5.0 version listed, when I 
connected to the ftp server the other day.

My questions are: How do I move the "Activity in world suchandsuch" off 
the status line? It's confusing when I'm multi-tasking and I see that 
there's activity, but don't know in which world it's in. Also, if there 
was more than one world with activity, the messages would overlap. For 
example, I'd have activity in world centralperk, but before that would 
clear, I'd get activity in world shadowmud, but it would display as 
activity in world shadowmudrk.

Also, how do I get a world to automatically disconnect when I log off of 
the world? I have to both logout/quit and do a /dc or exc -> or <- to 
move to the next world.

TIA,
Herb

I did so as I was composing the message. As I mentioned in my message, 
5.0 alpha 11 was the only 5.0 version I saw in the directory when I 
decided to upgrade initially. All of my questions are still valid, and 
the bugs are still there, although I have not attempted to replicate the 
pager bug.

Now that TF supports 256 colors, what terminal packages (other than 
xterm) also do the same? Or, is xterm "it"?

Someone else on the list previously posted that they thought one of the 
gnome terminals did. Since 5.0 beta 7 has been out since April, I 
thought enough folks have been using it that a range of terminals may 
have been tested with the new color option.

putty/pterm supports it and I believe KDE's konsole supports it too.

I am trying to get 256 colors to work on my mac.  Using the apple X11
and xterm, and 5.0b7 compiled with 256 color support, loading
testcolor.tf only shows colors for the basic and bright colors and X's
for the color cubes.

There is probably something obvious I am missing, but I haven't
stumbled on the right google search string.  Any suggestions?

Debian's xterm isn't compiled with 256 colour support, perhaps it is the
same for OSX?

mrxvt uses the 256 colors.  I haven't really played with it too much,
but the colors.tf (not sure if that's the correct name for the test
atm) comes up and shows the ranges correctly.

Though, I also use gentoo, and compiled it, so I'm not exactly sure if
the other distros use that flag by defaut in their binaries or not.

I'm using CVS version of Eterm (0.9.4) - it supports 256 colors.

putty does support it, but we had to tweak the colour codes we used somewhat
to get tf to output the same colour on both putty and xterm.

Hello.

I have written a little arrays lib.
I hope it will be useful.

Command /?array or /array_help will tell you how to use it.

Greetings,
Jacek Jakubik (volus)

    I'm writing a script that substitutes any word for another word from the server on the fly, (without having to write a long substitute/replace speil every time.)  I'd like to be able to figure out a way to also replace all text SENT that match the newly substituted words to their old ones. 

Eg. /subst randomword randomword2 substitution_entry
type:randomword2 SEND:randomword1

   I've tried doing it with hooks, but A. I can't seem to assign hooknames using place variables such as {P1} or %{1} like I could for triggers and such.  Even if I found a work around for that, I have other hooks that /send %*, so the result is it sends everything that matches both, twice.  Up until now I've had a complicated function that undef's everything, then redefines based on the context, but that's become massive and cumbersome to modify.  Any suggestions here would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Repeat seems to be glitching.  When I try '/repeat -2:00:00 1 /echo test' it shows up in /ps like this, 

 PID     NEXT T D WORLD       PTIME COUNT COMMAND
  189           2:00:00 r       1   @:q 

The echo never comes, and normally I can periodicly check /ps to see how much time I have left on various repeats, but it stays at 2:00:00 until the time is up, in which case it simply disappears without executing the command.  Has there been a change in /repeat I'm unaware of?

   PID     NEXT T D WORLD       PTIME COUNT COMMAND
     6   36.844 r             0:01:00     1 /anti_idle

   I have tried running the same /repeat command without any macro's, and recompiling tf, and I get the same result, so I'm guessing it's a bug, and might have something to do with the fact that it's running on 64bit arch.

FreeBSD insomnia.localnet.net 5.4-STABLE FreeBSD 5.4-STABLE #5: Thu Sep 15 15:24:53 CDT 2005     perlfu@insomnia.localnet.net:/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/INSOMNIA  amd64

   Might be wrong though, didn't notice the problem in 5.0 beta 6, but it's possible that I just didn't catch it.

I've run into this problem in two locations, though in slightly different
forms. TF 40a4 on Windows XP and 40s1 on Linux. It's not TF's fault, but I'm
hoping TF has a solution.

I was fine on my Windows machine until my roommate updated the router software.
Now if a connection doesn't have constant activity, like if someone doesn't
pose for five minutes, it lags up and I have to wait for it to unlag, which
usually takes several minutes.

On the Linux server, if the connection isn't kept constantly active, it dies
altogether.

A /repeat with @@ doesn't work to solve the problem. A /repeat with 'think' or
@pemit me= or something similar does, however it spams me something crazy.

TinyMUSH 3 is what I'm connecting to. It doesn't have a ping command like I
know some servers do.

So my questions are:

0) Can anyone tell me what's going on that's causing it?
1) Does anyone know a good fix for it that would solve the problem? 
2) Does anyone know a ping equivalent for TinyMUSH3 or some way to fake it?
3) Is there a way to get /gag to not mess up the /recall count?
4) Is there a way to not have /gagged text show up in logs?

I'm hoping someone has an answer to at least one of these. It would help me out
a lot.

Thanks.

-J Andrews

Hello all,

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
MY GOAL:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

To create a colored log of the display.  By that I mean what I
ACTUALLY see, not necessarily what the MUD sends me.  This would
include the removal of all gagged text, application of highlights,
etc.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
THE REASON:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

I enjoy combat oriented MUDs, for the most part I stick to Iron Realms
games (Lusternia in particular).  In order to debug my system properly
and maximize the amount I can learn from my logs, I'd like them to be
representative of what I see when playing.  The black & white plain
text logs the /log command provide just aren't cutting it.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
MY IMPLEMENTATION:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Gathering some initial ideas from this list I created a logging.tf
script.  This script provides macros that are run when I connect and
disconnect from the MUD.  It creates three logs; two that utilize the
built-in logging commands and one that's created by this script.

The "globallog" and "worldlog" are the ones that utilize the built-in
commands.  To the worldlog I've added a "SENT:" prefix to all the
commands I send (via a SEND hook), and to both the worldlog and
globallog I insert a copy of the prompt whenever it is received.

What I refer to as my "combatlog" is the colored log I'm most concerned wit=
h.

Throughout my system, EVERY trigger that's not a gag is set to
"fall-thru" and has a priority > 50.  My logging.tf script has a
trigger set to priority 50 that catches everhything (".*").  This
trigger then writes the captured text to a file, encoding it with the
ansi stuff ("/test tfwrite ({combatlog},encode_ansi({P0}))").

This implementation has worked great.  Attached to this email you will
find a copy of my logging.tf and the three logs created by it (briefly
logging into Lusternia and sending a few commands).  To view the
combatlog in ANSI color I execute the following command in my shell:
less -R <filename>

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
MY PROBLEM:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

While this implementation works, it's not very elegant and it's not
efficient at all.  Because every trigger is fall-thru, things get
unnecessarily checked repeatedly.  Also, I have to do some creative
(and dirty) tricks in other parts of my system to make things work
that normally wouldn't because the triggers are all fall-thru.=20
Basically, while logging is fantastic everything else is made more
difficult.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
MY QUESTION:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Is there ANY other way to create the ANSI logs that reflect what is
seen in the display?

I thought perhaps there would be a hook that would work in this
situation.  One that fires just before something is displayed (sent to
the foreground socket?).  I tried ACTIVITY and PREACTIVITY however
they only seem to work if the socket in question is in the background.

I would truly appreciate any thoughts and ideas.

Thank you!

Ben Bettin

P.s.  My collection of TF scripts, including the logging.tf that is
attached, are posted on my website in UNIX, DOS, and HTML formats.=20

Chamber of rituals.
A heavy door swings on strong hinges to seal this chamber's only exit during 
private meetings or secret rituals. The chamber is circular, its earthen walls 
covered by the same black marble that makes up the tower above. The room is 
illuminated by a combination of lanterns on the walls and large candles 
standing on the dais in the centre of the room. The dais is raised up by two 
stairs that surround the entire platform, as if two discs of decreasing size 
were placed on top of one another. Atop the dais is a table covered with a 
black cloth, upon which is a statuette. The bronze statuette depicts a twisted,
undefined mass of tentacles, arms and humanoid figures, the artist somehow 
fortunate enough to have survived a hunger attack of Gorgulu, the Devourer of 
Souls. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A sigil in the shape of a small, 
rectangular monolith is on the ground.

Chamber of rituals.
A heavy door swings on strong hinges to seal this chamber's only exit during 
private meetings or secret rituals. The chamber is circular, its earthen walls 
covered by the same black marble that makes up the tower above. The room is 
illuminated by a combination of lanterns on the walls and large candles 
standing on the dais in the centre of the room. The dais is raised up by two 
stairs that surround the entire platform, as if two discs of decreasing size 
were placed on top of one another. Atop the dais is a table covered with a 
black cloth, upon which is a statuette. The bronze statuette depicts a twisted,
undefined mass of tentacles, arms and humanoid figures, the artist somehow 
fortunate enough to have survived a hunger attack of Gorgulu, the Devourer of 
Souls. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A sigil in the shape of a small, 
rectangular monolith is on the ground.
You see a single exit leading northwest (open door).

You have played 840 games.

Goodbye for now!

For TF 5.0b7:

A more efficient method, albeit at a cost, is to: /set emulation=raw
That will log all ANSI escape sequences to your logs, but all your triggers will
have to be changed to match ANSI escape sequences in the trigger pattern
(tedious and very error prone, but it's the method I use).

To not log gagged lines, set those gagged lines to also have the L (nolog)
attribute in addition to the g (gag) attribute in the /def command.

Wave bye-bye to automatic hilites or partials in raw emulation mode, assuming
that in ansi_attr mode TF's hilites reinstitute the color before the highlight
to after the highlight like I suspect (I never tried it); that won't happen in
raw mode.  So in raw mode, use triggers that run the substitute() function, and
substitute each MUD line you want to highlight with the part of the triggered
line that you want highlighted substituted with ANSI color codes (use
encode_ansi(decode_attr(blah)) if you don't know the ANSI codes for each color),
but you'll have to keep track of the attributes/ANSI codes in the part of the
line before the highlight to reinstitute after the highlight yourself within
each trigger.

Or you could ask someone to provide a patch to 'convince' tinyfugue to
log without stripping attributes.

I'm looking at handle_socket_lines(), world_output() and save_to_log()
as likely candidates. Could someone conversant in tf-fu point me in
the right direction?

And I have the proof of concept mostly working:

My modified save_to_log() function does this:


static void save_to_log(History *hist, const conString *str)
{
    String *ts;

    if (wraplog) {
        /* ugly, but some people want it */
        const char *p = str->data;
        int i = 0, first = TRUE, len, remaining = str->len;
        do { /* must loop at least once, to handle empty string case */
            if (!first && wrapflag)
                for (i = wrapspace; i; i--) tfputc(' ', hist->logfile);
            len = wraplen(p, remaining, !first);
            tfnputs(p, len, hist->logfile);
            first = FALSE;
            p += len;
            remaining -= len;
        } while (remaining);
    } else {
        /* encode_ansi returns a new string */
        ts = encode_ansi(str, 1);
        tfputs(ts->data, hist->logfile);
        //Stringfree(ts);
    }
    tfflush(hist->logfile);
}

Uncommenting Stringfree(ts) causes it to crash. So, here's the question.
How do I deallocate the string created/returned by encode_ansi() ?

Ok. Here's a preliminary. It doesn't log the prompt, cause the way
I use /log doesn't include the prompt and I log it separately.
I haven't tested it for gags. It works for highlights.

Feedback welcome. Especially to do with me manually incrementing
ts->links just to get the damned Stringfree() to work.

SOMEBODY GIVE THIS MAN A COOKIE!!!

This patch works fantastic, perfect, EXACTLY what I (and I know many
others) have been looking for.

I loaded up TF without any scripts and did the following:

/log -g /path/to/my/log/globallog.log
/set ansi_log=on

And it just plain worked.  Everhything from the MUD was logged in
ansi, including all of my echos, highlights, rewrites, etc.  Adrian
says it logs everything -right- before it displayed...and it does!

Ken, I beg of you, please include this patch or some derivative of it
into the next release!

Adrian...THANK YOU!  :)

I am thankful for the tip on the logging of raw ANSI sequences, and I use it
with pride.  But...  And you can flame me if necessary, is there way to have
it log colours in rich text format?  The reason is because I do not use a
lot of command line tools, and prefer GUI editors and rich text is easier
for formatting for the web.  Alternatively, is there a tool or utility that
I can use to convert from RAW ANSI to HTML/RTF.  Cheers in advance.

I'm sure someone has/could write something to convert ANSI to HTML
quite easily in a Perl script. I might do something like this so
tinyfugue users like me can post these colour logs on a webpage for
others to gander at.

I've been testing this patch and it seems to be quite stable.
What do others think?

If somebody needs file to convert ANSI logs to HTML you can try my Perl 
script that can be found at
http://www.ingwar.eu.org/tf/download.php

Usage:
perl ansi_to_html.pl -i ansi_log_file -o html_log_file

Im waiting for any comments or problems.

I'm sure someone has/could write something to convert ANSI to HTML
quite easily in a Perl script. I might do something like this so
tinyfugue users like me can post these colour logs on a webpage for

 I'm sure someone has/could write something to convert ANSI to HTML

tinyfugue users like me can post these colour logs on a webpage for

I've been testing this patch and it seems to be quite stable.
What do others think?

I want to thank the people who had suggestions for my connection problem. The shell
account at least stays connected now. My Windows tf still has issues. Partly related
to when it's a background process, it doesn't update or keep the ping going.

But the main reason for this post is a time question. I'm using the Windows port for
tf40a4 on Windows XP. This happens every year (twice a year) and it just happened
early this morning. It decides to tell me it's an hour earlier than it is. In other
words, it anticipates the daylight savings time change. If I type /time, it tells me
it's October 5th, so it obviously isn't entirely confused about the day. It just
refuses to believe my system when it tells it it's 11am and decides it really means
10am.

My theory is this has something to do with the time/date that the port was made?

Is there any solution to this?

Thanks.

-J

I remembe a little while ago there was some conversation about ansi colors.  
What I want is a way to just log output to a file, and convert all the 
colours (fore and background) to HTML so I can make cut's of my roleplay 
(and what not).

There was something ansi-ish a little while ago, but I couldn't figure out 
how to run the software.  Any clues?  I'm on 4.0s1

Logedit is a real pain:
o /set emulation=raw
o /log file.txt
o <do action>
o /log off
o <download file>
o load LogEdit, Edit file, save as HTML
o upload HTML

I'm hoping there's something out there that'll help out the newbie.  I use 
screen (at it's default, I'm a newbie) and TF from that.
I've also been noticing with that set up that some mushes thing my screen 
width is 81 columns (which it is when I want 80).  Weirdness.  Hopefully 
someone out there will know way more then I do.

Uh, does HTML even support the concept of a background color in a per-line 
instance?

Sure it does - table rows and cell colour. :P

We've discussed this on the list a week or so ago.
I've got my local tinyfugue-5.0b7 patched to log raw ANSI without
having to set emulation=raw and thusly making triggering
a little painful. ;)

That's the conversation I was referring to, I think.  Someone posted a patch
I could add (not that it's my server to patch anything on) to a 5.0b7
version of TF (which I also don't have).  Surprise of surprises, it either
didn't work or I didn't use it very well because nothing worked.

In anycase, still looking.

Are you able to 'update' to tinyfugue-5.0b7? If you're running tf4.0
from some shell service then you may be able to compile and run
tf5.0b7 from your home directory. There's a /lot/ of new and useful
stuff in 5.0b7 and its very stable. :)

I was able to bind several functions to my keys, but at the end it
seems, that there are not enough keys left.

I managed to get alt+numpad_keys working. Good.

Where i completly failed: strg+f_keys.

the commandline in tf gives me a: [[11^ if i press strg+F1, i can't
find a way to bind strg+F1 to something. i don't know what i'm
missing.

Thanks for your help.

PS: Was someone able to activate the multimedia keys that can be found
on some keyboards in such a way, that they can be used for tinyfugue?
that would also be very helpful, but maybe should be discussed in
another thread.

Sorry for disturbing you, but i found the answer in the doc.

you have to use:

    /def -b'[[11^' = /echo testme

to bind something to strg+f1

sorry again.

I'm trying to get TF to work with an old TBBS mud called
Illusions, but it uses a legacy ansi interface which seems
to work fine in telnet, but gets messed up a bit in TF.

I tried the /telnet command instead of /connect and I
tried both visual mode on and off. I think the problem
has to do with line breaks. Basically I'm not getting
prompts back from the BBS, but instead, I get whatever
I type last echoed back to me on a new line. I'm sure
this is a newbie question, but I would appreciate it
if someone could point me in the right direction.

Thank you.

Hey guys, for some reason /bind [[A = n no longer binds my up arrow key to the north movement command, anyone have any idea why this is so?
Thanks,

short quesiton:  Is there any way to /status_add something and have it 
*overwrite* a field of the same name that may be present?  I know '-x' 
won't overwrite if present, but I want the opposite.

Alternatively, is there any way to detect whether a field of a given 
name is present?

Long question: Explaining my situation might bring abount an alternative 
solution.

My mud has services that players may accept from me: a, b, or c, which 
are mutually exclusive.  I have it set up to add info to the status bar 
when someone accepts: If John accepts service a, it adds a field called 
"service_john" to the status line that says "john: a".  When I enter the 
command to do service a, it does a /status_rm service_john.

Rarely (1% of the time), john instead decides to accept service b before 
I do service a. In this case, I want to change the text of the field 
"service_john" to "john: b" (getting rid of "John: a", since they're 
mutually exclusive).  My current method for this is always doing a 
/status_rm before /status_add, but this as the annoying effect of always 
printing "% STATUS_RM: service_john: no such field" when it's added.  If 
I could tell it to overwrite the field, or if I could detect if the 
field's present and only remove when it's there, then it'd solve the 
problem.

Thanks
Jason

The obvious question is...what have you changed between when it worked 
and when
it stopped?

how does tinyfugue set the source ip address?
I'm behind a firewall and would like to specify a
certain ip out of my block of static ips for use with tf / telnet.

Don't bother changing the status line. Just set the status line once and then
use the contents of the variable to change the display.

/status_add status_john

/set status_john=John A

/set status_john=John B

Each time you change the contents of the variable it will change the display
line. All you have to do is arrange the triggers to set the required value in
the variable.

You can also check the contents of the variable to see if you need to remove
the status_add

TF doesn't even know what the source IP address is. Your source IP will be
that of the interface you use to reach the target.

Unless the IP address you want to use is one assigned to your machine, setting
the source IP would not do you any good even if you could do it.

What firewall are you trying to get past? You will need to give some more
information. It is unusual to block out-bound connections unless the network
admins are wanting to make you use a proxy server.

That works for the situation of changing a to b, but it's not garunteed 
to have the appropriate name already on the line.  When to set the 
status line once?  'John' is one of 300 or so players who could accept 
at any time, constantly signing on & off.  The name of the variable is 
generated in the trig based on who accepts.  I can't really prime the 
status bar with "/status_add service_%{allPlayers}", so I still need 
some way of detecting whether it's already there or not.

> You can also check the contents of the variable to see if you need to remove

Ah, there's an idea: when I /status_rm, I can clear the contents of the 
variable.  So I can test the emptiness of the variable to know if it's 
on the status line.  That should work.

Thanks!
Jason

Perhaps I am not reading the help pages correctly, but I cannot find a way to
list *only* the second line *backwards* in the history.

While I can do "/recall 4-5" to list the 4th and 5th lines in history and
"/recall 1" to list the last line in the history, I wanted to grab the second
to last line in history.

I know I can do "/recall -B1 1" to get the last two lines, I then have the
problem of parsing out the line I want.

Has anyone else had this problem and solved it, or am I missing something in
the help entry?

Thanks in advance.

p.s. This requirement was inspired by the zmud 'linebefore1' and 'linebefore2'
functionality.

Then I think the best way to do it is to write a trigger on anything that
stores the line it has in linebefore1 in linebefore2 and then the current
line in linebefore1.

Try '/recall - -2'. The lone '-' lets the command know that '-2' is a
range and not an option.

Thank you Nathan. This works exactly as I wanted.

This syntax isn't immediately obvious from the help file. Perhaps Ken can add
this to the examples.

There MUST be some standard accept line that let's you know whether
they accepted or not.

If the line is something like: Joe accepts service b from you.

You'd set up a trigger something to the effect of:

/def -mglob -t"%1 accepts service %2 from you" svc_accepted =\
           /set stat_line_var ${%1 %2)

Not sure that the syntax is completely correct, but it's a dynamic type
of a setup based upon who accepts and what service.

When you perform the service, all you have to do is to clear the
variable.

Yes, detection has never been a problem.

The problem with that is if a whole party decides to accept the 
services, I could get the following input in the span of 3 seconds:

Alice accepts service a from you.
Bob accepts service b from you.
Charlie accepts service a from you.
John accepts service c from you.
Joe accepts service c from you.
Eugene accepts service a from you.

I'd want an entry for everyone of those, and each entry removed as I do 
it, as it'd help me keep track of who I've already done / who still 
needs done / what they need done.  Putting it all in a single 
%stat_line_var variable means I'd have to go parsing through that string 
manually, which would be a pain.

Hello, I have an annoying thing happening to my status line, more often
than not, really.  The white space in the status line will get overwritten
with either output from the mud or text that I have entered at the mud
prompt, here are examples of what it should look like, and what happens.
Oh, this is on TF40s1

This is what it is supposed to look like:

_H_622_/660__S_290_/351__E_320_/324__C_979___X_3159___________________bat____


And this is what happens to it

 H:2660_0660_51/351_E351_/32324_1324_X:51590_>ca58383___

As you can see, the information is still there, and the colorizing that
I have done to the status line stays, but extra garbage creeps in.
Anybody have any ideas on how to fix it?  If I redraw the screen, it fixes
itself until it happens again.

Hi.

I had the same problem, when my variable isize was 1. I fixed it with:

/set isize=2 (or higher)

As mentioned in a pervious message by someone else, I too had the
problem when I set isize=1.  I was able to fix the problem by setting
two different variables.

/set cleardone=on
enables clearing of the input window when return/enter is pressed.

/set clearfull=on
enables clearing of the input window when it is full of input.

I've been banging my head against the wall.. Can't figure out whats wrong 
with this prompt or how to fix it:

prompt_catch =

It picks most output up, but when I enter combat it dont:

Doesnt work:

(2 hits) You shoot a runner alien very hard a couple times, which completely 
cripples it!


() is coloured around "beaten-up"
beaten-up is aswell coloured

When I just try it colourless the prompt works.. Not idea how to test the 
prompt with colour, or how to fix it.. But I suspect it has something to do 
with the colour's of (beaten-up)

Works fine all other times, except combat...

greetings

my problem - i want to find a target, aim in several directions and
hope to find it. store the direction as variable and go on with other
stuff.

the idea that i had in mind was something like (with obvious
abreviations):

/set directions n s w e
/while (%directions{1} !~ "") \
  aim %target %directions{1} %; /shift %; /done

if that works, it would already be a great help, but the %diretions{1}
thing makes problems. and i can't figure out how to solve it.

then i would go on with something like:

/def aimfortarget = \
  /while (%directions{1} !~ "") \
    /set search_dir = %directions{1} %; \
    aim %target %search_dir %; \
    /shift %; \
  /done

Then i'd store the direction, where i found the target:

/def -mregexp -t"sometext" storesearchdir = \
  /set %targetdir %search_dir

Suppose i find the target, get the trigger, then move on with
searching, i hope/think that the direction will only be stored for the
right direction where i found the target, as the trigger won't be
executed later on.

First: Suggestions how to do it?

Second: Improvements? Opinions?

Thanks for your help,
Xorot

Well, it would work something like:

/def aimfortarget = \
	/while ({#}) \
		/set search_dir %{1} %; \
		aim %{target} %{search_dir} %; \
		/shift %; \
	/done

When you launch /aimfortarget with argument %{directions}
Then aimfortarget will scan all 'words' which are in direction variable,
so, in this case - directions :)

dumb question:

what if i want to fix the direction for all times? say, i always want
to check into all directions and not give them as argument.

/set all_directions n s w e nw ne sw se up down in out

how would you implement that in the macro?

thanks for your answer,
xorot

I believe this is not working because you are trying to match anything,
then a space, then the opening parenthesis. The color codes come between
the space and the parenthesis, so the regex does not match.

Here's how I would do it:

In your current regex, swap
T:(\[\]|\[(.*) \((.*)\)\])
for
T:\[([^\]]*)\]

Then inside the def, add something like:
/let enemy_status=strip_attr({P7}) %; \
/if ( regmatch('(.*) \((.*)\)', {enemy_status}) ) \
  /set enemy=%{P1} %; \
  /set enemy_health=%{P2} %; \
/else \
  /set enemy=None %; \
/endif %; \

I haven't tested this, so some of it may not work, but hopefully the
general idea is there.

HTH

I'm having major issues getting started with tinyfugue, I installed it with

any server for some reason
 for example
I'll type
 /connect newworlds-rpg.com <http://newworlds-rpg.com> 4002
and get the error
 (hostname for (unnamedX) in progress
failed: newworlds-rpg.com <http://newworlds-rpg.com>: no address associated
with name.
 I don't get it, I'm supplynig the address as an argument?
 I've tried using
/addworld nw newworlds-rpg.com <http://newworlds-rpg.com> 4002
 and then
/world nw
 but aquire the same error, thinking it may be a local dns issue, I tried
with the ip which gave me the same results.
 Any help please?

How do I test a prompt or trigger in colour?

Having trouble to know what pattern I could use if a output has colour in 
the line, and I want to troubleshoot the problem without having to be on the 
mud.

The error message already says it: it cannot resolve the name. You 
should just try the IP (207.235.90.9).

When I try to input accented or other international characters
I get some garbage in my input area. Is this not supported or
is there a setting I need to adjust?

I guess, it's just because TF thinks, that '<http://newworlds-rpg.com>' 
is some kind of port or adress, or so,
All you have to do is

/connect newwordls-rpg.com 4004

Yeah, my email client gave the addition of the <http://newworlds-rpg.com>',
 I uninstalled and installed an older version of tf and it resolved the
issue.
and the use of the previously used /connect
newworlds-rpg.com<http://newworlds-rpg.com>4002 worked
Thanks for the asstiance

Thanks.

your part with:

> /def aimfortarget = \
> 	/while ({#}) \
> 		/set search_dir %{1} %; \
> 		aim %{target} %{search_dir} %; \
> 		/shift %; \
> 	/done

works fine.

In order to go on with the problem i tried:

  /aimfortarget n s e w nw

with the target sitting s.

If aiming works, you get a line, here simply called "triggerline".
Therefor i wanted to store the right diretion with:

/def -p1 -mregexp -t"triggerline" store_search_direction = \
  /eval /set arch_direction %search_dir

no matter what i do (amount of arguments), at the end always the last
direction argument for /aimfortarget is stored as arch_direction - in
this example nw.

i doubt that the commands are faster send as received, but it could
be. another possibility: does search_dir become a global variable in
while, or does it become global only when /while is finished?

thanks for your help

ps: i'd also like to discuss other approaches, if you have some

I want to do a repeat time, but I want to vary the occurence of the repeat
between 1 and 2 minutes.
 How can I grab a random time between the two of them and then place it in =
a
variable to pass to /repeat?
 Any help would be appreciated.

You can repeat once and call the function again with a new random value,
e.g.

  /def action = /echo action%;/repeat -$[rand(60,120)] 1 /action

Here $[rand(60,120)] calculates a random value between 60 and 120sec.
Replace the  /echo action  by whatever you want to be executed.

Johan

Thanks for the help,
 when using

 for example,
I get
% def: Redefined macro action
 Then when typing
/action
 I get,

  Which means?

Try replacing 'action' with a more original name, so it doesn't replace
one of your existing macros.

You missed the closing bracket ] in this statement, try:
   /def new_action = /echo yawn%; /repeat -$[rand(40,67)] 1 /new_action

You're missing a ]. It should be
/def action = /echo yawn%; /repeat -$[rand(40,67)] 1 /action

Are you sure there's no other macro definition for /action? That would
explain the 'redefined' message.

The expression syntax error means, that insine $[] was looking for
operator after the function call but instead found 1, because a ] was
missing.

I am new to tinyfugue, and i'm in the process of writing some scripts
to aid me while playing on a specific MUD. I have some experience with
other scripting languages such as perl but i'm just starting to learn
tinyfugue's scripting language. I have been reading the documentation
but I can't seem to find a way around this problem.

Does tinyfugue's scripting language have a way of referencing
variables? i'm thinking of something similar to perl's behavior where:

$foo = "bar";
$$foo = "hello world";

which would alter the $foo variable (by referencing it).

I am trying to cut down on repeated code in my tinyfugue scripts by
building functions and calling them with parameters, in doing so I
would like to use variable name references. Rather than posting my
entire code (which is currently pretty ugly) I have created a simpler
version which demonstrates the problem i'm having:

/set colors_blue=good
/def key_shift_f9 =  /let color=blue %;   /if (colors_%color =~
"good") /set colors_%color=bad %; /elseif (colors_%color =~ "bad")
/set colors_%color=good

I am trying to toggle a value of %colors_blue, by referencing the
value of %color, using %colors_%color.

This gives me the following error:
% key_shift_f9: condition syntax error: expected operator or ')', found '%'.
% key_shift_f9: macro syntax error: expected end of statement, found '%'.

Could someone give me an example of how to accomplish this, if it is possible?

Thanks,
Matthew

Here is an example that works, though it is a bit of a hack due to the
extra variable involved. There is probably a better way to do this.

/set colors_blue=good

/def key_shift_f9 = \
  /let color=blue %; \
; define temp as a local variable
  /let temp=None %; \
; set temp to the value of colors_blue
  /eval /test temp := colors_%color %; \
  /if (temp =~ "good") \
    /eval /echo Setting colors_%color to bad %; \
    /let temp=bad %; \
  /elseif (temp =~ "bad") \
    /eval /echo Setting colors_%color to good %; \
    /let temp=good %; \
  /endif %; \
; set colors_blue to the new value of temp
  /eval /test colors_%color := temp %; \

ok here's the deal.  I'm trying to make a series of commands that will 
repeat 5 seconds from each other.  But the problem I'm running into is, when 
I run the macros, the repeat time for all the macros executes, and then each 
of the macros executes one after the other with no time in between.
How can I alleviate this problem?
If an example is necessary to clarify what I mean, I can post the sort of 
thing I'm trying to do in another message.
Thanks for any help you might be able to give.
-Cary

I have to guess because you haven't provided an example, but I think I
know what you mean.  If I've misinterpreted you, disregard the main
part of this message.

You're doing something like

  /repeat -5 cmd1
  /repeat -5 cmd2
  /repeat -5 cmd3

in sequence, aren't you?

This does what it says on the box.  It repeats cmd1 every five
seconds, cmd2 every five seconds, and cmd3 every five seconds, but
that's not what you want.

This seems to be a common point of confusion.  /repeat does _not_ mean
something like "delay so-and-so-many seconds and then continue with
this sequence".  It means "do this -- asynchronously -- in the future
relative to the current time".  So you are saying "do X five seconds
=66rom now, do Y five seconds from now, and do Z five seconds from now",
so they will _all_ happen five seconds from now.

You could do something like

  /def run_cmd1 =3D cmd1%; /repeat -5 1 /run_cmd2
  /def run_cmd2 =3D cmd2%; /repeat -5 1 /run_cmd3
  /def run_cmd3 =3D cmd3%; /repeat -5 1 /run_cmd1

if you wanted them to be run cyclically with five seconds between
commands.  Without more information I can't be sure whether that's
what you want though.

<snip>

Quoting /help .tfrc:
---
At startup, TF attempts to load and execute commands from the 	personal
config file named "~/.tfrc", "~/tfrc", "./.tfrc" or "./tfrc".  This
file can contain any commands you want executed automatically when TF
starts.
---

So, that's where you should put it. Also, when you're macro set gets
more complicated you should consider dividing it into more files. Then
just use /load ~/tf/file.tf to load them. That way you can also save
triggers that are not needed all the time.

/help contains a wealth of information. You should read it :)

OK I'm a kinda new to Tinyfugue, and I'm not quite sure how to do this...
I have a list of potions, each listing the type, number, and amount of
sips left in that potion. What I want to do is have Tinyfugue pick out
the number of  a specific type of potion that has the lowest number of
sips whenever it sees that specific list. I've included a sample of
the list below to show what I mean. I want to be able to do this to
all 20 types of potions I have.

"clear potion7602"      Type: Health Restoration           Sips: 50.
"clear potion9216"      Type: Health Restoration           Sips: 32
"clear potion9328"      Type: Mana Restoration             Sips: 47.
"clear potion20637"     Type: Health Restoration           Sips: 21.
"clear potion23091"     Type: Speed                        Sips: 44.
"clear potion36174"     Type: Antidote                     Sips: 22.
"clear potion39380"     Type: Cure                         Sips: 28.
"clear potion50120"     Type: Allheale                     Sips: 32.

Thanks in advance!

Hello,

     It seems that no matter what I do, the keypad / * and - keys
always do whatever I have bound to key_f2 and I was wondering if I
could get a point in the right direction. Is there something I need to
do in the shell (though these keys work fine via bash)? Do I need to
load some different keymap within TF?

     Thanks in advance for any help,

Korf

P.S. I am running in bash under gentoo 2005.1

Here's a way to do it using Python, though you could implement it
using only tf.


/require textutil.tf

/def get_lowest_sips = \
;   turn on the trigger
    /set getting_lowest_sips=1 %; \
;   clear the potions file
    /echo %| /writefile potions_list.txt %; \
;   the command used to list the potions
;   edit this
    list_potions %; \
;   wait two seconds then stop the trigger and display output
    /repeat -2 1 /unset getting_lowest_sips %; \
    /repeat -2 1 /quote -S /echo -p !python sips.py


/def -E{getting_lowest_sips} -mregexp -t'"clear potion([0-9]+)"\s+Type: (.*?)\s+Sips: ([0-9]+)\.' getting_pot_info = \
    /eval /echo %{P1},%{P2},%{P3} %| /writefile -a potions_list.txt



# sips.py

#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys

try:
    f = open('potions_list.txt')
    # strip newlines and blank lines
    lines = [line.strip('\n').split(',') for line in f.readlines() if line != '\n']
    # convert values to integers
    lines = [ [int(line[0]), line[1], int(line[2])] for line in lines]
    # convert to a dictionary
    lines = [dict(zip(['num', 'name', 'sips'], line)) for line in lines]
    f.close()
except:
    print 'Cannot open file'
    sys.exit()

lowest_sip = {}

for i in lines:
    name = i['name']
    if name not in lowest_sip.keys():
        lowest_sip[name] = {}
        lowest_sip[name]['sips'] = i['sips']
        lowest_sip[name]['num'] = i['num']
    elif i['sips'] < lowest_sip[name]['sips']:
        lowest_sip[name]['sips'] = i['sips']
        lowest_sip[name]['num'] = i['num']

for name, vals in lowest_sip.items():
    print '@{n}Type:@{BCgreen}', name, ' '*(20-len(name)),
    print '@{n}Number:@{BCred}', vals['num'], ' '*(10-len(str(vals['num']))),
    print '@{n}Sips:@{BCblue}', vals['sips']



And some sample output...

Type: Antidote              Number: 36174       Sips: 22

Telnet support will appear in TinyMUX 2.4.0.23 <http://2.4.0.23/> (not yet
out). If TinyFugue begins to receive questions about Telnet problems, ask
them for the codebase and version, and note that 2.4.0.23
<http://2.4.0.23/>and later are the versions with changes in this
area.
 Versions back to TinyMUX 1.x generate the telnet Go-Ahead sequence (IAC
GA), but do not understand any telnet sequences from the client. With the
addition of accents from PennMUSH, TinyMUX 2, avoided the issue again by no=
t
allowing y-umluat to be generated. With the addition of KEEPALIVE, TinyMUX =
2
generates a telnet IAC NOP sequence, and I think TinyFugue responds to that=
.
That generated some support issues for me and I'm sure for TinyFugue as
well.
 That's the history, but now y-umlaut is supported throughout, it will
recognize and respond to telnet sequences including IAC AYT, IAC EC, and
option negoation. At the moment, it will negotiate NAWS and I've added
WIDTH() and HEIGHT() to allow softcode access to the client's windows heigh=
t
and width -- again, similar to PennMUSH. There will undoubted be client
incompatibilities that crop up, and I'm ready to work through those.
 This is a heads up so that people who support TinyFugue are not caught
unaware.

OK, this works great except one thing (And it's most likely really
easy I just can't figure it out...). I need it to put the number of
the potion in a tf variable for each type of potion it encounters.

Thanks in Advance,

Change the end of the python script to:

for name, vals in lowest_sip.items():
    print '/echo -p',
    print '@{n}Type:@{BCgreen} %s%s' % (name, ' '*(20-len(name))),
    print '@{n}Number:@{BCred} %s%s' % (vals['num'], ' '*(10-len(str(vals['num'])))),
    print '@{n}Sips:@{BCblue} %s' % (vals['sips']),
    print ' %%; /set potion_%s=%d' % (name.replace(' ', '_').lower(), vals['num'])

Also change the last line of /get_lowest_sips to:

/repeat -2 1 /quote -S /eval !python sips.py

This will create variables like potion_antidote and
potion_health_restoration.

OK sorry guys I don't know Python at all so I'm not sure what to do (Though
that fix works -almost- perfectly).

When running the script, it defines the variables fine, except for one

"clear potion72990" Type: Physical Well-Being Sips: 50.
>

When I'm running the /get_lowest_sips macro it comes up with an error when
displaying all the potions with lowest numbers for that potion.

Type: Physical Well-Being Number: 72990 Sips: 50
> % SET: illegal variable name: potion_physical_well-being
>

So my guess is that it's erroring out at the dash in there, as all the othe=
r
variables set fine. As I don't know any Python, I don't know how to make it
correct that. For all I care, it can trim off everything after the first
word of the Type: . As long as I know the number and what type it is (Even
if as I said only the first word of the type.)

Thanks again in advance!

On the last line of the python script, add in another replace() command,
like so:

print ' %%; /set potion_%s=%d' % (name.replace(' ', '_').replace('-', '_').lower(), vals['num'])

Now the '-' will be replaced by a '_'.

The basic idea is to build the code with substitution (think perl
interpolation), then execute it (think perl eval).  One way to do this
is with tf's /eval, as above.  But when the code you want to execute
is an expression rather than a full macro body, there is an easier way
with /test, without using /eval.  This works because /test's arguments,
by virtue of being in a macro body, are substituted before being passed
to /test; then /test will evaluate the generated expression.  Thus:

  /set colors_blue=good

  /def toggle_color = \
    /if /test colors_%1 =~ "good"%; /then \
      /test colors_%1 := "bad%; \
    /elseif /test colors_%1 =~ "bad"%; /then \
      /test colors_%1 := "good"%; \
    /endif

  /def key_shift_f9 = /toggle_color blue

Note that, in order to use /test in /if, I had to use the "/if cmd%; /then"
syntax instead of the "/if (expr)" syntax.

What I want to do:
Every twenty four hours, check if a specific world (WoT) is connected.  If 
it isn't, connect to the world.  If it is, disconnect and then reconnect.

What I know how to do:
... there's a /repeat in there somewhere, right?

Help! :)

/repeat -24:00 i \
	/if (is_connected("WoT")) \
		/dc WoT %%; \
	/endif %%; \
	/connect WoT

This will work in tf 5.
In case you are using tf 4 (there is no 'i' option in /repeat):

/def check_wot = \
	/repeat -24:00 1 \
		/if (is_connected("WoT")) \
			/dc WoT %%; \
		/endif %%; \
		/connect WoT %%; \
		/check_wot

And additionaly, manually run /check_wot once, ie. when you start tf.

Apparently in 4.0 stable 1 there is no such thing as is_connected function?

Eh, I forgot to check this. 
It was added in 5.0a10.

Two possible solutions:
1. upgrade to 5.0b7 ;)
2.
/def check_wot = \
	/repeat -24:00 1 \
		/set _check_wot_var $(/listsockets -s) %%; \
		/if (strstr(_check_wot_var, "WoT") >= 0) \
			/dc WoT %%; \
		/endif %%; \
		/connect WoT %%; \
		/check_wot

Tested on 5.0b7, but should work on 4.0s1 too.

Please can someone help me code the stack macros below. The LIST macros
below are included to provide an example of approximately what I am
intending to achieve and an illustration how I intend to use them. Any
constructive critisism on how to write decent tf macros would be greatly
appreciated by a newcomer to tf.
;STACK Methods%
boolean isEmpty(stack)
True if this stack is empty, false otherwise.
item top(stack)
Returns the item at the top of this stack without removing it from the
stack.
item pop(stack)
Removes the item at the top of this stack and returns that item.
item push(item stack)
Pushes an item onto the top of the stack.

 ;LIST
;The following define a set of list macros and an example use of them.
;The example is cut from a macro used to find routes in dark mazes.
;
;usage: head <list>
/def -i head =3D /echo - %{1}

I just wrote this over the summer does all the stack stuff you would 
need.  It was written for tf 4.x but should work under 5.0.

I am curious what exactly you have to do to get an F key to send text to
the game.

Hitting F2 by itself gives me this:
% The key "f2" is undefined; you may use "/def key_f2 = <commands>" to
define
    it.  See "/help keys".
(( Note that this is different instructions/key name than /help
keybinding gives. ))

> /def key_f2 = /send think %R%R%R%R%R%R%R
% DEF: Redefined macro key_f2

I then hit the F2 key, and nothing at all happens.  I have tried
removing the /send, I have tried building a macro that does the same
thing, but none of these seem to work.

Is keybinding for F keys busted in 5.0?

I just did: /def -i key_f2 = say hello
as a simple test, and it worked fine for me.

I'm using version 5.0 beta 6. Perhaps an upgrade is in order?

Huh.  That works.  I wonder why 'think %R%R%R%R%R' as a target doesn't
work.  Let me try a few things.

Okay, it seems that you have to double up on the % signs.  Something is
parsing them before they get sent to the game.

ok, i realize that this has been asked many times in the past, but i
can't seem to get things working...

i have a mac os x box, and i'd LOVE to have some 256 color support...
i'm a bit of a n00b, i can install things fine as long as nothing goes
wrong... but so far, i can't seem to compile xterm w/ 256 color
support, nor can i seem to find anything else that works (tried eterm
-- fink's verson does not seem to work, and it doesn't like to compile
for me). anyone completed this task and can give me pointers?

thank you!
-doug

I'm thinking of tackling how to move around my mud by using python to 
implement A* over paths saved in a mysql database. If I don't have to 
reinvent the wheel, i'd rather not so if you have some code you should 
share, it would be greatly appreciated :)
