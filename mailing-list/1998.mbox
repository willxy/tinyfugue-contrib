/def -p2 -ag -mregexp -t'\[(.*)\]' = \
/echo -p @{green}[@{magenta} %P1 @{green}]

Something like that. -p evaluates @{} colour codes and such.. (Also
newlines, tabs, etc. etc)

Mad.

That has to be {Cgreen} of course ;)

Okay, let's take it one step further.  TinyMUX has global channel aliases
that look like this when a message comes over them:

[Public] Spiritus waves.
[Public] Joe says, "Hi!"

What if I wanted the brackets high white and the inside low cyan for
instance? <and the text after to default to normal>

If that can be done, can I define different colors for different channels?
Like [Guest]
     [Wizards]
     [Code]
               And so forth?

Thanks in advance.. all this is rather new to me.

@{BCwhite}[@{n}@{Ccyan}%p1@{BCwhite}]%pr

yeah... try

/def -qag -mglob -t'[Guest] *' highlightguest = /echo -p
@{Cred}[@{Cyellow}Guest@{Cred}]@{n} %{-1}

for an example... you need tf 4.0 to do these though. You can see /help
attributes for a list of what you can put in there.

And to take this one step further:

/def -ag -mregexp -t'\[(.*)\](.*)' = \
  /if (%{P1} =~ "Guest") \
    /set COLOURIZE_HOOK=Cwhite%;\
  /elseif (%{P1} =~ "Wizards") \
    /set COLOURIZE_HOOK=Cgreen%;\
  /elseif (%{P1} =~ "Code") \
    /set COLOURIZE_HOOK=Cyellow%;\
  /else \
    /set COLOURIZE_HOOK=Cred%;\
  /endif%;\
  /eval /echo -p @{Cred}[@{%{COLOURIZE_HOOK}}%P1@{Cred}]@{n} %P2

I haven't tested this :) But I think you get the idea..

Mad.

Okay, my ISP has TF 4.0a3 installed.. and I cut and pasted it exactly as you
have it typed.  When I start TF up, it gives me an error as soon as it hits
the line starting with the @{Cred} .. etc.  Do I need to load a library or
something first?

I have tested and am now trying to find colors I like for this:

/def -ag -wSpaceC -mregexp -t'\[(.*)\](.*)' sc_highlight_channels = \
  /set SC_BRACKET_COLOR=BCgreen%;\
  /set SC_CHANNEL_COLOR=Cgreen%;\
  /if (%{P1} =~ "Guest") \
    /set SC_CHANNEL_COLOR=Cwhite%;\
  /elseif (%{P1} =~ "Director") \
    /set SC_BRACKET_COLOR=Cgreen%;\
    /set SC_CHANNEL_COLOR=Cwhite%;\
  /elseif (%{P1} =~ "Public") \
    /set SC_CHANNEL_COLOR=Cwhite%;\
  /endif%;\
  /eval /echo -wSpaceC -p @{%{SC_BRACKET_COLOR}}[@{n}@{%{SC_CHANNEL_COLOR}}%{P1}@{%{SC_BRACKET_COLOR}}]@{n}%{P2}

The problum with that last line being too long is obvous and suggestions
on it I would like...

Couple of thing I couldn't get working:

1. How can I bind something to the TAB-key?
2. How can I get /input to input a space after the string?
3. How can i fetch stuff from prompt? Normal -t'Hp\:([0-9]+)/' didn't
   work, tried /def -q -hPROMPT -t'stuff' but didn't work either...

I tried for hours to get these working, but just couldn't.
Maybe it had something to do with the fact that it was 06.00AM and I was
considerably drunk...

/def -ib'^I' tab = something
make sure you have something else do /dokey page if you're going to do
that, though. Maybe /load spc-page.tf.

you need to use the function form... /test input("something ")

Hey, I'd rather be considerably drunk than sober and having nothing better
to do than answer questions on a mailing list.

Okay, I've done this.. got it working.. and something strange happens.  If I
am in another world, and someone were to speak on the Guest channel in the
'background world', then the message comes up on my screen without doing that
little 'activity in world blah'.  It just pops up like it belongs in world
#2....

If I were to use the above, would that fix it?

nope. You'd need to use -w there also. (and you don't need /eval, but
that's besides the point)

I'd like to put a hilite and a /beep hook together somehow, but, don't know
how to do it.

These are two hilites from a specific world ('ss' ) I play.

/def -w'ss' -p1 -aBCgreen -t'* the scanner light shows green*' scanner_green
/def -w'ss' -p1 -aBCyellow -t'* You see no traces of a paintmark*'
scanner_yellow

They hilite the lines of text that contain these two phrases (very useful
in the course of playing this world). I would also like each of these
phrases to cause a beep.

Would someone show me how to combine the hilite and the beep together? I
would appreciate it alot!

In theory, it should be the option -abBCyellow with the little 'b' for
the bell.  See /help attributes

When I just tried to test it I exercised a bug in rxvt v2.08 ... but it
does work with rxvt 2.20 and tf 4.0a3 - somehow I doubt that this has
changed from one version of tf to the next - time to ask the sysadmin
nicely to upgrade rxvt on this system.

Hohum.

Here is a version I just wrote and which seems to work quite fine, I hope
it helps. It can be found on my tf home page too:
   http://www.ph-cip.uni-koeln.de/~dittmar/tf)

; $Id: emote.tf,v 1.1 1998/01/03 13:55:34 dittmar Exp dittmar $

; Macros for the creation of emotes.
; The plan is to put up an alias for emotes in the mud, with two distict
; forms: one form when not given a target, a second form when given a target.
; All these emote commands are appended to a file emotes.tf.
;
; usage:
; /makeemote <name> <emote text without the command emote>
;       creates the alias <name> (if it does not yet exist) and defines
;       the emote text for the version without target. If the version with
;       target does not yet exist, it's defined to be the same as without
;       target.
; /makepmote <name> <emote text without the command emote, but with %1 as target>
;       creates the alias <name> (if it does not yet exist) and defines
;       the emote text for the version with target. If the version without
;       target does not yet exist, it's defined to /echo an error message
;       when used.

Hello again!

        No one answered my previous mail. So, I had to try to solve
the problem myself. And I think, I know how to fix it.
        As I had written, I have to connect to the mud through a
proxy. When I do it, all works fine, /proxy_command sends a line
"telnet <host> <port>" to the proxy server and I connect to the
mud. And after that I am immideatelly disconnected from the mud. The
reason is that the first character in the output stream is a newline
character, so the mud acts as if I press enter to the character name
prompt.
        I had to debug tf and I had found that it appends \r\n
sequence to any line sent to the socket. And to the line "telnet ..."
too. I changed the line from "...\r\n" to "...\n" and all worked
right. Not very, but ok. The only thing I did not understand was that
the password I entered was visible. But it is ok, at least I could
connect.
        So, I have to make tf send a special string to the proxy
server, not the one tf thinks it should send. Is it possible ?  There
is a /send command, but I am afraid, it will send the same \r\n ending
lines. I don't know what to do, I can not change the proxy server, but
it seems, I have to modify tf code myself, I don't like this idea.

Waiting for advices...

I'm having problems logging in to a particular MUD using any version of TF 
later than 3.5a20, including 4.0a4 which I installed this evening.  Here are 
the symptoms:

1) I fire up TF and run my /world command to connect.
2) I get the initial messages

---- World <myworld> ----

[Establishing connection]

And the login prompt.
3) I type my username, and instead of getting the "Password:" prompt, it 
echoes my username and just hangs until the MUD times me out.  If I type 
anything else, it echoes it back with the same behavior.

I am on a Solaris 2.5.1 box and running TF in an rxvt window, but I get the 
same behavior with an xterm.  Anyone have any ideas?  I'd really like to 
upgrade from 3.5a20, but right now it's use that version or *gulp* telnet.

I connect and login on other MUDs just fine with the newer TF versions. If 
anyone wants to try connecting to this particular MUD to see the behavior, 
here are the vitals:

IP:   192.233.90.30
Port: 23

You can type "new" at the login prompt and get responses.  Any advice would be 
appreciated.

I put together the following definition to close an automatic log file when
I disconnect from a world.

However, I've become somewhat used to using '/dc' to close a world from TF,
and discovered that '/dc' does not connect with the 'disconnect' hook. Is
there a way to expand or change this definition to work no matter HOW the
connection is closed? My apologies for the bad formatting...

Hi

I took the trigger from that list and modified it for my needs and my
tf version.
It works fine, but there is one problem, I do not understand how to solve.

If I type       /re say hello you guys
I get:          You say: syuguoyolleh

What have I got to modify for getting the spaces back in the output ?


This is the trigger:

/def -i strreverse = \
    /echo $[ strcat(strlen({*})>1 ? \
    $( /strreverse $[substr({*},1)] )  : " ", \
    substr({*},0,1)) ]

/def -i re = /send - %1 $( /strreverse %-1 )



Gruesslings...

How about...
/def dc = /if /@dc %*%; /then /trigger -hdisconnect %*%; /endif

Thanks for all your help, we've talked to the ISP and it looks like the
socket resource thing was a security matter, they've re-arranged things
slightly so my friend will be able to use tinyfugue now that they know
it's an issue. 

Gonna sign off and let my friend get back to using his new tf-ified
account.

Hi all.

I was wondering (mainly for Ken Keys this, I think ;); Why aren't periods
allowed in variable names? This would make making variables containing
filenames a lot easier. Is there any good reason for this?

Mad.

Riiight. version 4.0a4

Okay.

/return %{something}%{something}%{something} goes wrong.

The return value is never passed to the calling function.

/return strcat(something, something, something) however works fine..

Very nice. (Only took me 4 hours to find out)

Is this intentional, am I stupid, or is it a bug?

Mad.

It's intentional. according to /help return, /return only returns
expressions like /test does, rather than regular substitution. (normally
to do expressions in regular substitutions you do $[whatever()]).
the same way that /if (expression) ... /endif does rather than /if
/macro%; /then ... /endif does.

Hmmm.

Okay. I just found some 'not so really wanted behaviour' by TF.

Consider the following case:

/if (something) \
  /return true%;\
/else \
  /return false%;\
/endif

Now. You would more or less expect this to return the values 'true' and
'false'. Well. That doesn't seem to be the case.

So I'm stupid ;)

Mad.

use true() and false() instead. Although you can probably get away with
/return !!(something) or just using if (something) directly in the if you
plan to use it in...

Whatever is passed to /return is only evaluated as an expression.  So if
there are variables %true and %false in existence, the above code will work
fine.  Or, you may be wanting to use this:
/return "true"

If you want 1 and 0 returned, try
/set true 1
/set false 0

or just /return 1 and /return 0.

	Create a one word @alias and log in via that ;)

Which you have to do anyway since you can't log into the game using -any-
method (tf, raw telnet, simplemu, etc) unless you've done so.  MUSH's
assume that white space seperates the name from the password.  So, if you've
a character that has a space in their name (like many of my pc's do) you
need to create a single word @alias for your char, or you have to connect
using the dbref of the char instead of the name... otherwise MUSH will 
interpret the second word of your name as your password.

it's a standard warning you can safely ignore. You're overriding the
builtin /dc, which calls the builtin /@dc itself. If you want, you can gag
it briefly by putting this line before it in your .tfrc:
/def -1ag -h'conflict' gagconflict

Actually, last I knew, you could 

connect "Jose Jones" rlRlRL

and that would work. The difficulty comes in persuading tf to recognize the
quotes as a word-container.

How can a specific bit of information be written to a seperate file?

I have a macro already written that needs to be updated to actually WORK.
The matching part of it does work, but, writing to a seperate log file
dosn't anymore. This macro was written back around version 3.4 or 3.5. I
was told to use the local echo port to create a dummy (logged) world and
send the info to that world.

At one time, this worked. However, I am now running TF on a Win95 computer
and the macro no longer works as-is.  What I need is a way to write the
information saved in 'locsaved' to a file (preferably named 'claims.log').
If the date could be added to the string being written it would help, but,
it would not HAVE to be necessary.

I hope this question makes sense.

Unless you do something like... ooo... connect "<2+ word name>" <passwd> :)

ObTF: It'd be nice if /addworld accepted quotation makrs around the name
too for such situations. :)

if it's one line at a time, you can use fwrite()...I'm sure tfwrite() is
favored though.

ok, how about this instead:
/set locsavedhandle=$[tfopen("a","claims.log")]
/fg ss
/def -mregexp -t'^Loc: \([A-Z]+ [0-9]+ [A-Z]+\) ' lcsave=\
  /set locsaved=%P1
/def -t'*You see no traces of a paintmark*' lctrig=\
  /test tfwrite({locsavedhandle}, strcat(datestr(), " ", {locsaved}))

I'm assuming that datestr() is another previously-defined macro you had,
or else just use ftime().

command? ie like a mini script?

Yeah, if you do the fillowing line for the automatic login:

/addlp WorldName CharacterName Password adress port filename

where filename is a file which is startet when you start that world entry.
There you can define your triggers or commands for the menu ;-)

Ok, given the following :

/addlp Testmud Testie testpassword test.mud.com 4444 ~/tf-lib/testfile.tf

testfile.tf is the following:
/repeat -5 1 /send 1


If you connect to 'Testmud', then the file testfile.tf will send
the string '1' to the world automatically after 5 seconds sine logged in.
The 5 seconds pause is to  make sure, that the menu receives the input.

I prefer defining a hook that will undefine itself in the script indicated
at the end of the /addworld line:

/def -p10 -w'Whatever-World' -mglob -t'Some unique pattern that appears in the menu' menu_trigger = /send -w'Whatever-World' 1%;/undef menu_trigger



The -w switch to the /def makes sure it only triggers on text from that
world.

I'm sure it could be quite a bit more elegant, but it's worked great for
me so far.

Has anyone made a TF for NT that doesn't keep disconnecting over
a little lag. I was told by some TF programmers they were going
to correct somer bugs in the NT version but I never heard anything
of it since then. Also TF in NT likes to crash on me every so often
course the one for Unix did too.

It's very simple.

Add this to your .tfrc, or whatever.

/def -T'MyMudType' -hLOGIN = ${world_character} %; ${world_password} %; /send 1

And then when you define your world, define it to be that type.

/addworld -TMyMudType MyMudName MyCharacter MyPassword MyFileToLoad

Actually, I just have two questions...:)  First of all, I remember seeing
a while back that someone had made available a binary version of TinyFugue
for Win32, but I don't seem to have the address for it anymore.  Could
someone let me know where I might find it?  I don't really relish the
prospect of downloading all 13 megs of the CDK on this slow (14.4!) modem,
so...:)

Second...I used to be fairly good at writing triggers for certain
things...like if a certain person said a different word, it would
automatically give a certain reply?  However, I can't figure out how I did
that before...so could someone give me an example, please?

Thanks, all!

ok, there are two addresses I've seen for it so far..


http://www.randomc.com/~hawkmoon/ had it, and

http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Studios/8949/tf.html has one with the
console patches.

ok, here's an example...
/def -t'says *, "*log*"*' autoreply = say Huh huh, you said 'log'.

put whatever you want there, of course.
be careful about loops if your reply has something you're triggering on.

A quite simple question:

The tfio functions supports some sort of streaming protocol, however,
would it also be possible to let this function as a filehandle? So I can
for example compare timestamps of files in tf itself, instead of having to
refer it to a shell command?

Mad.

I know this list may not be adequate for this question, but AFAIK, no list
is.

I'd like to know if there is any provision on TCP protocol for
wide-character tcp streams. Feel free to answer privately if you find this
too off-topic.

A friend of mine asked me to write him an automatically triggering command. I
haven't a clue how to do it. This is what he wants:
After he has been idle for 5 minutes, and if there has been no more activity
on the MUSH (someone saying something, someone paging him, etc...) he wants
to @pemit him this:
..................................................... Fri Jan 9 16:51:05 1998

Then he wants the counter to reset. If there is activity on his screen (from
the MUSH, not like the you have new mail in /var/spool/mail/ messages), he
wants to have the dots appear again after 5 minutes. If no activity, other
then the dots he does not want the dots to appear. 

Can someone give me a trigger or something to do this with?

I've posted this question before but never got any response. I've been
trying to install tf-40a4 on BSD/386 and I get the following error
message:

Stop.

Can anyone tell me what I have to do to get this to install?

What!? BSD/386??? That must be ancient, or something. I thought it was
extinct? :-) Try installing FreeBSD 2.2.5, or some other recent BSD,
instead. See http://www.freebsd.org/

This is a " x ? y : z" construct in the source, that your compiler seems
not to be able to see actually IS a constant, after optimisation.
This means your compiler is too old and you should install a new version
of gcc and compiler tf with that.

Stick this in colors.tf and load.  You can then use `/colors' to
get a table of the various foreground/background color combinations.
You can specify other attributes to /colors to see how they look also.
e.g. `/colors B' for bold, etc.

Note you must be running tf with a terminal emulator which understands
color.  See `/help color'.


/def colors =\
    /let colors=black white red magenta yellow green cyan blue%;\
    /let fg_colors=%{colors}%;\
    /let bg_colors=%{colors}%;\
    /let other_attr=%{1}%;\

I noticed (using 4.0a4) that when I /edit just the trigger part of a
partial highlight trigger (using /edit -t'whatever' macroname), that it
gives:

% edit: "-P" requires "-mregexp -t<pattern>"

and then undefines the macro.
Does this happen for anyone else? -mregexp is supposed to be implied so
I don't include it for partial highlights.

Hi.

You wanted to know how to send "telnet host port\r"? Try this in your
.tfrc:


;;; Undefine standard proxy_command
/undef proxy_command

;;; Slightly altered proxy_command, adapted from tf-lib/stdlib.tf
;;; for tf-40a4 by Marcus Blake Jan 98
/def -i proxy_command = \
    /test send(strcat("telnet ", ${world_host}, " ", ${world_port}, \
     char(13)), "", 0)%; \
    /trigger -hCONNECT ${world_name}%; \
    /if (${world_character} !~ "") \
        /trigger -hLOGIN ${world_name}%; \
    /endif


I can't test this, as I don't have access to any proxy servers but it
*might* work. :-)

Let me know it it does/doesn't work, or if you want it explained.

Is there any way to start up tf so it doesn't connect to any world?

If I don't put a world on the command line it defaults to the first
world.  I fixed it sorta by making the first line of my .tfrc look
like this:


; dummy world so we don't default to connecting anywhere
/addworld                 x     x     x      x                      


But then I get an error 'cause it can't connect to x.  Not particularly
a problem - just annoying!

[...]

The problem with that approach is that if I do a shell alias like:
   alias tf 'tf -n'
the it will work fine if I do:
shell> tf

It will work, because it will not connect to any world, which is fine.
But if I do:

shell> tf my.mud.org 1234

It will NOT work, since it will not connect anywhere, and I wanted it to
connect to my.mu.org.

This because "-n" means "Do not connect to any world at start up", instead
of "don't connect to the first world in the files automatically".

There is a difference, and I think changing the meaning of "-n" to be the
later definition would be a very good thing.

Well, she answered your original question, how to have tf not connect
to a world initially.  If you want more complex behavior, I'd point
you in the direction of a 'tf shell script' which checked for
arguments or not, then ran the appropriate "real tf" command.

You shoudl have clarified teh first time.
the simplest solution is what i do.
alias my "tf Delusions"
alias tf1 " tf -n"

its a whole 1 character more on the command line.

Look in the manpage of TF... 

If you start TinyFugue by typing 'tf -n' then no world will be started.

I took this command and changed .tfrc. At least I have a command that
makes tf connect to a mud. Great thanks!. But not all works fine. I
will tell you how all goes on.

Strange. I tried

/send -n $[strcat("telnnet 199.1.96.150 9999", char(13))]

before, but for some reason it did not really send it. Function send
works ok.

The defenition of proxy_command as you wrote to me does not work
well. When loading, tf complains:

% Redefined macro proxy_command
% test: expression syntax error: expected ',' or ')' after function argument, found '.'.

Don't know how to fix it. When I just type /test... in the command
line there are no problems. I think all this is because of world_host
(see below). I had written this to call from proxy_command instead of
/test...

/def cf=/test send(strcat("telnet ", ${world_host}, " ", ${world_port}, char(13)), "", 0)

But for some reason tf does not want to substitute ${world_host}. I
tried to see world_host is set:

/set world_host
% world_host not set globally
/set world_port
% world_port not set globally

Weird. I don't know what it means :(

Only the macro:

/def cf=/test send(strcat("telnet 199.1.96.150 9999", char(13), "", 0)

works fine. Anyway, it works and I will see if I can do something with
these variables. Thank you!

Gregory.

I had the same problem, although I failed to specify it in the firstq
question.  Nevermind, I've written a quickie shell script to do the
job:

=== begin ~/bin/tf ===
#!/bin/sh
#
# TF Shell Scripty thing
#
# Last updated by gossamer on Thu Jan 15 22:55:04 EST 1998
#

tf=/usr/local/bin/tf

if [ "X$*" = "X" ] ; then
  $tf -n
else
  $tf $*
fi
=== end ~/bin/tf ===

Nothing personal, but this is a rather ugly solution. It's a workaround.
Sometimes it's neccesary with workarounds, but not here. However, having a
script _does_ works, and was suggested by a few people. A few also said I
should have specified my original question, even though I didn't write
the original question. :-P Check your references, people :-)

There is no reason why the -n option should work like it does. 
Having to resort to a script seems like a bad solution to me, when the easy
and seemingly more correct fix is to change the -n option behaviour, or add
a -N switch too, or something. The reason I mentioned it was more of a
suggestion to Ken, then anything else. Another nice way of doing it would
be for TF to have a "auto_connect" variable that was "on", and that you could
simply set early in your .tfrc to off, and it would not connect to the
first world, but instead start like with "-n" if you didn't give any
arguments, or connect to given world if you gave arguments.

Oh well, enough about that...

I didn't get any responses to my original post, so I thought I'd send once 
more to see if anyone can help (please?).  If anyone wants to take this 
offline with me, email me directly, and I'll work with you and post a 
summary/result to the list when we find a solution.  Thanks!

I'm having problems logging in to a particular MUD using any version of TF 
later than 3.5a20, including 4.0a4 which I installed this evening.  Here are 
the symptoms:

1) I fire up TF and run my /world command to connect.
2) I get the initial messages

---- World <myworld> ----

[Establishing connection]

And the login prompt.
3) I type my username, and instead of getting the "Password:" prompt, it 
echoes my username and just hangs until the MUD times me out.  If I type 
anything else, it is echoed back with the same behavior.

I am on a Solaris 2.5.1 box and running TF in an rxvt window, but I get the 
same behavior with an xterm.  Anyone have any ideas?  I'd really like to 
upgrade from 3.5a20, but right now it's use that version or *gulp* telnet.

I connect and login on other MUDs just fine with v4.0a4. If anyone wants to 
try connecting to this particular MUD to see the behavior, here are the vitals:

IP:   192.233.90.30
Port: 23

You can type "new" at the login prompt and get responses.  Any advice would be 
appreciated.

Pending a more elegant solution from Ken (ie a config file setting) you
can reverse the function of the '-n' flag just by altering 2 lines in the
'main.c' source file.

At the start of main() you will find the line :-

  int worldflag = TRUE;

alter that to :-

  int worldflag = FALSE;

and then about 14 lines down just after the "case 'n':" alter the line
that says :-

  worldflag = FALSE;

to read :-

  worldflag = TRUE;

Then re-run 'sh unixmake' and you have a version of tf that will not try

Apologies to Ken for butchering his good code :-)

This is primarily a "which is better to use" question.

The guy who first showed me TF and gave me sample .tf files to 
look at used sockmload for all his worlds.  For those that
aren't familiar with it, "/sockmload on" means that whenever a
world is /fg'ed, it loads the file associated with it when the
world was defined.

By the sockmload method, each world has a file associated with
it that first /purges when that world is switched to, then
loads all files and stuff for that world.  Obviously all that
loading and purging isn't totally efficient, but it works fine.

After lurking in this group for a while, I get the impression
that most of you don't use this feature, but use WORLD hooks
instead.  Also, /help sockmload specifically says "the WORLD
hook is more useful than sockmload").

Well if its more useful and the standard I certainly want to
know more about it... I understand how hooks work, but I'm not
sure what the best way to convert my existing files is, or how
exactly you all do things normally.

What do you normally do about commands that have the same name
but totally different functions in different worlds?  And what
about commands that you really only want defined in certain
worlds?  Do y'all just have a whole lot of WORLD hooks?  Or
what?  Or is this not something most of you deal with?  I often
use one instance of TF to connect to several worlds, so this
is important for me.

If I'm  not making sense, please ask for clarification.

Thanks in advance...

Hello,
I am running tf in an xterm window (Solaris unix).
The xterm emulation of tf doesnt have much for keybinds and Colours.
Is there a way to get ANSI colors and keybinds work in an xterm window ?
If you know something to solve this please send me an email.
thanks
Erwin

I fear the world hook won't do it for you.

You already mentioned the point where it fails, I'll describe it with one
example. In world "Ramona" I play Ramona, a cleric who can cast a 'create
food' spell. So whenever she's hungry, she just grows a mushroom and eats
it. I defined the command /eat to exactly do that.
Now in world "Ayla" I play a thief. She does not know any magic, so she has
to take a bread (or whatever she has as food) out of her backpack and eat
it. For me as player it's the same action, eating, so I want to define this
macro to be called /eat too. But this would overwrite the macro from world
Ramona (even with -w switch).

There's one workaround if you have only few such macros. You can put in an
/if switch checking for the actual world and from this choosing what to do.
But it's ugly especially if you have to update them all for every change and
every new world ... (If you need an example for that, I can post it.)

The point of macros which are only defined in one world is no problem.
/def -w<world> ... will do the trick.

So, if you only have very few diffently implemented macros (like the
Ramona/Ayla example), using /def -w (and with this, the switching of macros
by the world hook) would be possible. Else stick to /sockmload on I'd say.

I perhaps have a similar problem on a linux machine. It does the connect to
a tiny mud, and then something goes wrong with typing the name. No matter
whether tf does the automatical login or whether I type the name myself, the
next prompt, the password, will be somehow answered by the mud (did not yet
find out what it does send), which immediately makes the mud close the
connection. I had this problem with both 4.0a3 and 4.0a4. As the
implementors of the mud banned all who are not coming from the same subnet,
you can't test it for me ...

There is nothing wrong with TF. It handles both keybindings and colors
just fine. Try "/help bind" and "/help color" in TF. If colors doesn't
show like they should in your xterm (very likely on a normal solaris xterm)
it's not because of TF, but because the xterm can't handle it, or is not set
up correctly.

Good luck,

This should be easy to solve by doing something like this:

---- File ~/mud/common_macros.tf ----
/def eat = /${world_name}_eat %*
----  end file ----

---- File ~/mud/w1.tf ----
/load ~/mud/common_macros.tf

/load ~/mud/common_macros.tf

----  end file ----

---- in .tfrc ----
/addworld w1 my.mud.org 1234 ~/mud/w1.tf

	If you have something that you want to happen at the moment
you switch to a world, then use a WORLD hook.  However, if your
only problem is same-name macros, like Susan's example, then you
don't even need that.
	Using Susan's example of /eat, she doesnt' want to remember
something like /eat_priest and /eat_theif; just /eat, and have it
work no matter where she is.  Well, since she, and you, have already
defined your world-specific /eat macros in your sockmload files,
you only need to do two things.  Redefine all your macros as
/eat_specificworldname.  Then /def eat = /eat_${world_name}.
That way, you only have to remember /eat, and it will call the
correct world's /eat-specific macro.  Of course, if you have a
world that doesn't use /eat, then you'll get the warning:
% Macros eat_noteatworld does not exist
But if you try to /eat on that world anyway, then you're alreayd
makinga mistake. :)
	This way, you dont' need a huge /if /elseif* /endif
structure, and it's only a really small change to yoru existing macros.
Oh, and you'd want to take the files out of yoru sockmload /world
definition, and /load them as normal.

Let me try to do such a thing. It uses rather dirty tricks, like a trigger
that triggers on everything which comes from the MU*, but it might work.
Still, I hope this inspired our gurus to write down a better version.

I don't know MUSHes, so the command sent to the MU* might be wrong,
please, MUSH-users, correct it if necessary.

Here it goes:


;; First of all, define a command which resets the variable activity_counter
;; whenever there is any activity from the world:
/def -mglob -t"*" reset_activity_counter = /set activity_counter 0

;; Define the macro dotick which calls /tick and then tells tf to call
;; itself again after 15 seconds, and start this sequence. Do so only if
;; /dotick is not yet defined (else you have ticks more than once every
;; 15 seconds).
/if /!ismacro dotick %; /then \
    /def dotick = /tick %%; /repeat -0:00:15 1 /dotick %;\
    /dotick %;\
/endif

;; In tick you can define all things that should be done or checked every
;; 15 seconds. In this case, only activity_counter is incremented, and
;; in case the player is idle since 5 minutes and the counter reached
;; 20 (4 ticks per minute, 5 minutes), the @pemit command is sent to
;; the MU*. I use the /time command here to get the formatted time.
;; The number of dots will be too low, add as many as necessary...
/def tick = \
    /if ((idle()>300)&(activity_counter>20)) \
        /set activity_counter 0 %;\
        /send $(/time @pemit .................. %a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y) %;\
    /else /set activity_counter=$[activity_counter+1] %;\
    /endif



I hope this helps,

Thanks! There's only one problem with this... It repeats weither or not there
has been activity on the MUSH. I want it to trigger again, only if someone
speaks to me, or pages me, or there is other activity on the MUSH. If there
isn't any activity it doesn't trigger again.

Erwin,

The standard xterm will not support colors. The two programs I use are
rxvt or color-xterm.

Both programs need to be built on the machine as they are not supplied
with solaris.

You could try running a find to see if either of these are already
installed on your system.

I assume there is some way to send command outside of tf when running
tf.  Example.

I have tf running and wanna send a

./screen -d to my shell to disconnect that session how can I do it?
Thanks for the info.

If you've ever wanted to use regmatch() but were having difficulties
because it'd destroy other Pn values that you wanted/needed to keep,
then this is the package for you.

I may later be extending regmatch_safe to take additional arguments
allowing you to specify variable names where it can save Pn subs from
that particular call.

The -w on a def only applies to hooks and triggers, not calls by name.

The -w option on a macro is a totally different thing than a world
hooks.  See `/help hooks'.

why not just assign the ones you want to keep to other variables with /let?
That's what I do.

Because it doesn't work in several situations.  Let's say you were going
to write a new "helper" function like `/replace' but you needed to use
regmatch inside of that.  Then anyone who called your /replace would
also have to know to put them in other variables, because just calling
/replace would destroy them.

In general, any utility kind of function you write that isn't designed
to explictly change Pn values, should not change them.  In the past,
this often meant avoiding regmatch or making callers do a bunch of
unneccesary variable renaming of their own.


And yes, using /let with local renaming works fine for many situations,
it just doesn't cut it for others.

On Solaris 2.x use 'dtterm' which should be installed if you are using
dtwm.  This is a xterm compatible program which supports ansi colors.
Fixed the problem for me. (I think its in /usr/dt/bin/)

Redefining /eat with sockmload is okay if you never execute /eat for a
background world.  But what if you want to to make a trigger in each
world that calls /eat when the world says you're hungry?

First, you wouldn't want the trigger to be redefined every time you switched
foreground worlds, because you want to detect hunger in a world even if that
world is backgrounded.  So you need to have all the triggers defined all
the time (or at least when the corresponding worlds are connected), using
the -w option.  e.g.

  /def -wfoo -t'You feel hungry.' foo_hungry = /eat
  /def -wbar -t'Your stomach grumbles.' bar_hungry = /eat

Second, you need to have a different version of /eat for each world.
As others have suggested, this can be done by writing an /eat "wrapper"
that calls another macro based on the world name:

  /def eat = /${world_name}_eat %*

Putting this all together:

  Put these commands in your .tfrc or some other global file:
    /addworld foo ... foo.tf
    /addworld bar ... bar.tf
    /def eat = /${world_name}_eat %*

  File foo.tf:
    /def foo_eat = eat %*
    /def -wfoo -t'You feel hungry.' foo_hungry = /eat

  File bar.tf:
    /def bar_eat = feed me %*
    /def -wbar -t'Your stomach grumbles.' bar_hungry = /eat


...with sockmload=off, because the world-specific versions are never deleted,
so they only need to be loaded when you first connect.

Granted, /foo_hungry could call /foo_eat directly, instead of going through
/eat.  But you still want /eat for manual calls, which was how this whole
thing started.



None of that has anything to do with WORLD hooks, because it was written
such that nothing needed to be done when changing the foreground world.
But in cases where you do need something executed when you bring a world
to the foreground, those commands are often different than (or a subset
of) the commands you want executed when you first connect.  In those
cases, it's usually better to have a WORLD hook execute those commands,
instead of reloading everything with sockmload.

Sockmload is okay for simple things, but it's not very flexible.  To
get more sophisticated, you usually have to use techniques like WORLD
hooks, /def -w, and wrapper macros with ${world_name}.

Hello,

on my MUD there is a info channel which displays stuff like
[INFO]: Blah blah

I would like to replace this line with something like
[INFO]: 98/01/18 12:03 Blah blah
but could not figure out how to do this.

Could anyone give me a hint please?
Thank you.

Harry

ok, here's a hint... the function time() will get the current time, and
the function ftime() will format it however you want.

if you want an example, try this:
/def -agG -mglob -t'\[INFO\]: *' infochannel = /echo -w [INFO]: \
	$[ftime("%y/%m/%d %H:%M",time())] %{-1}

Hi everyone, I've been a subscriber to this list for a long time but am
now just having a chance to try some things with tf.

I have a ton of aliases for myself defined in tiny.macros, most of which
are simple direction aliases for getting around on the mud that I play on.
I have four aliases, say, to go from the North Gate of a city to my guild
in a different city, and it's a lot of walking.

Currently, I'm typing in each one individually, waiting for it to finish,
and then typing the next one in.  What I'm wondering if there is a way to
set up a trigger to call the next directional alias when the title of the
room that I arrive in is received from the mud.  I wouldn't want it to
call the alias every time I walk in that room, however, just when I call a
certain macro that is going to string all 4 aliases together, taking
pauses after each alias execution to wait for the room title.

So I'd like something like this. I call *one* macro that:

Calls the first speedwalking alias, then waits for a string,
calls the second walking alias, then waits, etc.

But I don't want those triggers for the room titles to be global, just
active when I call that particular macro.

Thanks for any help in advance.

/def toguild = \
   /def -1 -t"<string to trigger on>" toguildtrig1 = /toguild2%; \
   /def -1 -t"<string to trigger on>" toguildtrig2 = /toguild3%; \
and so on...

The -1 means the macros are one-shots, which means after the first time
they execute (in this case, the first time the text to trigger on is seen),
they are no longer defined.  So the triggers will only be active from when
you do /toguild until they execute once.

/help def for more info.

I recommend using /substitute instead of gagging and /echoing.  This way,
other triggers and hilites of lower priority (less than 999 in this example)
can still apply to the reformatted line.

  /def -F -p999 -mglob -t'\[INFO\]: *' infochannel = \
      /substitute [INFO]: $[ftime("%y/%m/%d %H:%M",time())] %{-1}

See /help topics:  /substitute, time(), ftime(), $[], priority

This may be clearly said somewhere, but as I am rather tired, I can't seem
to find it. When I do a simple /def trigger, that sends output back to the
game, how can I set the trigger to only sdend it to the world the trigger
was in, not to the foreground world?

Hm, please explain again what you want it to do and when. I'm not getting
your point.

At the moment, it sends this @pemit line to the MU* every 5 minutes while
you are idle and no output came from the MU*.

How do you want it changed?

Don't forget to define something like

/def stoptoguild = \
    /undef toguildtrig1 %;\
    /undef toguildtrig2 %;\
...

(or if you don't want error messages:

   /if /ismacro toguildtrig1 %; /then /undef toguildtrig2 %; /endif %;\
   ...)

This way you can stop your rush to the guild in case of some emergency 
(like an attack of something aggressive, or running out of movement points,
or the help call of a friend or ...)

Use /def -w<worldname> ... to restrict triggers to one world, 
/send -w<worldname> to explicitly send something to this world.

Usually, each trigger is executed in the world where it was evoked. Are you
using things like /repeat? (/repeat will be executed in the active world,
not necessarily the calling world).

I believe adding the -w{world_name} to the trigger def will do that.

I'd like to be able to /log with different %emulation than what's
displayed on my screen, for example I'd want ny logfiles to show same
colourcodes as my normal rxvt, as it behaves when %emulation=raw, just
raw emulation screws up the command-line and other such nastieties. 
(turning the logfiles back to plaintext is a simple grep -v operation)

so sugestion for new version, %log_emulation, name says it all

thanks, /Continuity

... unless you use /repeat -w
/repeat -w<worldname> ... execute the repeat in the given world.
/repeat -w ... execute the repeat in the world active when the repeat was
started.

I'm sure Susan realizes this but I thought I'd post it for the sake of
the guy who asked the question.

I don't _think_ there is a way to do this other than lots of overlapping
triggers, but I could be wrong...

I have partial hilites set up on certain people's names.  eg:
/def -Fp10 -PCcyan -t'Emrys' emrys_colortrig

I also have hilites on shouts, etc:
/def -Fp20 -aBCblue,Cbgblack -t'*just logged on from*' logon_colortrig

Now if the text "Emrys just logged on from" comes up, the name ends up
getting displayed in bold cyan because of the color mixing.  Normally
this isn't that big of a deal, but bold cyan is a rather obscene-looking
color on my term.  Is there a way to cause partial hilites to JUST hilite
with the pattern giving, ignoring any other attributes that might get
applied by other triggers?  I know I could come up with overlapping stuff
that would do it, but I thought I'd make sure there wasn't some simple way
I was overlooking first.

Note that making 'just logged on from' a partial won't do what I need
because this is just a simple example of a general problem I'm having.

I downloaded coolviews cygwin.dll version and replaced it with
the old cygwin.dll to try and fix the scrollregion. 
I then went into tinyfugue typed /set emulation=raw
then made a macro
/def x = /echo $[char(27)[18;25r
then typed /x
how ever the whole screen continued to scroll , lines 18 to 25
should on scroll after this. Is there anyway to fix this. I need
scroll region to work for certain project I am planning and I want
to use tinyfugue with it. I dontk now how to compile tinyfugue
my self, i'm just an end user :)
oh and I only have one version of cygwin.dll on my system.

I'm working with Sergei's patched cygwin now for a possible fix of the 
scrolling and jumpy screen problems, though I must admit, the problem is 
hardly noticeable on my machine with a fast video card and enough vram 
that I'm not pushing it's limits at 1280x1024x16bpp.

The scrolling is not jumpy I just need scrollregion to work.
So I can make things that can allow part of the screen to scroll
while the rest doesn't. I would hate to use CRT program which
sux for mudding instead. But how come replacing the cygwin.dll from
coolview didn't fix the scroillregion problem anyways ?

Yes, this does sound similar, except that the MUD doesn't disconnect me, it 
times me out due to lack of input.  Perhaps the clue lies in what changed 
between v3.5a20 and the v4.0xx releases?

Occasionally, when I use /sh on TF (alpha 3) under OS/2 (Warp Connect), I 
get a system halt with TRAP 000E/ERRORCD 0002.  It has only started 
occuring since I upgraded hardware (definitely a probably cause), but 
this trap ONLY occurs in TF when using /sh, and hasn't happened since I 
went to alpha 4.  But, I haven't used /sh much since then, so the error 
may still exist.

I have a feeling it's probably related to a hardware problem, but 
figured I might as well report this, and see if anyone else has had this 
happen under alpha 3.

I can give exact TRAP info if requested, provided it does occur again.

Ok, I'll try. I'm giving examples from the MUSH and showing what it does now,
and what I'd like it to do. Hope this helps. 

This is what it does right now:
  <Sample output from the MUSH, and comments>

Zothar says, "OK, have fun."
Bit goes to work on Mrs Jones computer. 
  <after 5 minutes, it send the @pemit command, and resets the counter>

  <after another 5 minutes, it resets the counter again...>
............. Tues Jan 20 08:11:46 1998 <repeats forever>

This is what I would like it to do:

Zothar says, "OK, have fun."
Bit goes to backup power on Tues Jan 20 07:56:46 1998. <after 5 minutes>
............ Tues Jan 20 08:01:46 1998  
  <It does not reset the counter until something else comes over the MUSH.>
Bit returns to full power at Tues Jan 20 08:38:23 1998. 
  <The counter has been reset now by activity on the MUSH.>
Bit has returned successful!
Zothar says "Spiffy."
  <After another 5 minutes it sends the @pemit to the MUSH again.>
........... Tues Jan 20 08:43:23 1998
Zothar says, "Boy talktive today aren't we?"

Does this make better sense? I apoligize, I'm pretty lousy at explaining
things...

I know, that was a stupid mistake... I apoligize again.

OK, here's my version. To all tf-gurus: Do you have any idea how to avoid
the -t'*' trigger?

;; First of all, define a tick for tf. It consists of two parts:

You can make use of the idle(world) function.

Also, your most recent version only generates the @pemit when the
trigger runs, so it'll only @pemit at the first activity after 5 minutes
of idle.  Rather than emitting immediately the first 5 minutes of idle.

Although, personally, I think your version is more useful.  (if you
replace @pemit with /echo so things go in the right order).  Since when
you get a line after an X minute pause, you'd see the starting time for
the next batch of text, rather than the requested version which shows
an approximate end time of the previous batch.


You might not want to call the command tick, since there is a tick.tf in 
the distribution which defines /tick.


Instead of checking every 15 seconds, we try to check only as often as
something could change.  So when things are slow, we only check once per 
5 minutes.

Once the keyboard has gone idle 5 minutes, we check all the worlds.  If
any of them have been idle 5 minutes and we haven't already sent the
pemit, we send the pemit, we mark that we sent it, and we install a
one-shot world specific trigger which will clear our `sent it' flag
once activity resumes.

This of course, doesn't work, since the @pemit causes activity itself.

Change:
	    /send -w%{world} @pemit .................. $[ftime(fmt,time())]%;\
to:
	    /echo -w%{world} .................. $[ftime(fmt, time())]%;\


and it'll do what you want, but not send anything to the mud which will
mess up the timers.

Hi,

at the moment I'm worrying if I'm not doing wrong ...

Since a while I collect all pieces of code published on this list which seem
inventive or useful for me. (It's a very subjective selection of course.)
Some weeks ago I started to publish these things in the WWW. Most of them
are excerpts of the mail, including the name of the coder. I only left this
part out if I don't remember any more.

Still there's the question if I may do so. What do you think?

Authors of the stuff up to now are: David Moore, Andrew C.M. McClintock,
Ken Keys, Joel Baker and Kotivuori Nuutti. And of course my own stuff.

Susan Dittmar

I guess most of the people on this list would not object, but you should
probably ask for permission anyway.  Some may not object to having code
being publicized but may want to conceal their addresses (to protect
themselves from web-scanning spammers).

Ok, this module is on a special request by Susan Dittmar; who set up
that great site with collected TF macros ;-)

I have quite a large .tfrc, and to keep track of all my functions and
standard functions that I've redefined, I like to use my own help file.
I used to do this with /myhelp that would consult TFRCHELP, a help file
with the same structure as TFHELP (the standard TF helpfile).
However, a redefinition of /help works much better: It calls the
builtin /@help, using my own helpfile. And when this results in a
message about no available help (ok, anything less than 61 chars);
then it consults the default TFHELP file on this subject.

Details about creating your own help file are are listed below.

;; The name of your own help file. The index file (~/.tfrc-help.idx)
;; must be available as well...
/set TFRCHELP ~/.tfrc-help

;; Use my help if it exists, fall back on builtin stuff otherwise
/def -i help = \
	/let tmphelp=%{TFHELP}%;\
	/set TFHELP=%{TFRCHELP}%;\
	/let helplen=$[strlen($(/@help {*}))]%;\
	/if ({helplen} > 60) \
		/@help %{*}%;\
		/set TFHELP=%{tmphelp}%;\
	/else \
		/set TFHELP=%{tmphelp}%;\
		/@help %{*}%;\
	/endif

The setup of your own help file is quite easy. You can just look at the
TFHELP file for a really great example: Use & for keywords at the top
of the page and # to mark keywords of subparagraphs. New versions
use (raw) ANSI colour codes as well... - which is a pain when editting
with vim, but looks terrific in TF.

Based on this helpfile, you can automatically generate a .idx file
(%{TFRCHELP}.idx). A program to make these help-index files comes with
with the standard distribution; called 'makehelp.c'. It reads from
stdin and writes to stdout, so 'makehelp < tfrchelp > tfrchelp.idx'
should do the trick.

Ofcourse you may. Anybody may use it, change it, fold it, step on it,
set it on fire, delete it again, whatever... Just remember you got it
from me first. And I hope you're not gonna ask that after every mail I
send to this list, cuz the answer will always be the same ;-)

I am posting this because I still haven't gotten an 
answer as why this is not working.

I downloaded the percompiled cygwin.dll from coolview (Sergy patches)
replaced it with the cygwin.dll that came with 
tinyfugue. I was told that this .dll has the scrollregion fix
but this is not so ? I haven't been told if tinyfugue needs
to be recompiled to use the new fix. I have tried the following
in tinyfugue to prove that it doesn't work

/def x = /echo $[char(27)][18;25r

/set emulation=raw
/x
after this point lines 18 through 25 should only be scrolling
but this doesnt happen, nothing happens the whole screen continues
to scroll. Any ideas ?

Hi,

some months ago I published a little library called "lists.tf" which allows
easy handling of variables containing a "|" separated list of items.
I used them for global matching in triggers. Things like "if the guy who
just asked for a healing spell is in my list of especially friendly people,
then of course heal him" or "if the guy who just asked for a powerful
protection spell is in my list of evil killer-bastards, then don't grant
the spell to him".

I now wrote some more commands for these lists. One part deals with files.
With the new version you can append any change of the lists to a special
file (of course the filename is up to you). Next time you start tinyfugue
you can read all the lists without having to think about how to set them
up again.

The second part is a loop command like the /for command in tinyfugue which
allows to execute a series of commands where the loop variable goes through
all the items in the list. Except for the need of storing the list in a
variable first, this might even be interesting for those who do not need
the other parts of the lists-library.

I think there might be some of you who would like to use this code too,
so I'll post it here. Of course it's in my collection of tf code for
everyone who wants it (http://www.ph-cip.uni-koeln.de/~dittmar/tf).

;;; $Id: lists.tf,v 1.8 1998/01/22 13:26:54 dittmar Exp dittmar $
;;;
;;; coded by Susan Dittmar (dittmar@ph-cip.uni-koeln.de), October 1997,
;;; bigger changes January 1998

;;; I'll describe the usage of this little tinyfugue-library with the
;;; syntax of help files. This way, if you use your own help texts with
;;; tinyfugue (like with the /help command by Johan van Selst), you can
;;; just copy this part to your help file, you just have to remove the
;;; semicolons.

;;; The library requires tinyfugue Version 4.0 for the file handling part,
;;; the rest of the code will work with earlier versions too.

;;; &lists
;;;
;;; I wrote these commands to make some triggers much easier.
;;; The commands only keep track of variables which contain items
;;; seperated by '|'. These variables (lists) then can be used for
;;; global maching, like
;;;    /if /test {variable} =/ "{%{list}}" %; /then ...
;;;
;;; For each list there is a variable with the name <list>__count which
;;; counts the number of items in the list. If you only add and remove
;;; single items, this number will be up to date, else it can be computed.
;;;
;;; The variable _FILENAME_LIST will be set when this file is read if it is
;;; not yet set. It contains the name of the file where information about
;;; actual lists will be saved. This file can, of course, be changed.
;;;
;;; the commands are
;;; /addlist <list> <item>    adds <item> to the list if it does not exist
;;;                           yet
;;; /addlist <list>           echos the whole list
;;; addlist <arguments>       executes /addlist with it's arguments and
;;;                           writes the necessary commands to reproduce the
;;;                           list to the file _FILENAME_LIST
;;; /remlist <list> <item>    removes <item> from the list if it exists.
;;; /remlist <list> -a        clears the whole list
;;; remlist <arguments>       executes /remlist with it's arguments and
;;;                           writes the necessary commands to reproduce the
;;;                           list to the file _FILENAME_LIST
;;; /countlist <list>         counts the number of items in the list
;;; /changeListFile <filename>    changes the file for saving lists to a
;;;                           file called <filename>. In case such a file
;;;                           already exists, the new things will be appended,
;;;                           nothing in the file will be lost.
;;; /foreach <variable> <list name> <command>    executes a loop. In each
;;;                           turn one item of the list is assigned to the
;;;                           variable <variable>, then the command <command>
;;;                           (this can be a list of commands separated by %;
;;;                           if you need) is executed with this value of
;;;                           the variable <variable>
;;;
;;; #change
;;; #changes
;;; 5.1.1998:

Using the coolview patch this *does* work on NT, but not on 95.  Two things
to keep in mind.  Make sure you are using the correct dll, you may have more
than one, and the NT console itself tends to be a little odd, apparently it
works best once you resize it.

I have on cygwin.dll and I know its the right one since its over 600k
in size and not 500k I did a file find cygwin*.* and only
one file showed up.

Well I hate to tell you its not working. I did more tests ran TF
in a window and full screen changed back and forth and still no
luck. I even redownloaded the precompiled release unzipped and
then untared it,copied the cygwin.dll to \winnt\system,
then exit dosshell started it again ran TF and did the following.

/def x = /echo $[char(27)][18;25r
/set emulation=raw
/x

The whole screen still scrolls right after I type /x.
I am running nt sp3, I did the test I told you I did the test and
I am telling you it doesn't work. Maybe you should try the test
your self :)

I'm trying to adjust the number of lines that scroll by before getting a
'/more' prompt without actually changing the screen size configuration.
This is related to having trouble using 'more' with the 32 bit port of TF
that Andy Satori and Ryan Fitch-Davis are working on. Basically, the screen
columns/rows sizes are set  but, those numbers are too large for '/more' to
scroll properly. I cannot find a way to specifically configure the size of
the '/more' buffer itself in my .tfrc file, and thought it might be of
enough interest to others to request/suggest it as a future feature if it
dosn't already exist.

According to Ryan, if there is a way, it's not documented...and somone
needs to be advised of that too :)

Hi,

does anyone know how to suppress the reset of the idle() time on a tab key
press?
I'm running some robots on one of the muds I'm playing - but only in case
I'm idle. As they are not too sophisticated, I want to read the mud output,
and as I'm doing other stuff in another window, I need the /more feature.
All is fine with this except for the fact that pressing the tab-key (to read
the next lines) causes the idle() time to be reset. This means whenever I
have a look at the output, the robot will stop for 5 minutes before it
restarts it's work ...
Is there any way to scroll on (using more) without having idle() resetted?
If not, Ken, could you please add such a feature?

Susan Dittmar

Why not look at a different statistic, instead of idle()?  It sounds like you
want your robots to work only if you are unidle _in that world_, not in TF
in general.

So, why not take a look at the last time you sent something to that world?
Or the last time you entered a command into TF?

Which commands? Idle(world) is even worse, this world is never quiet, and
idle(world) counts output from the world aswell.

If there isn't an existing function for what you need, you can always write
one.  There is lots of information available to you via existing commands;
you just have to format their output into something you can use.

(Yes, sorry, I'm being deliberately vague.  I have written such a function
myself, though.)

Ok then this proves its the tf bin that I have that is making it
not work. So I have to wait until you release your next bin of
TF for this to work then I guess. Right now I am using your
last release. But I need one that has scroll region withen a months
time at least if its possible.

It is set. Someone else told me just replacing the old
cygwin.dll with a newone with fixes may not do the job.
he said that the TF in this case would need to be recompiled
with sergies patches. But eitherway it doesn't work. Everything
elseworks fine though, except for craphola scrollback support.
/recall # is not good scrollback very hard to use.
I would use the built in console scroll back but if I do that
it squishes the fonts in full-screen mode with is unacceptable.

Is it possable to have tf check more then one mailbox file for those of us
who have sevral for sanity? I'm going te be splitting off into even more
little files (or not so little) and it would be nice to beable to watch
more then just one of them...

Well, actually idle(world) is completely useless since it only measures
from received lines not sent lines.

Suggestions:

1. Send hook to keep track of last time you sent something.
   Disadvantages: your bot might set it off, only measures `sending to
   mud'.  Advantages: easy to have world specific idle times.

2. Rebind ^J to keep track of last time you typed that.  Disadvantages:
   only measures `pressing return' (can't tell local command from
   sending to mud), have to guess using fg_world() for world specific
   idle times (but usually it's right).  Advantages: bot responses don't
   have to use `/send' to avoid setting off send hooks, you could do
   this to a bunch of other bindings too.

3. Rebind TAB to keep track of last time TAB used, make a my_idle()
   macro which compares idle() and the delta from the TAB time.  If
   delta <= idle(), then it was a TAB.  Disadvantages: not world
   specific, tricky (but not impossible) to figure out "real" idle time
   when there has been a TAB.  Advantages: measures all typing
   except TAB, you could do this to other bindings too.

4. You can't use /recall -i 1, since tf will update the timestamp on
   "current" line before the macro is run.  This makes it mostly the
   same as idle().


I'd probably pick 2 as the most useful, since you probably aren't
"active" unless you've recently typed something.

The downside is that unless you use `/bg' doing things like `/expr
500+3' to balance your checkbook will count against your "idle" time on
that world.  Course you could work around that by just not reseting the
time if the input buffer started with with a `/'.  But then that
wouldn't count when you ran your `/eat' macro which did send something
to the mud.

Can you set the `LINES' environment variable to what you want before
starting tf?

Okay, I'm a *gasp* talker user (please no flames ;^)

One of the talkers I use has a tendency to randomly disconnect people
from time to time.  The talker is generally good enough that I'm
staying despite this.  But its name has been changed in the following
macros.  Macros first:

; Anti-disconnect hook
/def -wFooBar -hDISCONNECT reconnect_rr_FooBar = /retry FooBar
/def quit_FooBar = /undef reconnect_rr_FooBar %; \
	/send -wFooBar quit
/def -i -p1 -ag -mglob -wFooBar -h'SEND quit' \
	alias_call_quit_FooBar = /quit_FooBar

Soooo.... when I get disconnected, I should automatically reconnect,
unless I actually type quit on its own, in which case I should quit.
Unfortunately, typing quit doesn't actually cancel the reconnect hook.
Why, please?  And how do I fix this?  I've tried simple matching,
globbing against the (pattern identical, I think) {quit}, but to no
avail.  The third macro was lifted from expansion of an /alias
definition - I only want this to match for this world.

I will be a very happy spod if someone can help me with this.  Thanks.

when you type 'quit', the server disconnects you; since tf can't tell
between you actually typing 'quit' and the server bouncing you off it runs
the disconnect hook.
An easy solution is to just use /dc to leave, or alias quit to /dc if you
like.

Please re-read my macros.  What I'm trying to do is make quit undefine
the hook before sending the phrase 'quit' onwards.  I don't use '-q' as
I want to make sure that the hook is undefined before the 'quit' is
sent.

Thinking about it, I could use the first argument to the DISCONNECT hook
and test it with a simple /if, but this is clumsy.  Or do hooks not work
with a '-w' world, end of story?

Macros included again:
; Anti-disconnect hook
/def -wFooBar -hDISCONNECT reconnect_rr_FooBar = /retry FooBar
/def quit_FooBar = /undef reconnect_rr_FooBar %; \
        /send -wFooBar quit
/def -i -p1 -ag -mglob -wFooBar -h'SEND quit' \
        alias_call_quit_FooBar = /quit_FooBar

Thanks for any help.

It seems she is suggesting something akin to my old idler. Since
idle(world) was _not_ what I wanted, and that was the only thing
that existed at the time, I did the following:

	* First, plug into the send hook
	* At the hook,
		* Kill any process with a saved pid for that world
		* Remove pid
		* Save pid for that world in a global
		* Sleep for a time
	* After the sleep,
		* Remove pid
		* Do whatever you want

Code below. Beware, it's very old code, using very old syntax.

Hi,

thanks to all who helped me with this problem. Still any ideas are welcome,
here's what I am using now.

(To all who don't remember or who misunderstood me: I wanted to have a
function similar to the builtin idle(), but which does NOT count the
tabulator key as a sign I became active again. If called with an argument,
it does not, like the builtin idle(<world>) return the time since when there
has not been any activity in this world, but instead the time since when 
I have not been active in this world.)

;;; initialize the variable which saves when I pressed <return> last time:
/set _<wordname>LastNewlineTime=$[time()]

;;; set this variable again at each press of <return>:
/def -b'^J' b_Newline1 = \
    /set _${world_name}LastNewlineTime=$[time()] %; /dokey NEWLINE
/def -b'^M' b_Newline2 = \
    /set _${world_name}LastNewlineTime=$[time()] %; /dokey NEWLINE

;;; compute the time since last time when I pressed the <return> button:
/def myidle = \
    /let time=$[time()]%;\
    /let world=${world_name}%;\
    /if ({#}=1) /let world=%{1}%; /endif %;\
    /return $(/eval /echo - $$[{time}-{_%{world}LastNewlineTime}])
 
Btw, while testing this I found something which looks like a bug
in /return:
I first had a construction /if ... /return ... %; /else /return ... %; /endif
which always gave back the value of the comparision in the if statement and
not the value computed in /return ... !

I have some more information about the problems I'm seeing at login
using v4.0a4.  I set telopt=on and emulation=debug, and visual=off,
and tried connecting as usual.

Then, I fired up v3.5a20 and connected successfull using the same
settings.  I've included both sessions below.  Maybe this will shed
some light on the problem.

I've noticed that a lot of the macros posted recently (by many people)
are using `/eval' when it is not needed, in multiple places.  And
someday it's going to cause you problems.

> ;;; initialize the variable which saves when I pressed <return> last time:

> 
> ;;; set this variable again at each press of <return>:
> /def -b'^J' b_Newline1 = \
>     /set _${world_name}LastNewlineTime=$[time()] %; /dokey NEWLINE
> /def -b'^M' b_Newline2 = \
>     /set _${world_name}LastNewlineTime=$[time()] %; /dokey NEWLINE

I'd stick the time setting in another macro like `/reset_idle', and call 
that from the ^J ^M bindings.  AND, you most likely want a CONNECT hook
which also does the reset on that world.  Otherwise when you first
connect to a world, but haven't typed anything to it yet, you'd be
considered idle for ~28 years.

> ;;; compute the time since last time when I pressed the <return> button:
> /def myidle = \

>     /let world=${world_name}%;\
>     /if ({#}=1) /let world=%{1}%; /endif %;\
>     /return $(/eval /echo - $$[{time}-{_%{world}LastNewlineTime}])

/def myidle =\
    /return time() - _%{1-${world_name}}LastNewlineTime

There are a bunch of quirky bugs with /return and if/else statements,
also a few really neat ones involving /while when you're in a nested
macro call where the parent macro is in an if clause.  I think they've
been fixed for 40a5, but the best thing to do when you find a bug like
this is make a very small reproducable version of it, and send it in.

For example, your description above sounds like the following should
return 1 not `a':

/def foo =\
    /if (1) \
	/return "a"%;\
    /else \
	/return "b"%;\
    /endif

But it doesn't.  It works as expected in 40a4.  When it's not clear from
the description of the bug how to reproduce it, it's harder to fix it.
So the problem you saw has probably been fixed in a5, but without being
able to test your specific example, who knows.


For comparison, macros which set off a /return & nested /while bug.


/def tf_bug = \
    /if (1) \
        /tf_bug_%;\
    /endif


/def tf_bug_ =\
    /return 0%;\
    /while (1) \
    /done%;\
    /echo -e -ah BUG

Hooks work with -w.  The macros you give should work.  I suspect that
you either have multiple disconnect hooks sitting around, or your send
hook is competing with some other send hook.  You could even use the -q
on the send hook, since it will still run to completion before tf sends
anything to the mud (and long before the mud could close the
connection).

Remove the -i from your send hook, turn /mecho on, and watch what
happens when you type `quit'.

seems the more I use this software the more dumb limitations I run
into this time its with the upper 128 characters you know those
characters that allow you to draw lines. Well I did a test where I
was at the normal msdos prompt I was able to make them appear ther
but when I tried to cut and past some ascii lines into TF it
didn't work. So for some reason tinyfugue is not allowing upper
128 chaacters to work. I had emulation=raw so that no coversion
of characters translated. But that should matter because I pasted
a set of ansi lines char(205) this should of displayed a line on
my screen.

Yes, that looks far better, although I don't understand why it works ...

I'm about to write something like

   /if (${world_name}LastNewlineTime < time() - 10) ...

How would you write that? At the moment I'm using ugly code like:

   /if /test $(/eval /echo - ${wold_name}LastNewlineTime) < time() - 10 %; ...

Thanks in advance,

     Susan Dittmar

First of all: 
  Don't every use those stupid characters. No one uses them, they are not
  in any of the ASCII or ISO 8859-1 character sets, which are most used.

Second:
  Your problem is that you can't display 8 bit characters. This can be due
  to that TF is written for a real OS, and Win NT can't handle the locale
  thing. OR the compiled has been done wrongly. OR you haven't set your
  enviroment variables up properly for an 8 bit locale.

Third:
  Even if NT handles locale, the compile is done correctly, and you've set
  your enviroment right, it may STILL not work. Then it could be that you're
  not running TF 40a5. That's required for locale to work correctly under
  FreeBSD, for example. Only problem is, TF 40a5 haven't come out yet. :-)

I told you your possible problem(s). I'm affraid, though, that I can't
help you solve it since I'm fortunately not using WinNT.

I wish I could compile this my self but I cant since TF under
nt is more than just a recompile the authors that due change the
tf code its self then recompile it I dont have the slightest
clue how to change the TF code to make it work under NT.

So all I can do is post here and hopfully there is a solution.

I used to use TF under unix thru a shell account I could
use the upper character sets I talked about, even had flashing
ansi support.

Yes, it looks better, but - it does not do all I wish it to do. Although I
still would like to know why it works, the macro was intended to accept one
parameter when called and if called with this parameter, take it as world
name instead of the current world. I admit now that I retried using my own
version it does no longer seem to work (it worked, I tested it! sometimes I
doubt tf is deterministic ;-).

Would be, except for the fact I get better band with thru my cable
modem. Shell accounts suck compared to what I have now, no thanks :)

That is exactly what it does.  Note you have to call it in expression
macro-as-function syntax:

/expr myidle()           --> 10
/expr myidle("druid")    --> 5
/expr myidle(fg_world()) --> 0

/def -mregexp -t'yams' yams =\
    /if (myidle() >= 300 & bot_mode) \
	/send say ROOF!%;\
    /endif




Now how does it work:

One of the two things being used here are the fact that /return takes an
expression (ie same as /test), so we can just say things like `/return
time() - last_time' and have the correct value returned.

The other is how %-substitution works.  %{VAR} substitutes the value of
VAR.  But %{VAR-default} uses VAR if the value is non-empty otherwise it 
uses the default.  So `%{1-${world_name}}' means if %{1} is non-empty
use the first argument, otherwise use the current world name.

Well, I guess the third thing being used here is that because /return
isn't a special form (ie, not /if or /while) a level of substitution
completes before return is called.  So
`/return time() - _%{1-$world_name}}LastNewlineTime' gets treated like:
call `return' with arguments `time() - _worldXLastNewlineTime'.  Then 
this is exactly of the form in the first paragraph above, so it returns
the appropriate value.

Hi.

Someone asked me how to redefine the arrow keys and all in WINTF, but it
seems that NT has a strange idea of what to send when an arrow key is
pressed.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this? What bindings do you need, and what
codes are sent, etc.

Mad.

How can I get tf to select the first pure-alphabetical word from the input? :/
I am thinking it must be something along the lines of %Pn.

Any help appreciated :)

Hi,

I've compiled and run TF from this machine. I'm having a problem using
the SOCKS comliancy offered by TF. I usually use rtelnet to get out
and about, but running TF on a machine beyond the wall seems to
generate some terminal errors. (Things like prompts not being shown
until after you've answered them :-)

As a result I'm trying to configure TF to use the SOCKS server. Is
my problem simply clearing another port with the server? I know the
machine and port used for rtelnet, but setting proxy_host and proxy_port
to be these hasn't fixed the problem.

Using /def to define proxy_command to use rtelnet didn't seem to work
either. (And anyway, the help states you should use the SOCKS lib
instead of defining proxy_command).

I'm sure I'm missing something obvious, but the help files on the TF
web page and the READMEs haven't uncovered it for me. If any of you
have encountered/solved this problem, I would be very grateful to
hear from you.

btw - I'm using a SPARC5 running SunOS 5.5.2 and tf-35b4 [1]

cheers

rog.

[1] I did get tf-40a4 first, but ran into a weird set of compilation
errors on two different machines. These errors disappeared using the
same options in unix/Config in tf-35b4. (?)

Are you sure you're not doing something wrong with TF? If your MU* doesn't
send GA/EOR codes, you'll need to run tf in "/lp on" mode. Not doing so
will have the effect of getting prompts after you have answered them.

What kind of errors. It's always good to report that kind of thing.
The complete error message, output from uname -a, and what compiler
you were using. It might be something that's easy to fix, but not will
mever be fixed, because Ken doesn't know it needs fixing since it works
for him.

I just tried to compile 40a4 on this machine:
---------
myhost> uname -a
SunOS myhost.mydomain.com 5.5.1 Generic_103640-12 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-1
---------

It compiled with gcc:
---------
myhost> gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.5.1/2.7.2.1/specs
gcc version 2.7.2.1
---------

And it worked just fine. Not a single warning, even.

/lp on helps from the other machine, thanks. I'd still like to cure the
SOCKs problem this side of the firewall though. I wonder if being able
to rtelnet = being able to TF though the wall?

My compilation problems with Version 4..

[... blah blah blah...]

Aha!  THAT problem. :-) Ken has chosen to write a pretty neat macro for
a task in the code. It's most certainly a constant and it's a pretty cute
solution. I can't think of a way to avoid this problem without making the
code much less neat, right now. This is not TF source code error. It's a
compiler error.

However, this has caused more then one compilation failure, for more then
one person. Some way around it would be nice. I'll try and think of one.

If you can, I would recommend you to get a newer compiler. Preferably any
GCC version > 2.7.0. Then try again. The error is in your compiler not being
able to make a good enough optimization that it sees that the seemingly
non-constant expression actually evaluates to a constant. All that says
is that you should get a new compiler. :-)

Sorry.

Ok, this may not work, but its worth a try..
edit unix/Config
Go down to the `### Compiler.' section
Below the `## CCFLAGS="-g"' add `CCFLAGS="-O0"'

That should turn off all compiler optimization..
tf will compile bigger and a little slower however it just might work..

Hope this helps..

Is there any chance of using gcc?  tf has a few things that are standard C that
many compiler-provided compilers do not like.  It will compile just fine using
gcc 2.8.0, and several earlier versions.

From the looks of things - itself.  It works fine now, with "Nothing
Changed (TM)" ... must have been conflicts with earlier versions of
itself.  I'll add a -F flag to it.

Next time I have problems, I'll try to remember to start up an
absolutely fresh tf and experiment in that.  Sorry to have troubled
everyone.

Unix is not the easiest thing to setup. I run NT I use NT for games and
browsers and other things. I dont want to change OSs because TF lack
features from unix. But I know they can be fixed.

Using /test instead of () is the right way to go here, but you don't
need any of the $() substitution.


Why this is potentially confusing:
1. tf has two extremely different "kinds" of operation: normal macro
   expansion and expression.
2. if & while are special forms so do normal macro expansion slightly
   differently than "normal".
3. There are two different ways of using if & while which behave
   somewhat differently: `/if () ...' and `/if <commands> /then'.


It's good to think about what tf does as it tries to execute each line
of a macro.

In general, tf first goes through and substitutes all of the various
%{var}, $[expr] and $(/command) in a _textual_ manner to the end of the
command, then "executes" the real command.  The first half of this two
step process is called substitution (/help substitution).

However, there are 2 "special forms" which don't under go the same kind
of complete substitution before tf does more work on them.  Those are
`if' and `while'.  And the reason it can't do this is because it can't
know which parts are supposed to be executed or not that early.  So,
with `if' and `while' tf checks a condition and then begins doing the
same kind of normal substitution & execution on the lines of the
bodies.  This part probably isn't too confusing, since you do tend to
expect that if you have:

/if /mytest /then \
    /echo $(/foo A)%;\
/else \
    /echo $(/foo B)%:\
/endif

that `/foo' should only be called once with either A or B.



Ok, this example got huge, so you can skip along to the various sections 
starting with `-----' to get to the "answer" to the question, if you
don't care about this.  But then you probably don't care about the
answer either.

Linux isn't hard to set up. A friend has a distribution that takes up 16 megs
of disk space, and boot off of a DOS partation. All you do is download it,
pkunzip it, and type linux at a DOS prompt (Not DOS shell, but the real
thing). Then set it up for ppp/network access (howtos on the web, or ask
someone who knows like me), and install tf. Only takes about 30 minutes at
the most. (Not including download time for the mini-linu and the tf source
code)

If anyone would like more info on this please Email me directly at:
marlenem@neptune.css.swau.edu I'll give you all of the info you need to get
it, and set it up. 

Sorry, I know this is off-topic, but I couldn't resist throwing in my two
cents. :)

	Correct. (somewhat)

	Incorrect.  The 'cc' that ships with Sun systems are not, 
by default, ANSI compliant.  Since Ken writes ANSI code, a K&R
compiler will of course complain.  That's why gcc always works.

csh:
setenv CC acc

sh/bash:
CC=acc; export CC

	Rerun configure and you should be good to go.

Ok I downloaded the gnuwin cdk.exe installed it read the instructions
then I downloaded sergies patches , I had to guess what to do with them
since there was no docs as what to do with cygwin.dll and libcygwin.a
so I found the existing files and copied them over did the same
with bash.exe copied the newone over the old ones.
I figured sh.exe and bash.exe were the same so I copied over
sh.exe bash.exe. AFter 2 hours I still cant compile tinfyugue this is
what I get when I try it.

I figured if I compile it my self maybe some of the problems I been

OK,

Yes NT is a fully UNICODE environment, the CYGWIN.DLL that this 
relies upon, is not, no double byte character sets are supported.  In 
terms of drawing boxes using the ASCII, don't expect it to work.  
If you want it to work look at ANSI termcodes and character codes,
not ASCII.  

TF running under any flavor of Windows is NOT, let me reiterate this,
**NOT** an MS-DOS program.  Win32 supports a native Win32 Console
that is a full Win32 program and has the Win32 limitations, ie.  ANSI 
NOT ASCII.  TF runs as a Win32 Native application.  Do not confuse this, 
it'll get you in trouble EVERY time.

Yes, Support for the ASCII termcodes could be hacked in, but I'm not 
going to even consider it.

Lastly, the changes in TF to run on NT are nil.  It will compile right 
out of the box.  Some minor changes have been made by Ryan Fitch for
scrollback bugs, mine are for better use of the console and minor 
performance tweaks.  I'm also looking into possible workarounds for bugs
in the cygwin.dll.

Andy





First of all: 
  Don't every use those stupid characters. No one uses them, they are not
  in any of the ASCII or ISO 8859-1 character sets, which are most used.

Second:
  Your problem is that you can't display 8 bit characters. This can be due
  to that TF is written for a real OS, and Win NT can't handle the locale
  thing. OR the compiled has been done wrongly. OR you haven't set your
  enviroment variables up properly for an 8 bit locale.

Third:
  Even if NT handles locale, the compile is done correctly, and you've set
  your enviroment right, it may STILL not work. Then it could be that you're
  not running TF 40a5. That's required for locale to work correctly under
  FreeBSD, for example. Only problem is, TF 40a5 haven't come out yet. :-)

I told you your possible problem(s). I'm affraid, though, that I can't
help you solve it since I'm fortunately not using WinNT.

Well, maybe you should edit unix/Config like it said and see what relative

Seems I have made some progress but looks like I ran into a possible
bug in the compiler and if so how can I fix it ?

This is an alpha version, and so may not be fully tested on some
platforms.
With the new features comes the possibility of new bugs.  If you don't
want
to deal with this, get the latest beta version.

Ok I been doing a lot of playing around seems the main reason
why I am having so much probleems is text!=binary or vice versa
I found that if Switch text=binary most of the sh unixmke files
will work. Then it will errror at the gcc compilation part, then
if I set it back to text!=binary the whole compilation works
but sh unixmake install fails. So how did you people that compiled
tinyfugue get all of this to work ?

Hi there,

I want to define some triggers which get triggered by e.g.

Sister looks at you.

In this case I'd want do something to sister (e.g. spank sister), the problem
is, that I need the name in lowercase.
I didn't find a way to convert all to lowercase characters. :-(

Is there any way to get this?
Thanks for you answer.

Harry

Hi,

How do I store the result of a function/macro/evaluation in a
variable? I can't seem to figure this out from the documentation.
For example, I want to store the current time in a variable.
/time gives the current time, but of course doing
/set savedtime=/time will only put the string '/time' in the variable.


Thanks,

A friend of mine is looking for precompiled Win32 tf binaries, can
someone tell me where they've got them?  I know a few people here have
made them public, but I've of course lost the urls.  Thanks!

Try /set savetime=$(/time)

To get the value of an expression, use  $[], eg. /set savedtime=$[time()]

I think this will do what you want.

/def -mregexp -p1 -t'^(Sister) looks at you\.$' lower_it =\
        /send spank $[tolower(%{P1})]

I am sure there is a better way to do it, but that should
work.

When I'm logging -i (keyboard input), It discards muliple entries.

I'm trying to log a route, and when I type 's s s s w w w w n'
It comes out as 's w n' which is no good to me.
Can I turn this off or not ?

cheers

I use the following to map:
/require map.tf
to load the mapping commands and then
/mark
to mark my starting point...then every command that moves me is logged
including multiple occurrances....

To see the current path:
/path

use /help mark
after loading map.tf to see the commands that you can use....

BTW, I'm using 4.0a4 in case that makes a difference...

There's nothing the user can do about this, but it has been changed
in 4.0 alpha 5 (not yet available).

Maybe it has something to do with your /watchdog or /watchname...

Umm... quite bluntly put: You're not compiling on a unix machine, and I
wouldn't expect UNIXmake to work then, if I were you. :-)

Maybe there needs to be a win32make too, that is special to Win32 and takes
advantage of everything there, and stays away from unix specialities?

I think it doesn't have anything to do with it. I posted the same problem a few
weeks ago but didn't get an answer.
Moreover I could not solve the problem yet - even I took care about the watchdog
stuff.

Version 40a5 (not yet released) has a function that will let you scroll
an arbitrary number of lines at a more prompt.  But that is a side
issue.  Your screen size minus the size of the input window is by
definition the size used by /dokey PAGE.  If tf has incorrect screen
size information, then /dokey PAGE will scroll an incorrect amount.  If
tf is getting incorect size information, the best way to correct it
manually is to set LINES environment variable before starting tf.

If idle() were conditional like that, it would lose some of its usefulness,
and become more confusing.

To avoid having your bot set it off, you can
A. Have your bot always use /send, instead of implicit sends; or
B. Have your SEND hook reset the last_active_time only if (idle()==0), i.e.
   there was an implicit send and a key was just pressed.  (It's an imperfect
   hack: it can be tricked if your bot does an implicit send within 1 second
   of you pressing (for example) TAB.)

Or combine #1 and #2.  Bind ^J to /set last_return_time=$[time()], and have
a SEND hook reset last_active_time only if (last_return_time==time()), i.e.
there was an implicit send and RETURN was just pressed.  This eliminates
most of the problems with both methods.

But other keys typed within the same 1-second interval as the TAB will
be ignored.  That's no good.

If you use $(/recall -it /1 [^/]*) (with an appropriate %time_format),
you get the last real non-blank input line that didn't start with "/".

Anyone have a macro which would  take the following syntax:

/plus <variable> n1 n2 n3 n4 n5... ...nn

allowing n to be numeric or variable? I was thinking that an
implementation of a recursive shift would do wonders in this case...

Could similar macros be made for say /minus (recursive subtraction),
/times (recursive multiplication) and /div (recursive division?)... Anyone
have any good ideas how we can bring such macros about?

/def plus =\
    /let result=0%;\
    /while ({#}) \
	/test result := result + %{1}%;\
	/shift%;\
    /done%;\
    /echo %{result}


Note that I use `%{1}' not `{1}' this allows you to use variable names
in the call, rather than just numbers.

If you want an expression version, so you can say:
/if (plus(a,b,c,d,10) > 5) ...

Then use `{1}' instead of `%{1}' and change the echo to a return.

I've redefined the up and down arrows to do what ^P and ^N usually
do - ie move to the previous/next command - because that's what's
most intuitive to me.  However, that means it's very hard to move
around inside a long command like a description.

Is there a way to bind the up/down-within-this-command bits to 
control-arrows?  I couldn't figure it out ...

There is a way for defining what you want to a key that you like...

/def -b'controlcharacter-of-the-key' mykey = what-to-do-if-pressed

The easiest way to get the control character is to press the key you 
want to define in TF. Normally you get a string like ~[[24
But that is changing from terminal to terminal... this example is the F10
function key on my XTerminal :)
Just pressing the key and type in that string into the /def above... thats
it .

Trouble is, my up-arrow and control-up-arrow BOTH show up 
as [A when I type 'em :(

Yep, on most systems, there's no difference between 'up' and 'ctrl-up'.
You can however use the keypad keys in application or keypad mode
(they send different codes in either mode).
Note: This only works for the keypad keys, not for the extra arrow keys.

For this purpose, my .tfrc has the following commands.
(This is just a small part of it, I bind _many_ more keys).

;; application mode (default on most systems)
/def -i -b^[[A Up   = /dokey recallb
/def -i -b^[[B Down = /dokey recallf
/def -i -b^[OA = /Up
/def -i -b^[OB = /Down

;; keypad numeric mode (default on some systems)
/def -i -b^[Ox Num8 = north
/def -i -b^[Or Num2 = south

;; Toggle keypad numeric / application mode (works on some systems)
;; Other systems have a standard key(combination) to toggle the modus
;; On X systems, you can use xterm*appkeypadDefault: True/False
/def -i keypad = \
	/toggle keypad%;\
	/if (keypad) /echo -r \033>%;/else /echo -r \033=%;/endif

Can I get -any- modifiers (shift, alt, ctrl) to register on the arrow
keys?  Keypad's too far away :(

You can not, as far as I know. However you can make the bindings check
for a variable (if (do_recall) /dokey recallb%;/else north%;/endif),
which you can toggle with F10 or some other keybinding (/toggle do_recall).

TF sees only the characters, not the keys; and on vt100- and ansi-like
terminals (which is what I assume you're using), the arrow keys don't
generate different characters when modifiers are used.

I suggest a binding that uses another key before the arrow key, for example
ESC UP is ^[^[[A.

Maybe I am am wrong, but special definitions for arrows with
modificators may be done with X resourses. If you are using Xterm, you
can write something like this in .Xresources:

XTerm*VT100.translations: #override \
     None<Key>Up: string(0x1b) string("[A") \n\
     None<Key>Down: string(0x1b) string("[B") \n\
     None<Key>Right: string(0x1b) string("[C") \n\
     None<Key>Left: string(0x1b) string("[D") \n\
     Ctrl<Key>Up: string(0x1b) string("OA") \n\
     Ctrl<Key>Down: string(0x1b) string("OB") \n\
     Ctrl<Key>Right: string(0x1b) string("OC") \n\
     Ctrl<Key>Left: string(0x1b) string("OD")

This will make plain arrows generate ^[[ sequences and ctrl-arrows
generate ^[O sequences.

Actually, I am not sure if it will work. I did not test it and not
sure if I Ctrl is right. Maybe I should write Control? For meta
modifier I have just m<Key> definitions. I think all this could be
found in man xterm. Yes, of course only if you use xterm. I know
nothing about other terminal emulators.

Just an idea. If I wanted to make arrows with modifiers be different
from just arrows, I'd try this way the first.

Thanks for the pointer, but I don't use X.  My monitor's crappy and my
eyesight's crappy and these two things together make text-mode much
easier.  I just use Linux's VCs so I can do ten things at once anyway,
and only fire up X if I specifically want to run Netscrape.

You can do it yourself by sending mail to  <majordomo@tcp.com>
with the body:
unsubscribe tinyfugue

that should be enough for the majordomo to remove you...

same here... you know sometimes the meta (alt) key will work the same as
esc-whatever, so if you bind esc-something, alt-something will work as
well. (if you have %meta_esc on)

I want to make a macro /rebind that'll unbind a key then bind it
with whatever I specify, without giving errors if the key's already
bound.

However, you get an error if you -unbind- a key that isn't bound.  Is
there any simple way to gag this, I can't find a hook like REDEF for
it :(

forget that... /purge -b"whatever" works even better and doesn't give an

Go into /usr/lib/keytables/ (I think) and read the docs on the topic - I
think that there's a HOWTO.  I editing the keytable maps, you can
arbitrarily bind input sequences to keyboard presses.  The map files are
used to build up a grid, which you can visualise as a keyboard-press
per row, with various modifiers (shift, ctrl, etc) per column.  You can
arbitrarily rebind how the keys behave.  So if, like me, you like the
control key to be to the left of the letter 'A', where PC keyboard label
the key 'Caps Lock', you can switch the two and still have the light
work.  You could fairly trivially change the behaviour of control-up my
copying the default file, editing your copy, then using the 'loadkeys'
command, iirc.  Not sure that it's 'loadkeys' - something similar.
"man -k" is your friend here.

Sorry, but at the moment I'm on a Sparc running Solaris, so can't check
further.

I stumbled opon how to make this work totaly by accident. If you want TF
under
win32 console to support flashing ansi do the following. start an msdos
shell, go full screen (alt-enter) then run edit (this is a dos editor)
then quit it. now run tf as long as
you dont hit alter enter you'll have flashing ansi if you lose it just
run the 'edit' again.
I dont know how it works but it works.

I've altered /split in my settings by adding an optional delimiter (other
than the default '='), but I've noticed that if fed characters sensitive
to regmatch(), it barfs on them.

As my working knowledge of regexps is less than great, I'm curious if
anyone has an idea on how I could prevent this glitching.

I'm a little lost with this one, so I thought I'd ask the wisdom...
 
I've quite a lot of regexp triggers defined for replacing or highlighting
text. most notably a 'remember' matching descriptions to names.
They tend to be a quite a hog since they all have to be fall-thru and I'm
looking for a way to optimize them for better performance.
(I need to run tf on a sparc 10 - a poor sparc 2 is introducing quite a lot
 of lag to the thing...)

First: that's how they're defined right now:

/def -i split =\
    /let opt_d==%;\
    /if (!getopts("d:")) /break%;/endif%;\
    /let opt_d=$(/escape ^] %{opt_d})%;\
    /let pat=^([^%{opt_d}]*[^ %{opt_d}])? *[%{opt_d}]? *(.*)%;\
    /@test regmatch(pat, {*})

Of course this only works for single character delimiters.  Well you
could say -d'=:' and it'd stop at the first of = or :, etc.

The key here is to quote the ^ and ] which are meaningful inside []
forms.  And instead of quoting all of ^$|()[].*?+ I just put a [] around 
the central opt_d.  You could also just quote all of those characters.

you don't need the ,s in there... [Tt] and [Aa] work fine. And you don't
need to have the whole string in () either.

I'd say use globs and /substitute and /replace, but I don't know if that
will be faster...
/def -p1 -mglob -t'*the rugged green-eyed man*' = /substitute $(/test
replace("the rugged green-eyed man","Banquo",{*})
and
/def -t'The rugged green-eyed man *' = /substitute Banquo %-5

but that requires two triggers (because replace is case-sensitive
(insensitive?) hard to remember which is which, it cares about case)
if you only need to match the beginning of sentences, just use the second
macro.

Is there a way to insert a line into the input recall buffer
WITHOUT sending it to the MUSH?

I do online roleplaying and a lot of the time I'll be halfway
through a long pose and realize I have to type a short command
(say, +time) and see the output before I can finish.

What I do now is press start-of-line then 'Z' then enter, which
makes it an invalid command, type my short command, scroll back
up, remove the 'Z' and finish, but that's messy.

Ideas?

That would work, but it doesn't put it in the input history which is
what I wanted. 

I've nearly got it though, /recordline -i would work if only I could
figure out how to get the current input line as an argument to it ...

I was redoing an old script today and came across something strange and
annoying in tf 4.0a4, compiled under OS/2.  When using /echo -w, the line
refuses to show up on a /recall.  However, it *does* get logged properly
to a log created with -w.

Furthermore, the line apparently is present in teh buffer, though recall
won't show it.  When I do

/echo -w Hi.
/recall 3  (or recall -w 3 or recall -g 3)

I only get back the last two lines from the world.  It seems to know the
line is there, but won't show it.  The same is true for doing multiple
/echo -w and then recalling.  The lines /recall returns is equal to the
lines I ask for minus the lines /echo'ed in that range.

I grabbed the old 3.5b1 pre-compiled from the site and ran it, and got the
correct behavior.  I also ran a copy of 4.0a4 under Linux and watched it
run as it should.  Any ideas or fixes?

You could try to match it in a single pattern:

'(^[TtaAYsS].*he rugged green-eyed man)'

This would also match things like "...headache rugged green-eyed man",
but that shouldn't really be a problem.

You could probably also limit the beginning letters to ^[TAYS]

You should also consider collecting all your combat triggers in one
block and only turning them on as long as you really need them.
That way tf won't bog down the machine all of the time :)

kbstack.tf doesn't store it in input history, but it does solve your
example problem.  Type part of your long pose, hit ESC DOWN to push
it on a stack, type your "+time" command, then hid ESC UP to pop your
pose off the stack and back into your input buffer.

  $(/recall -i 1)
or
  $[strcat(kbhead(), kbtail())]

...but I don't see why you want to store it in input history.

Okay, the reason I want to store it in the input buffer is that is
where I am used to finding things, basically :)  I scroll up and down
it a lot, because I do coding on MUSHs and I'm forever having to type
a long command with just a few changes for the last time.

Also because I am a hacker (old def'n :)) and a pain in the next and
that was my first solution and I'm sure if I try hard enough I'll be
able to do it, so I'll dammwell find a way to implement it! :)

Also because I'm sick and one of the symptoms is minor brain fuckups,
and my fingers have -learned- up-arrow-for-something-you-typed-before
and I'd rather not have to retrain them.

Besides, *grin*, I've already GOT something mapped to esc-up and
esc-down!  (up and down are previlus-line and next-line, esc-up and
esc-down are to move around with in the current line, 'cause that's
less common).

Happy? :)

Basically:  Yeah, I -could- use the keystack thingy, I don't wanna!

Ahaa!

Nearly there now ...  (sick of me yet?)

I've figure out what I want is this:

/bind ^[^M = \
   /recordline -i $[strcat(kbhead(), kbtail())]%;\
   /dokey DLINE

Only problem, it won't let me redefine esc-enter.  I get an error

% /home/gossamer/.tf/keys, line 51: bind: '^[' is a prefix of an existing
   keybinding.

Yes, it's accurate, I have esc-up and esc-down defined, but I can
define this to esc-left or esc-j or something and it works.  Is the ^M
confusing something internally though??

Not sure what exactly's causing it, and I can't do a GDB on it unless I 
recompile with -g, but TF seems to be crashing on me.  I get the feeling 
it's due to history buffer overflow; it happens right when I receive a 
line of text, and the two TF processes in question had been running for a 
few days straight (though they connected and reconnected to different worlds 
multiple times during that).

Is anyone else having this problem?  Is there a solution (short of 
/quitting and restarting)?

Stupid me.. shows how long it's been since I've actually reported a bug in 
anything insteada just waiting for it to be fixed. :)

I'm running on TF v4.0a2, Linux kernel 2.0.33 (built under 2.0.31 with 
GCC 2.7.2.1).

 I'm wondering about a strange behaviour in TF I just noticed.. As I start
it up it takes 0:01 processor time. As time goes by, and text scrolls by,
the processor time gradually rises. I haven't checked how far it will go,
but after approx 2 hours of normal use it's already taking 4:00, and
constantly rising.

 Also, I've noticed that if you leave a TF process alone and cut the link,
it uses approx. 200-300 processor time after a day or two..

 Is this a "feature" I can affect in some way, other than restarting TF
every now and then, or is it just a plain bug?

 I'm using v. 4.0a4 on RedHat Linux.

Er.. 200 processor time? 200 what? Litres? And what's the load value at that
time, on your machine (check "w" for it, or so)?

>  I'm using v. 4.0a4 on RedHat Linux.

It could also be a bug in Linux, maybe? Most likely not, unless you see it
with other stuff too.

This makes sense... TF /has/ to be doing something, right?  And that takes
CPU time, which accumulates (that number is CPU seconds used since process
start).

Now, if the PERCENTAGE of CPU usage increases drastically, or the memory
size starts growing without bound, that's something to be concerned about.

Yes, regexps are a hog.

You could try and make a glob-trigger that scans the line and fires the
regexp one only if it matches. Globs are much less CPU-eating. But that
would require more programming (an extra trigger).

You could also bug Ken to make someting akin to PL and PR working with
globs. Substuting with globs is only possible if you know the position of
the string beforehand at the moment ... so one can use %{1} and so on IIRC.

Me thinks that you mean 0:01 as in "used 1 second of processor time since
started". And after 2 hours it took all in all 4 minutes (of the 120 minutes
aviable) in processor time. So that would be normal. Actually, that would be
very little.

ps/top/whatever you use

You say that it does some background activity (as in 2 or 3 minutes per day
or two). Hmmm. Now, that should not really be ... unless you have a slow
processor (then it can calculate less per minute) or it is in
doze/sleep/suspend/hibernate mode (the same reason). You are sure that your
tf is not doing anything? As in checking the time for at.tf or something?
And it is not connected to a mud?

That should be normal. How do other programs react? Xwindows should show the
same (only much more compared to an idle tf), does it?

 It seems I've once again succeeded in making a total fool of myself. :) 
Quite frankly, I don't have a clue. I'm at a total loss as to the
workings of Linux and I have no idea what it actually means. I _thought_
it meant processor usage or something (dunno what I really thought, so I
can't really explain it ;))

 The "time" I was referring to is the second last column :)

The TIME column is the cpu usage time accumulated over the life of the
process.  It grows over time.  Probably the most useful way to look at it
is to divide it by the amount of time the process has been running, and
compare it to the cpu_time/real_time quotient of other processes.
Accumulating 4:00 in 2 hours sounds like a lot to me, but I can't say
for sure without comparing it to other processes on your machine.

Next time, post the output of "ps u".  In addition to accumulated time (TIME),
it shows the start time (START) and percentage of cpu time allocated to the
process in the last time slice (%CPU).  For detecting how much cpu a process
is eating _right_ _now_, %CPU is more useful than TIME.  If your tf is not
supposed to be doing anything, and its %CPU is high, you have a problem.

 Every time you make a fool of yourself you learn something new. Ps u
shows the following:

Boco: (~) 5 *>ps u
USER       PID %CPU %MEM  SIZE   RSS TTY STAT START   TIME COMMAND
pude     14630  0.1  6.8  1504  1000  p1 S   12:07   0:00 /bin/login -h

 ..so 9.4% is what it took this time. Not that much after all. Thanks to

I found myself wondering if you ever finished that, Gossamer? It seemed like a
much simpler notion than making the keyboard stack random-access (a project
I've had on my rainy-day slate for a while now), which is in turn something I
find myself regularly wanting in the course of running half-a-dozen puppets
and a primary RP body. :D

In short, if you'd be willing to share... ;)

Actually, C is more useful than %CPU for "right now".

Sure!  I haven't made it bind where I want it (esc-enter) yet, so if
anybody can solve THAT one I'd be eternally grateful, but here's
what I have:

/bind [C = \
   /recordline -i $[strcat(kbhead(), kbtail())]%;\
   /dokey DLINE

Which binds it to esc-rightarrow.


It's nifty :)

Bizarre.  How come /def -b"" works for that but /bind doesn't??

	This is one that only Ken (or David) could answer fully,
but I'll give it my best shot. (ie, I'm pulling this out of my
ass so take it when a pound of salt)  First off, not that
I think it really matters, but what version?

	My guess is how input parser deals with different
forms.  /def -ib uses quotes, either single or double, whereas
/bind doesn't.  Possibly, the parser gets confused by the raw
control characters on the input line.  
	Somethign else, are you just typing ESC-RET in the 
input window?  You might want to try using the 'shorthand'
language.  ie, typing in literally "^[^M" instead of actually
hitting the escape key and return key.

	I've always been mistrustful of the /bind, /hilite, /trig, 
etc shortcuts, anyway.  /def is really all you need, and I've
never had a problem defining a binding, hilite, or trigger.

/help -q

Help on: /def: -q
  -q      Makes the macro "quiet".  If called as a trigger, the macro 
          will not count toward the BACKGROUND hook or the return value of 
          /trigger.  If called as a SEND hook, the macro will not prevent the 
          sending of the original input.  If called as a PROMPT hook, the 
          macro will not remove the text from the data stream.  
 
For more complete information, see "/def".

I have written a small trigger to catch some info
the syntax is : /def -t"{*} says {*}*" = /set var1 %1 5; /set var2 %3
so if for example : Marty says 'hello'. in var1 is string "Marty" 
in var2 "'hello'."
My problem is how to cut the last character from var2 the dot
i know that in C command var2[strlen(var2)]=0 will cut it, but i was
unable to find out how to amke it under tf.
Does anyone know how to do it ?

Try using regexps isntead:

/def -t'^[^ ]+ says ([^ \\.!\\?])[!\\.\\?]?' some_trigger= ...

The variable %P1 will contain the first word after "says", minus a
. ! or ? (optional).

Also, always name your triggers.

Well, thank you, I now have a running Win32 version of TF!  Yay!

Only one problem...  When I hold an extended key, (Any of the arrow keys, or
delete, insert, home, end, pageup, pagedown, etc...)  It will work fine for
a moment, then start putting up escape sequences into the line of text I'm
operating on.  It's like the TF loses a character, and then thinks the rest
is actual data I'm typing, not an escape sequence.  Anyone know how to
correct this one?  Does it show that I'm a newbie to TF yet?  :)

TIA again,
--Avocus

you can do:
substr(var2,0,-1)
but it might be just better to have the . at the end of the trigger, such
as -t"{*} says {*}*.'

This might be a bit of inexperience on my part, but would a gag do this
just as effectively on a wider scale though?  So instead of using -q in
all your triggers, simply gag the '% Trigger blah blah blah' string.  I'm
not sure if that would work as I'm not very often connected to multiple
worlds in a single tf session.  Most of the time I have multiple windows
running tf if I'm connected to multiple worlds.

I've got the same problem once. It was when I run tf via telnet to a
linux computer. Sometimes connection was bad and characters sent by
the extended keys could go with big delays. The target machine was
under linux, my under solaris. It happened not only in tf, but in vim
too. In any program that tires understand the extended characters.

I don't know how to fix it, just wanted to tell you that I had the
same problem and I think that there is no solution. Maybe it's a bug
or wrong implication in lynux or solaris.

Ah, by the way, if you don't run tf through telnet, then I may be
wrong.

In this case, "." means any character. Escape that if you mean
really dot.

The Win32 version of TF is compiled under GygWin32, which is in BETA.

(my appologies if this message got sent multiple times, been having trouble
with my connection)

One useful feature in zmud, one that a primary building block of bots and
such built in it, is trigger classes. What they do is allow a set of
triggers registered under class X to be simultaneously turned on and off as
needed, by using #T+ X and #T- X. I don't like zmud though but think it
would be neat to emulate such a feature in tf. I have a couple ideas about
how to do this and wanted to know what you guys think, and if anyone would
be interested in such a library.

One possibility is to use world_type to contain class info (assuming regexp
is default), eg:

/ADDWORLD -T"diku.myworld.autoassist.autocleric" ....

this would turn on diku autologin for one, and turn on the classes myworld,
autoassist and autocleric. You could then make libraries that would work in
different worlds and encapsulate your code better.

Defining triggers for such classes would then be very simple:

/def -T"autoassist" ...

would make a trigger in class autoassist.

You could even have triggers that require multiple classes to be enabled, etc.

But one problem remains is how to turn classes on and off when running
(which would be important for porting zmud scripts).

Making a set of functions to manipulate a comma separated string of words,
removing words, adding, etc would not be difficult, but how to change
world_type at runtime? Using /set world_type would work, but would probably
be very very bad and ugly. Would storing all info in an /ADDWORLD
definition, then rebuilding it to redefine a world at runtime be feasible?
Would that automatically update world_type at runtime for a world?

Another possibility is to build such a library using Susan's lists lib, and
have lists be classes containing names of trigger macros. Eg:

/def ... mytrig ...
/Tregister -c"autoassist" mytrig

Would that be more feasible?

Thanks in advance for any help.

how about just using naming the macros to have different classes in them,
such as...

/def -t'whatever' class1.macro1 = ...
/def -t'whatever' class1.macro2 = ...
/def -t'whatever' class2.macro1 = ...

and then use /purge to disable them and /load to load them back in (that
might get awkward though.) You can also try to do something with /list, but
its output isn't all that great for doing something with the listed
macros... maybe use /ismacro like

/let m=0%;
/while (m:=ismacro("-c100 *class1*"))%;
/edit -c0 %m%;
/done%;

that might take up lots of cpu time though, haven't tested it.

Is there a list of TF resources on the web somewhere? I have tried doing
searches, but most, if not all of the links are outdated.

Does anyone have some links or macros, etc they would like to
contribute? I could compile a list and put them up somewhere.

Okay, I'll give this one a shot.  How about using the function of
a defined world that lets you load a specific file on connecting to
that world?  This is done by simply adding the file to be loaded on
connection after the world definition.

In this file you could define all the seperate libraries, ie, files to
load.  Then just make sure you make all the /defs in these libraries
world specific by putting a -w attribute in them.  -w without any
world means the current world, right?

I'm not sure if this is exactly what you want, but, from my take on it,
it accomplishes it easily with tf's current functions fairly easily.

The official page is http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/ .

I put up a list of code on http://www.ph-cip.uni-koeln.de/~dittmar/tf/ .

If you have additional code and want it published there, send it to me.
If you want to copy my code (for the other authors' code you would have to
ask them) somewhere else, feel free to do so, just keep my name in them.

Try changing to \emx\lib (or wherever you've installed the equivilant
directory) and running "emxomf *.a".  Then change to the "mt" and "st"
subdirs in that directory, do the same, and trying make again.  Some of
the library files needed aren't in the correct format by default.

Thanks.  That was exactly the solution I needed to that problem.  Now I
just have to figure out how to get past the SYS1041 error/make error
255 after it processes regexp.  One thing's for sure...this is
definitely a lesson in reading code. :)  Any suggestions for a good gcc
tutorial?  I'm starting to think that learning how to make a program
with tf as the test case isn't the brightest stunt I've ever pulled...

What kind of mud are you looking for? Something more social or something 
more combat oriented.  I think there are some versions of TinyMUD family 
things ported.  (Though not necessarily supported).  And I know things 
like mordor have windows and unix versions also.

Is it possible to have a trigger/macro which is triggered in all worlds
except one (or named worlds)?

Okay. Here follows a small part of a macro, and maybe someone can explain
to me why it doesn't execute the /return 0..

/def calc_prot_falling = \
  /eval /if (%{2}_%{1}_TIME =~ "") \
          /do_echo %{1} on %{2} is DOWN in <unknown> sec.%%;\
          /return 0%%;\
        /endif%;\
  /eval /set %{2}_%{1}_LASTED=$$[time()-%{2}_%{1}_TIME]%%;\

What happens is the following: The /do_echo is done, and the return is
just simply 'skipped', and the macro continues execution with the next
eval.

+ /calc_prot_falling GREATER Splutty
++ /eval /if (Splutty_GREATER_TIME =~ "") /do_echo GREATER on Splutty is
DOWN 
in <unknown> sec.%;/return 0%;/endif
+++ /IF
+++ (Splutty_GREATER_TIME =~ "")
+++ /THEN
+++ /do_echo GREATER on Splutty is DOWN in <unknown> sec.
++++ /IF
++++ (!getopts("lpsx:", 0))
++++ /ENDIF
++++ /IF
++++ ((REPORTING =~ "local") | (opt_l))
++++ /THEN
++++ /echo -wzombie -aBCgreen % Zombie % GREATER on Splutty is DOWN in 
<unknown> sec.
% Zombie % GREATER on Splutty is DOWN in <unknown> sec.
++++ /ENDIF
+++ /return 0
++ /eval /set Splutty_GREATER_LASTED=$[time()-Splutty_GREATER_TIME]%;/if 
((Splutty_GREATER_LASTED < Splutty_GREATER_MIN) | (Splutty_GREATER_MIN =~
"")) 
/set Splutty_GREATER_MIN=%{Splutty_GREATER_LASTED}%;/endif
+++ /set Splutty_GREATER_LASTED=887383647

That's the debug output. I'm totally lost.

Version of TF is 4.0a4, running on Linux i86.

At Susan's page, I found the tabbing.tf script, originally written by
Kotivuori Nuutti. It didn't work right on my system, so I rewrote it.
Now I have one problem.


I use keybindings to walk through my 'tell history', and it puts "tell
<>" in the input screen. Only problem I have is: How do I get a blank
space behind the name??? (like: "tell foo " in stead of "tell foo") I
tried it using /input and char(), and it works fine for several
characters, but not for spaces. Anybody got a clue ?

these are the involved lines:

/purge -b'\033[[][AB]'
/def -b'\033[A' tk_keyforwardname  = /grab tell $(/tk_getforwardname) 
%;\
    /input $[char(32)]
/def -b'\033[B' tk_keybackwardname = /grab tell $(/tk_getbackwardname)
%;\
    /input $[char(32)]

Try adding a /then on the first line of your macro:

/eval /if (%{2}_%{1}_TIME =~ "") %%; /then \

I didn't actually try this out but I imagine that's what the problem might
be.  Also, you shouldn't need the /eval on the /if statement either, so
maybe make it look like this:

/if (%{2}_%{1}_TIME ~= "") %; /then \
   /do_echo %{1} on %{2} is DOWN in <unknown> sec. %;\
   /return 0 %;\
/endif %;\

Hmmm. How would that make a difference? TF adds one itself (as you can see
in the debug output)

Actually. I do need a /eval there. I have to make the comparison of the
variable created by %2 and %1 (So for example 'Splutter_GREATER_TIME'),
with an empty string. Try it without eval, and behold the errors. I
haven't found any other way to do anything with this.

If you give all the worlds you want it triggered in a certain type,
you can use -T when you define the trigger.  Example:

/addworld -Tfoo world1 1.2.3.4 5000
/addworld -Tfoo world2 6.7.8.9 1000
/addworld -Tboo world3 5.4.6.7 3000

/def -T'foo' -t'*some text*' foo_trig = some command

This trigger will be active in worlds 1 and 2, but not 3.  This is the
only way I know of to specify ("name") worlds for the use of triggers.

On tf 4.0a4 (dont think it works with earlier versions, but I haven't
tested this) you can use something like /test input("bla ")
to get bla followed by and a whitespace in your input buffer.

In your example you could simply use /input(" ")

doh, guess I'm a little out of practice.  I just went and wrote a few
lines of code and I don't understand why it isn't working either- although
I suspect its something to do with the eval.  Doesn't look like you're
missing any %s though.

Here's how I would code the same thing (the reason I suggested removing
the /eval is because I usually use /if /test expression- didn't realize
/if (expression)  doesn't eval its arguments).  This worked fine for me: 

/def calc_prot_falling = \
  /if /test %{2}_%{1}_TIME =~ "" %; /then \
     /do_echo %{1} on %{2} is DOWN in <unknown> sec. %;\
     /return 0 %;\
    /endif %;\
  /eval /set %{2}_%{1}_LASTED=$$[time()-%{2}_%{1}_TIME]


Sorry for the confusion...

Heh. Still the question is, what the hell goes wrong there? Maybe Ken
would know something. And I kinda hate the /test method, because I think
it's very hard to read. This is one of the more easy constructs I have in
my macro's :) Putting them in /test macro's gets unreadable really
quickly.

Me.

Er... except for the -w option on def of course, but that only lets
you specify one world for the trigger to be active in.

You want to remove the double %%; at the end of lines 3 and 4. (And replace
with just %;)
Also get rid of the %%; from the final line - the last line of a macro should
not have a %; element.

That gives me an error about finding ENDIF's outside or inside IF/THEN
blocks and more of that crap.

These were only the first x lines of a whole macro.

Mad.

You have two options: use -T, after carefully defining world types:

define all the other worlds to be type "foo", and the other world to be
type "bar", and use -Tfoo in your /def
(You can also use glob or regexp matching on your -T option, depending on
which -m option you pick, or the value of %{matching}, if you choose your
type names so that you match on a pattern, but that's probably more than
you need for something like this)

or,

/def <options here> macro_name = \
  /if ({$world_name} =~ "name of world you don't want to run in") \
    /break %; /endif %;\
  <body of macro/trigger here>

You will still get a "trigger in world <foo>" message though, if you didn't
use the -q flag in the /def.  (And the text will still highlight, if you
used -a or -P.)

The /return is not skipped; you can see it in your mecho output (after the
expansion of your /do_echo macro).  The thing is, /eval is creating an
extra macro evaluation level (as you can see from the number of '+'s), and
/return is returning from that level, not the level of /calc_prot_falling.
In the mecho output, you can see it execute the /return at +++ level, skip
the rest of the /eval body (i.e.  the /endif) that would normally occur at
the +++ level, and resume at the ++ level above it.

Your use of %%; and %; is consistent with your use of /eval, but your
use of /eval is the problem.  You should either wrap the whole body
in /eval:

  /def calc_prot_falling = \
      /eval \
          /if (%{2}_%{1}_TIME =~ "") \
              /do_echo %{1} on %{2} is DOWN in <unknown> sec.%%;\
              /return 0%%;\
          /endif%%;\
          /set %{2}_%{1}_LASTED=$$[time()-%{2}_%{1}_TIME]%%;\
          ...

or use /test in the /if, since it causes the extra evaluation you need
in the condition:

  /def calc_prot_falling = \
      /if /test %{2}_%{1}_TIME =~ ""%; /then \
          /do_echo %{1} on %{2} is DOWN in <unknown> sec.%;\
          /return 0%;\
      /endif%;\
      /eval /set %{2}_%{1}_LASTED=$$[time()-%{2}_%{1}_TIME]%;\
      ...

In the latter case, I might also use /test to set the LASTED variable,
and avoid /eval altogether:

      /test %{2}_%{1}_LASTED := time() - %{2}_%{1}_TIME%;\

Not with /log, but you can open your own file with tfopen() and make triggers
that use tfwrite() to write to that file.  See: /help tfio.

Hmmm, perhaps we could see expanded functonality of /log?
Perhaps redo it as a /def now that operates on the streams? (=:]

Ok, repeat after me (everyone).  ``I shall never use /eval except when
absolultely necessary, cause one day it'll burn my butt.''

/def calc_prot_falling = \
    /if /test %{2}_%{1}_TIME =~ ""%;/then \
        /do_echo %{1} on %{2} is DOWN in <unknown> sec.%;\
        /return 0%;\
    /endif%;\
    /set %{2}_%{1}_LASTED=$[time()-%{2}_%{1}_TIME]


If you still have problems, it's likely because you're calling
calc_prot_falling from inside a while loop or such in a parent macro,
and you're hitting the return bug.  But most likely it's cause you used
all those uneeded evals, and the return is returning from the eval not
the macro.

Putting in /eval makes them more unreadable, and is causing side effects 
you may not expect.

There was a big posting about how /if works and why you need /test or
not and how tf substitution works a couple weeks ago.

I will use eval a lot, since /test drives me bonkers :)

>     /if /test %{2}_%{1}_TIME =~ ""%;/then \

Okay. Is this supposed to be readable? :) Sure. It works, but if I want
around 70% of my lines evalled, it gets really obnoxious to put tests
around everything. The latter part of this macro consists of one eval and
about 20 more lines of code, of which 18 need those evals. That's the
reason I use evals.

Mad.

Which of course may lead to unexpected results some day when %{1} or
%{2} have any special characters in them.  Luckily in this case you know 
they have to be restricted to the set of valid variable name characters
to work, but it's a bad idea anyways.

Especially since the difference in behaviour between the /eval and the
/test version when called with `/calc_prot_falling $(/quit) hi' is
rather different.  Presumably you want the /test version which complains 
about a bad variable name, not your tf quitting.

/test is useful here since it avoids the $[], but even if you do use
/set, you don't need the eval.

Then your code will continue to break until you understand how /eval
works.

Yes, but you're evaling 90% of your code twice, which obviously is not
what you want.

If you have to do a lot of fetches and sets of things like
%{2}_%{1}_foo, use helper macros.

/def get_field =\
    /return {%{1}_%{2}_%{3}}

/if (get_field({2}, {1}, "TIME") =~ "") \
    /stuff%;\
/endif

/if (get_field("foo", {3}, "BAR") =~ "hi") \
    /echo -- %3 was hi!%;\
/endif

etc

You can also easily make get_field support any number of arguments, and
you can write a similar set_field if it'll make your life easier.


This may give you ideas.

You might find a lot of your questions on this list will go unanswered,
then. :)

It is perfectly readable, if you fool around with the spacing and layout a bit:

     /if /test %{2}_%{1}_TIME =~ "" %;\
     /then ....

And you can always add lots of comments in your code with ; as well.

I'll bet you a hundred of your local currency that most of those 18 lines
in fact do NOT need /eval at all.  If you are finding you need eval so
much, chances are high you are either doing something wrong, or there is
another (easier, and simpler) way of doing the same thing.

No, I didn't lose.  There are many other ways of getting multiple
substitution levels into a macro, without using /eval, that are safer.

Not at all.  I do that all the time, without /eval.

Take another look at David Moore's posting about accessor functions and
database handlers.

Hmm. I got Ken's explanation, but the helpfile about /return states:

  /return stops execution of the macro body that called it, and causes the
macro to return the value of <expression> (which can be any type, not just
integer).  If the <expression> is omitted, the return value of the macro
is the empty string.

Do I miss something here, or isn't it supposed to return from the macro
body? *scratch*

Mad.

Yes, that's a little unclear.  An /eval is basically the same as a macro 
execution, which is why it has some other strange effects (other than
the earlier discussed substitution problems).  Think of

/A%;\
/eval STUFF%;\
/B

as

/A%;\
/def temp_macro = STUFF%;\
/temp_macro %*%;\
/undef temp_macro%;\
/B

Ie, when you're in a /eval, it's basically like an unnamed macro with
the same args as you had.  So /return returns from the /eval, not the
macro.

You can't currently emulate all of /log's features in the macro
language, although you can get close for a lot of the common usages.

But you can certainly write your own /mylog which supports what you
want.

This past week or so I've been moving from tintin++ to tinyfugue.  So far 
I've been impressed with tf, it's very nice.  I won't miss having to add 
code to tintin++ to make it do what I want.  But anyway, I've got a 
couple of questions:

I would like to use ansi_attr emulation mode, but I want ansi formatting
codes (such as cursor movement and screen clearing) to be interpreted.  
Currently when I use ansi_attr some online editors I use don't format 
properly because of this.  I definately want to stick with ansi_attr mode 
though, because of it's added functionality over raw mode.

The help for /for gives "/for i 0 9 say $[10 - i]" as an example, but 
when I do that it outputs "say 10" 10 times.  What's the deal?

from /help eval:

  <Command> is evaluated as if it were the body of a macro: it goes through
  substitution, and is executed in a new scope.

/return _does_ return from the macro body, but when you use /eval, the
active macro body is the one defined by the /eval.

1.  If you log the global output (ie /log ~/foo), it stores lines as
they come to the foreground, not as they arrive.

2.  You need to store lines like `---- World cave ----' in a global log, 
and /recall output, etc.

3.  The more general case of this is that you need to store output sent
to worlds via all sorts of means, such as /echo -wfoo.  This is often
done even to non-connected worlds.  You can't just wrap /echo, since
the echo() function and builtin output should be recorded also.

4.  Currently lines are recorded to the log file after all
triggers/highlights/etc are run on it.  A high priority trigger reverses 
this and may change the behaviour of some macros.  Various people turn
on logging automatically via trigger, and this would break things for
them.

5.  If you try to work around problem 4 by delayed operation, and using
/recall to figure out what to log, you will miss lines that are -aG.
And it still doesn't fix all of problem 2.  Number 3 would still cause
problems since you'd have to keep scanning background worlds, and you
couldn't do it fast enough not to break certain macros (although you
could override /quote, /sys, /sh, etc to help lower the chances of
breaking them).

That example is for at the command prompt AND you must have /sub not set
to full.  Otherwise you have to do: /for i 0 9 say $$[10 - i]

This isn't quite what you meant, but one way I control triggers is to
define worlds like this:

/addworld -T"tiny.mush.mg"       tc   x     xx changeling.real-time.com 6250
/addworld -T"tiny.mush.mg"       mg   finn   xx fiend.enoch.org     9999
/addworld -T"tiny.mush.sd"      sder   erin     xx zen.mudservices.com 1976
/addworld -T"tiny.mush.sd"      sdky   kyle     xx zen.mudservices.com 1976
/addworld -T"tiny.mush.sd"      sdru   ruth     xx zen.mudservices.com 1976
/addworld -T"tiny.mush.sye"     sye     charade  xx  203.4.148.2      9999
/addworld -T"tiny.mush.sye"     syefr   friday   xx  203.4.148.2      9999
/addworld -T"tiny.mush.sye"     syerb   rb       xx  203.4.148.2      9999

So each world has a different type.

I discovered by trial and error that macros defined for tiny.mush
still work with tiny.mush.*.  And then I can define macros for type
tiny.mush.sye, or whatever.

That's a lot more useful than defining macros for a particular world
name if (like me!) you have multiple characters (and therefor
worldnames) per world.

You must have sub=full.  I recommend leaving sub=off, because most of the
time you probably don't want %, $, etc. to be interpreted.  In those cases
when you _do_ want evaluation, stick /eval at the beginning of the line,
or define a keybinding like the one below to let you evaluate a line by
hitting ESC RETURN.

  /def -b'^[^M' = /sub full%;/dokey newline%;/sub off

It can't be done.

I have the following macro, which repeatedly executes the first
argument, supplying it with each of the following arguments:

/def doforeach =\
	/let mac=%{1} %;\
	/shift %;\
	/while ({#}) \
		/eval %{mac} %{1} %;\
		/shift %;\
	/done

Now "/doforeach /myfunc foo bar wibble" works, as does something which
just involves a single word.  I don't want to move to lambda functions
with a named variable.  But the problem...

How can I define an anonymous function on the command line?
Stylistically, I want to do something like the kind-of-obvious idea
in:
/doforeach 'tell %{1} foo' alpha beta gamma
which I know is way wrong, but how /should/ I be doing this, please?
Other than defining, then calling /doforeach, then undefining a
temporary macro?

Any help gratefully received, thanks.

you know that /mapcar in lisp.tf does the same as that /doforeach you
posted above, right?
why not just put it in a variable first rather than making a macro?
You can't split it up by positions of 's unless you used getopts() which
seems the way to go.

Try this:
/def doforeach = /if (getopts("c:")) /while ({#}) /eval %{opt_c}%; /shift%;
/done%; /endif

then you can try something like /doforeach -c'tell %{1} foo' alpha beta gamma

the c is completely arbitrary ("command"), cause I couldn't think of
anything else that doesn't sound like another option.

David,

could you please add to your database code some comments what the stuff is
meant to do? Of course I could invest some hours reading it line by line,
checking the meaning of all commands you use and figure it out myself.
Still I'm sure it's much less work if you write one or two lines about the
main purpose of this set of macros.

I'm curious, where does the name tinyfugue come from? The musical
definition or the psychological one? Or something altogether different?

Sleep deprevation makes me wonder silly things-

Hi ! 

This is probably a quite trivial problem, but I did
not managed so far to solve it with the help of the documentation: 
How can I execute a command and suppress the following output on the
screen ? But Of course, I want to evaluate the output and react to it.  

Bye, Bye, Stratos Tsantilis

Heya gang,

I was wondering how to do this. What I want is for TF to set the Xterm
titlebar to be 'Tinyfugue: ${world_name}' whenever I change worlds. Is
there an easy way to do this? I can go in and edit the bindings for esc-f,
esc-b, and esc-w, but not /world, /connect, /fg, or /bg. Help?

Jamie

Make a trigger based on the output and gag it with the -ag attribute.

I noticed some discussion on the list about regexp matching, and how it is
supposed to be slower/less efficient than other matching. I saw mention
that regexp matching actually slows things down.
How much should someone with just a few matches worry about this? For
example, I had the following set of matches (I use global matching by
default):

/def -p2 -aBCblue -t'{*} multipages*' hilite_mpage2
/def -p2 -aBCblue -t'{*} multi-pages*' hilite_mpage3

I replaced them with:

/def -p2 -aBCblue -mregexp -t"(multipages|multi-pages)" hilite_mpage

Would the two global matches still be faster and more efficient than one
regexp match?

Another example:

I started with this:

/def -w'ss' -p1 -abCgreen -t'* the scanner light shows green*' scanner_green
/def -w'ss' -p1 -abCgreen -t'* the autopilot light shows green*'
scanner_green2

I ended up with this: 

/def -i -w'ss' -p2 -abCgreen -mregexp -t"(scanner light shows
green|autopilot light shows green)" scanner_green

Am I actually slowing TF down by doing this matching? I assumed 1 regexp
match would end up being more efficient than 2 global matches...

The issue is not that the match type is regexp, but how complicated it
is.  With regular expressions you can have very complicated patterns,
which are very loose at the beginning (eg. starting with .*) and very
complicated at the end, which can lead to O(n^2) time doubling back to
the beginning of the regular expression, as each test string matches or
doesn't match at the end.

The only difference you've got between these two is that the first (glob
matching is short for globular, not global) is not case-sensitive,
and will only allow one word between the multi word.  If you want a
regexp that's closer to the glob, use:

-t'^[^ ]+ (multipages|multi-pages)'

and you can simplify this to  -t'^[^ ]+ multi-?pages'

No, you are slowing TF down by just a tiny wee bit with these regexps, as
they are simple and don't have lots of .* and parentheses (multiple possible
paths, each of which must be tested).

Again, you can simplify down to  -t'the (scanner|autopilot) light shows green'

As you write a trigger, generally it's pretty cut and dried which matching
style you have to use.  If you can get away with the simplicity of globs,
and case-insensitivity is okay, always go for the glob.  Likewise, if you
can use -msimple, use that when you can too.

As an example of some more complicated, multipath regexps:

  -t'^([Gg]ive me a )?([Qq]uot(e( for| by| from)?|ing)|\
  [Tt]idbit for|([Dd]irt|[Ss]cuttlebutt) (on|for)|[Ss]lag) ([^ ]+)$' 

  -t'^[Hh]ow (many|much)( [\'"]?(.*[^\'"])[\'"]?)? \
  (quotes|tidbits|scuttlebutt|hearsay|dirts?)\
  ( do you (have|know)|have you (got|heard))?\
  ( matching [\'"]?(.*[^\'"])[\'"]?)?$' \

These are complicated enough that they must go through a first pass via
a -t'*' trigger, to strip out the '^[^ ]+ says,? \"(.*)\"' things first,
before being /trigger -w into the world where the patterns above are
defined.  If you didn't understand what I just said, don't worry. :)
The multiple paths are just done for the sake of creating more tirgger
combinations, and for getting the benefit of more than the allowed 9
parentheses per pattern.

I ran into the following problem. I am making a bot and I want to have the
spell 'sanctuary' on me when I attack things. The way I am doing this is to
issue the command to check spell effects to the mud, and have a trigger set
the sanced variable to 1 if I am still covered by this spell. Then I can
check this variable to see if I need to cast it again or not... So it looks
something like this:

/def check_sanc = \
  /set sanced = 0%;\
  af%;\
  /if(!sanced) \
    /c sanc%;\
  /endif

Here's the problem, it sends the af command and then goes on its merry way
to parse the if, as I would expect, which at this point will be true in
whatever case since I did not wait for the mud command to finish. 

What I want to do is something like this:

/def -t'you are effected by sanctuary for...' = \
  /set sanced 1

/def wait_prompt = \
  /def -qFp2147483647 -n1 -hPROMPT = /set sanc_lock 0

/def check_sanc = \
  /set sanced = 0%;\
  /set sanc_lock = 1%;\
  af%;\
  /wait_prompt%;\
  /while(sanc_lock) \
    %;\
  /done%;\
  when done%;\
    /if(!sanced) \
      /c sanc%;\
    /endif

What I want to figure out is how to do the when done part, and if there is a
way to do that...perhaps by parsing the output of /ps in some way?

Thanks in advance for the help.
(hope I made sense, the world is spinning, withdrawl sucks)

You are quite close to what I think should work. If you define the prompt-
hook inside the macro to the /if (!sanced) clause, it should work:

/def -t'you are effected by sanctuary for...' = \
    /set sanced 1

/def check_sanc = \
    /set sanced = 0%;\
    /def -qFp2147483647 -n1 -hPROMPT wait_prompt = \
        /if(!sanced) \
            /c sanc%%;\
        /endif %;\
    af

I hope this helps ...

	Hi, I've got a question - with the keyboard buffer loadin, you 
can store a bunch of commands (I'm not sure what the maximum is) into a 
buffer to be called back later.  But what I'm looking for, is something a 
little more exotic.

	How would one code a buffer that, when you call from the buffer, 
for the first time, it brings the last thing you entered, but, the next 
time you call the buffer, it puts what it has currently, back into the 
buffer, and called the second last thing you entered.

	For an example, I type Hi, put it in the buffer.  Then type Bye, 
and save it in the buffer.  Lastly, I type and put, Foo, into the buffer.
	Now I have an empty command line.  I call from the buffer, and my 
command line becomes, Foo.  I call from the buffer again, and get Bye.  
Then I put that back in the buffer, and my command line changes back to Foo.

	Would that be at all codable, or am I living in a wonderful world 
or make believe, Mr. Dress-up?

I am not sure exactly what you mean... But if you type Hi<enter> Bye<enter>
Foo<enter> and are then on the blank command line, you can press CTRL+P and
the line will display Foo, press CTRL+P again and the line becomes Bye, and
then if you press CTRL+N the command becomes Foo...

Hope this helps.

Put the following anywhere in your configuration files, for example .tfrc

/def -b'^[[A'   key_up  = /dokey RECALLB
/def -b'^[[B'   key_down= /dokey RECALLF


Then you will be able to scroll up and down through your typed commands
easily with the arrow keys. It is a bit easier as using CTRL-P and CTRL-N
but does the same :))

Hi ! 

I would like to have a keyboard buffer even if I start a new
tf-session, i.e. I'd like to have the history 
of the last sessions, too .

Is that possible ? 

Regards, Stratos Tsantilis

from /help recordline:
-- snip --
  /Recordline can be combined with /quote to read a log file back into
  history.  For example, if you had created a log with "/log -i input.log" in
  an earlier tf session, you could start a new tf session and use

  /quote -dexec /recordline -i 'input.log
-- snip --

I dunno right off and don't have time to check on it now how to hook/def
things that are done when TF exits. Think /hook DISCONNECT and /hook SIGHUP
could do the trick.

So you do "/log -i input.log" on exit and "/quote -dexec /recordline -i
'input.log" on startup. Ofcourse we could put that DISCONNECT hook only in
use and put something like "worldname.input.log" which would be loaded upon
connect to the particular world.

But anyways, read the help, Ken has hidden lots of solutions there.

Hope this helps,

Using TF 4.0 alpha 4 under OS/2 Warp Connect, latest versions of fixpack, 
tcp/ip, emx, and gcc (sorry I don't have exact version numbers available).

It seems to crash randomly with a signal 11.  It sometimes happens when 
simply receiving text (with no text matching any triggers), or when 
loading files.  I can't find any consistent conditions occuring between 
the crashes.

A friendly reader of the list helped me with digging up more info that 
may be of use to finding this problem.

OS:  OS/2 Warp Connect (v3.0), Fixpack XR_W032 installed, and base TCP/IP
GCC:  gcc version 2.7.2.1

EMX : revision = 50
EMXIO : revision = 50
EMXLIBC : revision = 52
EMXLIBCM : revision = 52
EMXLIBCS : revision = 52
EMXWRAP : revision = 50

TF: 4.0a4, compiled using gcc/emx given above

Crashes with signal 11 (SIGSEGV).

The problem generally occurs when receiving large amounts of text 
(particularly if the connection is lagging some, and get large 
'bursts').  My connection is over Ethernet, through a T1 to Sprint, so a 
fairly clear connection, aside from Sprint never keeping their own 
network up and running well =)  Again, there is no 'recent' triggered 
text when the crash occurs.

Hopefully this info will help.

Hello all,
I am searching for something coded in tf commands for fast walking like
this:
/dorrun 4e,ne,5e,6se,.......     the macros dorrun should process
that and  send the right commands to the mud. does anyone have something
similiar maybe and could send it to me please ?

I have a trigger to scan in my hp bar and then echo it in another format.
The mud sends hp sp in different colors can i somehow read the color codes
with tf ? 
Also i want to echo the new changed hp bar in different colors what i have
now are many seperated echos, is there an easier way to do it ?

Erwin

All you need to do is process %* by splitting the string up, using , as a
token.  strchr() will do this.
Or, if you change the syntax to /dorrun 4e ne 5e 6se
then you can use the /shift macro.

Sadly, no.  You can see the different colours, if you have ansi emulation
set up correctly, but you can't interpret or trigger on the ansi codes
themselves.

> Also i want to echo the new changed hp bar in different colors what i have
> now are many seperated echos, is there an easier way to do it ?

Instead of /echo -a, use /echo -p (to output all your HP stats on one line,
in different colours).  Check the /help.

/load speedwalk.tf

Then just type 4e5e, whatever, right on the input line.  ne is a
special case however, but I think it allows for you change it around.

Hrm. or map.tf, which has something like /dopath, and I'm more sure
has a way to do northeast as ne.

Actually I do. The short version is something like this:

;; /walk <path>
;; use spaces or commas as delimiters
/def -i walk = \
    /let args=%*%;\
	/while (regmatch("^([0-9]*)([a-z]+)( |,|$)", {args}), {P2} !~ "") \
		/for i 1 %{P1-1} %P2%;\
		/let args=%PR%;\
	/done

(In fact I ripped this from a set of macros that go together in my .tfrc
 I'm pretty sure you it works when you have just this macro though.)

I used to have something for this, but I'm not sure if you still need it
(I never really use it myself ;-)

It goes something like:
/def -h'PROMPT ([0-9]*).?0m' reporting = \
	/echo HP: $(/esc %PL)

Where /esc is defined as:

;; Ignore colour sequences
/def -i esc = \
    /let tmp=%*%;\
	/while (regmatch("^[\[[0-9]*m", tmp)) \
		/let tmp=$[strcat(PL, PR)]%;\
	/done%;\
	/echo %tmp

> Also i want to echo the new changed hp bar in different colors what i have
> now are many seperated echos, is there an easier way to do it ?

Something like 

/echo -p @{Cyellow}foo@{Cgreen}bar@{n}!

will work with the latest tf version... Don't remember exactly when
this feature was introduced though...

/speedwalk does most of that already.  Just type /speedwalk to turn it on
(don't forget to /include speedwalk.tf in your .tfrc).  Then you can type
like a normal command something like 2n4e5n6w, or nneee etc.  The only
complaint /I/ have with it is that it doesn't do "angles", like se, sw,
etc.  However, not all MUDs have that, so it's never been a real problem.

Gossamer poured forth with eloquence the following:
> Is there any way to supress the ----- recall end ----- line you
> get with /recall?

From "/help recall":
  If the output of /recall is being sent to the screen, it will be preceeded
  with "---- Recall start ----" and followed by "---- Recall end ----".  These
  lines will not be produced if the output is redirected, for example with
  $(...) command substitution or "/quote `/recall".

So, unless you're attached to colours: /quote -0 /echo `/recall whatever

The /echo won't preserve ANSI colour attributes.

Okay, tinyfugue just bombed out on me.

I was typing away.  I think that the talker I use dropped the
connection.  My auto-reconnect started, and well:
-----------------------------< cut here >-------------------------------
Normal talker text
% Loading commands from DodgyCodeTalker.
% Connection to DodgyCodeTalker closed by foreign host.
main_loop: select: Bad file number
shellprompt$
-----------------------------< cut here >-------------------------------
The two '%' system lines are normal for when the talker drops the
connection.
% TinyFugue version 4.0 alpha 4 sub PDPP.
% Copyright (C) 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 Ken Keys (hawkeye@tcp.com).
% Added nsockets function
% Built for SunOS Generic_103640-03 5.5.1

The addition doesn't affect file-descriptors at all -- I've mailed the
relevant patch to Hawkeye (but received no ack) some time back.  That's
just something to allow me to efficiently shove the number of open
sockets into my statusline.  It's an added counter and goes nowhere near
any file descriptors.

Really, this is not much use as it stands, unless someone else has seen
this, in which case it may be useful verification of the existence of a
bug.

Hope this helps someone.

If you want to get the number of sockets you could use (like nactive()):

/def nsocket =\
    /listsockets %| /return %?

Although that will count "dead" sockets that you haven't yet read stored 
lines from.

You could also easily use CONNECT/DISCONNECT hooks to raise/lower a
counter of the number of alive worlds.

The comment about -i (keyboard buffer) causing coredumps is no longer
true in recent tf versions.

Hi!

One simple question:

How do I get the name of the world in foreground (not the current world)?


Thanks, Stephan

Many thanks.  I tried variations, but couldn't succeed in just sinking
the value.  But I wanted a value which could be referenced trivially,
without needing to go through so much dead-weight, give that it's in my
status-line ...

But that's a much better idea.  I'm not sure why I didn't think of it.
Other than me being stupid.

But the patch does NOT affect the files-descriptors -- the local sub
patch is irrelevant as far as that bug is concerned.  I know what I
changed to introduce that primitive variable.

/help worlds   ->   ... See also: sockets
/help sockets  ->   fg_world() - name of foreground world

You have to use it in expression context.

So:
/def foo =\
    /echo FG World is $[fg_world()].

Or:
/def bar =\
    /if (fg_world() =~ ${world_name}) \
	/echo Bar run in the fg world.%;\
    /else \
	/echo Bar run in some bg world.%;\
    /endif

Darnit.  I'm -very- attached to colours.  I can't read the

No, the lack of flushing in tfwrite() is a bug.  The next version will flush
each line automatically.

Ok I am going to ask this again. Both tinyfugue on my old unix shell
account which
I dont have anymore and tinyfugue on NT both do the same thing sometimes
for
reasons I dont know a line of text that has different colors in
sometimes the whole
line will pick up the one color example.

This is a cool line   status  level 89

Now say this above line is in a list of 20 repeated 20 times.
Now lets say "This is a cool line" was in white
"status" in red
"level 89" in green
now what will happen sometimes is "This is a cool line" will turn red
the
color of what "status" is, so the color bleeds out to the rest of the
line.
I call this a bug because if I telnet to the mud I play on with a CRT
that has
ansi this never happens. So maybe kenkeys knows what this problem is
in the past no one has even noticed it maybe you have and never said
anything anyways its very annoying and hope it gets fixed.

Oh by the way this problem has been like this for over a year.

To say it short, I don't believe you :)

Perhaps you made the example different from the real thing or something. If
it was that the 'this is a cool line' part would be green sometimes or it
would be red and the 'level 89' part on the previous line would be red too
it would be explainable.

So if the line the mud sends lines like this (emulation=debug):
^[[0mThis is a cool line   ^[[31mstatus  ^[[32mlevel 89^M
^[[0mThis is a cool line   ^[[31mstatus  ^[[32mlevel 89^M

the beginning "^[[0m" which actually comes at the end of the previous line
may be seen as lpmud-prompt (it _IS_ an unterminated line and if we are
very strict about the protocol, it should be treated as a prompt too) and
such may result for the color on the previous line not to be terminated and
"bleed" on to the next line.

This behaviour is "wrong" from the mud side: it should send "...level
89^[[0m^M" instead of "...level 89^M^[[0m".

But, as I said, if your example is really exact and it bleeds just the way
you said, I don't think that's possible by any means.

One very plausible explanation would be the prompting thing. But if you
could give a _real_ example of a line gotten from the mud with
emulation=debug we could probably diagnose the problem with more ease.
(IMHO, there is no way a color can bleed backwards in text if the previous
line has a different color.)

Hi there!

After the nice thread about /eval and /test a few days ago, I'm trying to 
replace as many /evals as possible with /test.

My problem is the warning "% test: warning: variable 'var' was not
previously defined in any scope, so it has been created in the global
scope." after a line like "/test var := 3". 

Is there any way to avoid this warning _without_ creating the variable
before? 


Thanks, Stephan

Here's my experience of compiling tf version 4.0 alpha 4 under gnuwin32
beta 19 on windows 95, using the updated for b19 coolviews .dll (which
should have nothing to do with compiling but just mentioning it). I have no
mount table what so ever, and have no idea how it should affect or
shouldn't affect compilation.

I changed unix/Config to install in /usr/local... set make to make --unix
just in case (yes I tried it both ways, and yes I used cygnus.bat to set
the environment) set term to hardcore vt220 and tfconfig ran like a champ,
but when I got to the make part things started not going so well. At first
I tried to change unix/Config and even unix/tfconfig around but that turned
out not to be the problem.

Whenever unixmake got to the actual make part, it would spit out:

make: *** wait: Invalid argument.  Stop.

I then went to src and tried running just "make".

At first, it it spit out the same error, then it started making a file or
two, and then spitting that error out again.

I got bored of typing make all the time and wanted to see what would happen
so I made a little script and ran it in the src dir:

temp.sh:
------------------------
make
while [ $? != 0 ]; do \
  make;\
done
------------------------

Make kept chugging on and barfing out the same error here and there, I
think there was only one compilation warning though.

It compiled and linked everything, kept spitting out errors in the
postinstall part and then I saw, understandably, alot of waiting for
unfinished jobs messages. This is where my boneheaded script kept looping
through the making library part.

I got the above mentioned error on the:

        @echo '## Creating links so old library names still work...'

line.

I figured I got through every dependency but the libraries one, so I copied
the remaining commands (the rm -f ... ln -s ... ; \ lines) after this line
in this dependancy to /usr/local/lib/tf... and ran it.

Figuring I was done, it was time to try running tf.

After realizing that tf-40a4 didn't have an .exe prefix for some reason. I
did:

mv tf-40a4 tf-40a4.exe
rm tf.exe
ln -s tf-40a4.exe tf.exe

doing an unset TFLIBDIR so that it would load the library files from the
new directory I finally ran it and to my immediate joy saw the familiar
errors and warnings from my various .tf concoctions -)

Now it connected to my world just fine and ran. Visual mode didn't quite
work but I would expect that from the terminal setting I used. Also,
whenver I tried to start it as tf -n then /world to something I would get:

main_loop: select

and it would exit.

Another problem I noticed, again probably related to my terminal setting is
that when instead of using a command window I try to telnet into my machine
I get no keyboard input while in tf. The only thing that seems to respond
is ctrl+c and that resumes immediately (using the right terminal and keymap
settings of course). I'll try to rebuild it with ncurses and see if that
helps...

My gut feeling tells me the make errors come from b19 using bash2... But I
could be wrong. If anyone has compiled tf with bash2.something as /bin/sh
lemme know.

That's all, sorry for rambling.

A few corrections:

The make error is now documented on the cygwin32 list as only occuring in
win95, hence this had nothing to do with the shell. The shell b19 puts in
/bin/sh is actually Ash be default, but you have to change it to bash for
some compilations. In either case this shouldn't affect tf in any way. On
nt tf should compile without a snag, though I haven't tested this.

later,
Raf

Two questions: 

(1) Is there a program that allows people to read the TF help files outside
of running TF itself. I assume there must be, if the files are written in
the first place!

(2) If 'yes', is there a version that can be run under Win95 in some way?

I would appreciate information about such a program, should it exist!

TF was (at least partially) written in a Unix environment. That means
that help files, configuration files and source code are human-readable
(i.e. not binary, just ASCII). 

The format is so simple you should be able to see it by just looking at
the help files. I think finding them is the harder task (look for
"tf-help").

So any program able to read text files can read e.g. the help files.

> (2) If 'yes', is there a version that can be run under Win95 in some way?

Hmmm ... any word processor, write, notebook, edit or edlin under DOS,
etc.


Sorry for the advocacy ...

I have gotten to build cleanly again and applied my patches that are present
in the ~hawkmoon derived Win32 binary.  I will be updating the installer
this week, and hopefully, we will have a better platform for running this.
The following issues appear to be resolved or improved.

/sh now behaves more like a true UNIX Shell, though it can spawn Windows
Applications
/quote ! remains broken.

Jumpy scrolling appears to be improved though not yet perfect.

General performance is marginally improved.

Dropped connections have been reduced to a minimum

Reminder: I am trying to read these UNIX-based files under Windows95, so,
advice will have to vary based on that (I do realize there may not be a way
to read it).

>The format is so simple you should be able to see it by just looking at
>the help files. I think finding them is the harder task (look for
>"tf-help").

You would think that, except, the help file (I have found it, it's hidden
in the lib directory on my version) has 'weird' characters in it. I *guess*
these are the color codes that make the various parts of the help files
stand out when read in TF.

Shown below is a sample of what a section of '/addworld' help looks like:

&/addworld

/addworld

  Usage: 

  [1m/ADDWORLD[22m [-p] [-T<[4mtype[24m>] <[4mname[24m>
[<[4mchar[24m> <[4mpass[24m>] <[4mhost[24m> <[4mport[24m>
[<[4mfile[24m>]
  [1m/ADDWORLD[22m [-T<[4mtype[24m>] default <[4mchar[24m>
<[4mpass[24m> [<[4mfile[24m>]
  [1m/ADDWORLD[22m [-T<[4mtype[24m>] <[4mname[24m>
  ____________________________________________________________________________

  Adds a new world with the name <[4mname[24m>, or defines the default
character and 
  password.  Any omitted fields will assume the values of the corresponding 
  fields of world "default", if there is one.  The third form,
"[1m/addworld[22m 
  -T<[4mtype[24m> <[4mname[24m>", can be used to change the type of an
existing world.  

  If -p is given, [1m%{proxy_host}[22m will be ignored, and all
connections to the 
  world will be direct.

As said, the files are in a special format but quite human readable. Kinda
like 'man' pages on unix.

BUT! (request to Ken Keys)

"tf-40a2.tar.gz" included tf-40a1 help files in HTML-format. I believe Ken
has written some kind of a converter to them. I would be very very very
grateful if Ken Keys could put the tf-40a4 (or the upcoming tf-40a5)
documentation in HTML format downloadable from somewhere. I browse the 40a1
documentation with my lynx very often during mudding and I often run into
things that have changed since.

TIA,

Sorry to spam like this but found something crucial out.
http://tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/help/ seems to contain the up to date version
of the help files in HTML format. I would still like to get them in a nice
downloadable package but this has already been a great help.

Your only option in this case is to turn off %pedantic, which defeats the
whole purpose of having it on (to detect code weirdness).

I'd recommend /setting the variable first, before the /test, or
/set var=$[expression here] would work as well.

(Note: try to use /let instead of /set whenever possible. It will make things
much cleaner.)

Thanks, but not quite what I'm looking for...
I have it semi working now but its a hack which I dislike..
What I'm currently doing is running netcat like this,
nc -l -p 12345 < fifo > fifo
Then connecting to localhost 12345 from tf, then my local editor (emacs)
writes a line to the fifo with a command, which I have a trigger setup for..
etc..

I'd like to pull netcat out of the loop somehow..
TIA

I'm having real trouble with a macro here. I'm sure I'm missing a basic
concept of programming in tf.

The basic problem:

I want to undefine a trigger after it's been triggered n times, where n is
supplied to the initiating macro.


My attempt:

/def starter=/set the_count= %{2} %; \
   /if ({2} > 0) \
      /def -t"Trigger text*" the_trigger = \
         /set the_count == the_count - 1 \%; \
         /if (the_count == 0) \
            /undef the_trigger \%; \
            /undef the_count \%; \
         /else \
            /send %{the_command} \%; \
         /endif %; \
      /send %{the_command} %; \
   /endif

Any help gratefully received !

Thanks

roger

this is common enough that there's a switch for it... all you need to do is
/def -n<number> ....
where <number> is the number of times you want it to go off before
undefining itself.

I am very tired and I believe I can make the script myself but I am just
looking for an easier alternative.

The problem I have is that there are times when my character in the mud is
not responding to commands. For example, when I am unconscious or camping.
What I would like to do is to make a trigger for a text (for example "You
fall unconscious.") that would start collecting the lines to be sent to mud
in a buffer and they would be sent when another trigger goes off (for
example "You die."). I have a lot of triggers on prots and stuff and my
friends depend on me properly reporting protection fall offs etc. But
currently, when I am unconscious and the prot falls off, the command to be
executed ('party say -> PfE <- off!') just gives the line ('You are
unconscious and unable to do anything.') and I have to tell my partymembers
specifically that PfE is off.

So, I can make a hook on SEND and write the lines into a queue and then
send them afterwards, but some of my scripts use /send and thus does not
get caught in the hook.

I don't believe tf supports opening files as worlds (sockets) in any way.
Ofcourse you can open the fifo with tfopen and use it with tfread and
tfwrite, but I don't think that is what you require.

Your netcat solution is as good as any since I don't think that that will
be implemented anytime soon.

I believe your fifo should be called a priority_queue (as it is in STL,
C++). The problem Zephaniah is having has to do with system level fifos,
eg. fifo files. (Usually created on unix etc. systems with 'mknod filename
p') IMHO, fifos are very hard to get to work decently and have numerous
bugs. I prefer using local sockets since they are much more stable and
usable. I have crashed linux 2.0.30 multiprocessor kernel with opening and
closing a lot of fifos.

If this is the essense of what you need, it can be done with tf's ability
to overload builtin commands, where the actualy builtin can be called with
/@send. So define your own send:

/def send = \
  /if (regmatch(*,'some patterns')) \
    * use the /queue commands here to make your command queue,
    * they can be found via /require stack-q.tf
  /endif%;\
  /@send %{*}

Hope that is what you meant...

I fear the /queue will not help much as it only stores single words.

You could perhaps try my old array.tf code, using

; In case you fall unconcious, store all sent stuff in the
; array queue:
/def -mglob -t"You fall unconcious." t_unconcious = \
    /def -h"SEND *" h_sendAll = \
        /append_array queue %{*}
; execute all stored commands:
/def -mglob -t"You die." t_died = \
    /exe_array queue %;\
    /clear_array queue

Perhaps you will have to delay the execution of the array a bit as sending
too many commands to a mu* in short time could make it close the connection.

array.tf can be found at http://www.ph-cip.uni-koeln.de/~dittmar/tf .

I hope it helps; in case you have problems with the code, feel free to ask.

Yup this is the sort of thing I'm after.

The crux of my problem was /set var {2} always treating the resulting var
as text. I even tried 

/set var {2} + 0

But that was still text. I solved the problem (before the /def -n tips came
rolling in - thanks for them) by doing this ...

/set var= $[{2} = 0]

Does this seem right (in terms of integers vs text)?

And can I do this

/def starter = /def -n{2} -t"blah" trigg= blah %; send initiator

?

Hm, why add 0? Inside of a macro just type /set var %{2} or /set var=%{2}

I have a hook on my MAIL event that runs 2 macros...
 /def -p1 -mglob -h'MAIL ' = /mailsubj %; /mailmesgcount %;
 /def mailmesgcount = /quote -decho % !frm -q -S
 /def mailsubj = /quote -decho % From: !frm | tail -1

Trouble is, the output from this appears in reverse order.
Naturally, I tried swapping the order in which /mailsubj
and /mailmesgcount were called and that didn't work either.

Any ideas how to get them to appear in the right order and
why it's going nuts?

Thanks in advance-

Try using /repeat -0 1 for both commands, which suspends execution of the
shell command for 0 seconds (letting all the TF stuff get processed _before_
shelling out and doing the external stuff).

My mail hook, which does similar shell stuff:

/def -i -Fp1 -abh -mglob -h'MAIL ' -q hook_mail = \
 /if (idle() < 600) 
   /repeat -0 1 /quote -S -decho !nfrm %;\
 /endif

I delay the nfrm, so that the "You have new mail in <spooler>" message gets
displayed before the shell output, not after.

Any suggestions on how I could get emacs using a localsocket?
The fifo setup I have now is a little bit of a hack on both ends but much

Do you think you could make a exploit script so we could get it patched?

Ok this looks much much better. What you said previously:

---<snip>---

is different from your real example. In your real example, the green color
from the end of the previous line bleeded to the beginning of the next
line. In what you said before, the color of the "status" bleeded, which was
after the text in question and such impossible.

If the "^[[0m" part of the end of the previous line ("^[[1;32mT^[[0m--]")
is left out then the the green color ("^[[1;32m") will bleed from that
point on to the next line until a different color is set.

Now on to the real problem:

Why is that "^[[0m" part disappearing from that line occasionally. I don't
know if the mud you play is a lpmud or do you have %lp set, but if the line
comes out choppy because of heavy lag or lot of text from the mud, I have
seen starts and ends of colour codes lost in prompting. This ofcourse
doesn't happen if your client does not differentiate between prompts and
regular text, such as CRT or plain telnet. I really can't tell you how to
handle this because I haven't (yet) read the source code how prompting is
really done in tf. Try fiddling with the %lp and maybe do some hooks for
PROMPT that doesn't do anything and a special hook, PROMPT ^[[36;1m>^[[0m
^[[36m, for your prompts.

Also, I would like to know if there's any way of completely turning of
prompting in tf? My mud sends telnet-goaheads (i think) but I wan't even
them not to get interpreted. Eg. no line gets processed until a newline is
received. I think I can hack it in to the source, if not, but I would wish
for it to be implemented.

Or undocumented features. For example, when the other end of the fifo is
closed, the other end is too, without notification. Also, I haven't been
able to use 'select' reliably on those (it blocks occasionally). Sure, if
you just want to connect two programs outputs, it's fine. But if you'd like
to make a base station, which handles 10-20 different programs via fifos
and transmits data between all of them, I ran into difficulties I couldn't
overcome.

Either the tf or the emacs must ofcourse listen for connections in a
particular port. Emacs could easily with a lot of elisp coding, tf not so
easily (as noted with using tf as an irc client, for DCC transfers you must
be able to start listening a particular socket). You can ofcourse use
libnet and put perl in between which is a wonderful solution ;) Me? I'd
write the info in a file and then 'kill tfPID SIGUSR1' and /hook SIGUSR1 ;)

I heard since that 2.0.30 had some deadlocks in multiprocessor things. Use
2.0.32, it works :)

Hrm, from what I'm seeing the connection is acting more like a localecho
port when the other side is not open.. (=:]

Currently I'm just using it as a 1 way pipe from emacs to tf..

I don't know a bit of elisp, my odd ability to hack things together from
semi to totaly unrelated things let me get emacs writing the name of the
current buffer to the fifo, even got a newline after it (=:]

Not knowing a bit of perl makes this a non issue (=:]

Hrm, was not aware you could hook signals, that was actualy one of my
first ideas but I dismissed it because I did not want to hackup tf when I
could do it another way, now, any suggestions on how to run a program from
emacs? (I can write shell scripts and C much better then I could hack
elisp)

Ahh, I'm on 2.0.33, plan on going back to the 2.1's soon..

Yeah, study those docs carefully. Those signals are very handy.

If you want to run a program from emacs, you can use
(shell-command COMMAND BUFFER-NAME)
BUFFER-NAME can be left out or nil, in which case a new output buffer is
created (*Shell Command Output*). Or it can be a buffer name, in which case
the output is inserted after point in that buffer. Or it can be non-nil and
not a buffer name (for example 't') in which case the output is inserted
after point in current buffer.

If you don't need the output and just want to efficiently run (exec?) a
program, I haven't got the faintest idea... try C-h i g shell or the lisp
side. Ofcourse, an emacs newsgroup is a better place for this stuff.

/quote normally doesn't actually execute a shell command, just schedules
it.  %ptime seconds later, the command is executed.  Your two processes
run in parallel, and the first is probably slower than the second, which
is why its output comes last.  To make the shell command execute
synchronously (that is, execute NOW, instead of just being scheduled),
use /quote -S.  Also, you can just combine the two commands into one
/quote:

   /def -h'MAIL' mail_hook = \
       /quote -decho % !echo From: `frm | tail -1`; frm -q -S

Thought I post this bug incase someone can fix it.

(C:\PROGRA~1\tf\tf.exe 1000) In cygwin_except_handler

This has happened several times when this happens the program locks
up I have to close the dead program out and start TF again.

Maybe someone can figure out how running edit under dos shell in NT
then runing tinyfugue after enables blinking ansi.  If one of the two
programmers
that have been porting TF to NT can figure out whats really going on
underthe hood they can implement it into TF. Now the blicking ansi will
go
away as soon as you switch from full screen to a window and back again,
then
you have to /quit run edit again the run TF. I mean what is really going
on
is NT that messed up that you can do weird stuff like this :) ?

Someone mentioned once to have a installation archive available that had a
precompiled version of win32 TF with an installation script.  Anyone know
where it may be found?  I'm trying to set someone up with TF, but they're
unfortunately a thousand miles away and walking them through the GDK hasn't
worked out.  Thanks in advance.

Hello,

I'm using TinyFugue version 4.0 alpha 4. and get this warning when one of my
macros gets executed:

% idleanswer: warning: %... substitution in expression can be confusing.  Try 
using {...} instead.

The macro looks like:

/def -mregexp -p1 -t'^(.*) tells you: ' idleanswer = \
        /set idlewho=$[tolower(%{P1})]%; \
        /if (idlestatus) \
                /eval /send tell $[idlewho] I'm idle at the moment.%; \
        /endif

I don't understand what that warning complains about. What's wrong with the
macro? It seems to work quite well and I have no idea what I should change.

Thanks for your help.

Harry

You don't need %'s when you're inside an expression (the $[..] part)
So you'd use /set idlewho=$[tolower({P1})]
, and instead of using $[idlewho] for a variable, try using %{idlewho}
instead.

Oh, and one more thing, don't use ^(.*) at the beginning of a regexp, it's
not needed and wastes cpu time. Use %{PL} instead. And don't use /eval
either if you can help it. And use -w in /send in case you change worlds.
And clean up your room and look both ways before crossing the street.

anyway, try this:

/def -mregexp -p1 -t' tells you: ' idleanswer = \
        /set idlewho=$[tolower({PL})]%; \
        /if (idlestatus) \
                /send -w tell %{idlewho} I'm idle at the moment.%; \
        /endif

The $[] is an expression, this $[tolower({P1})] is sufficient :)

$[tolower(P1)] would be sufficient, too, but I generally use {}'s for
clearer coding.

Mad.

Replace the %{P1} inside of the $[...] by {P1} and all is fine.

The reason for the warning has to do with the question which substitution
takes part first (substitution of the %{P1} from the macro evaluation of
idelanswer or the substitution of the %{P1} as part of the $[...]).
What exactly is done step by step here I can't tell, I just know which 
version works ...                                     *grin*

Just like Harry, I have a similar problem with substitutions: 

% /usr/local/lib/tf-lib/grouping.tf, line 26: eval: warning: %...
substitution in expression can be confusing.  Try using {...} instead.

How the line numbering works, I fail to understand, but the only place
where I have a substitution of that sort is line 17, which looks like this

/def -ip$[%{maxpri}-2] -mregexp \
    -h'send ^([a-zA-Z0-9/ -]+;)+(|([a-zA-Z0-9/ -]+))$$$' \
    ~grouping = /~do_grouping %%%*%%;\

Now, removing the % before {maxpri} only results in a new error message,
namely

% /home/shanta/.tfrc, line 57: grouping: warning: %... substitution in 
expression can be confusing.  Try using {...} instead.

where I do the following 

/grouping on

Thanks, 
  Henrik.

Looks like you've got more of the same problem farther down the same file,
then.

You've got the same %{} substitution problem all through this file.
Whenever you have an expression context (inside a $[], or the body of a 
/test, or inside a /if ()), remove all % in front of variable names.
 
Why do you have this /eval at the beginning of the file?  It is not
necessary, and is only going to trip you up.
(There have been many other warnings about /eval recently on this list,
and they should all be heeded.)

With the removal of /eval, all the %% can be collapsed to %.  And there
shouldn't be any % inside expressions (see above) at all.

A simple trigger, to prepare the line and write to a file:

/set tell_file=<filename to log to>

/def -Fq -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ tells you \'(.*[^\'])\'$' log_tells=\
  /test fwrite(tell_file, strcat({1}, " ", {P1}))

It's not really meant for public consumption but the one Fade wrote
and I hacked to pieces and re-wrote is available at
   http://www.tertius.net.au/~gossamer/geek/tf/irc

Feel free to email me if it doesn't make sense.

I had seen this mentioned here before, so just tired out the copy you 
mentioned.

I connect, but this is my entire session (on every server I've tried):

--------
NOTICE AUTH :Looking up your hostname...
NOTICE AUTH :Found your hostname, cached
NOTICE AUTH :Checking Ident
NOTICE AUTH :No Ident response
ERROR :Closing Link: 165.95.11.7 (Ping timeout)

I used:

/addworld -T"irc" irc irc.phoenix.net 6661

Any clues?

That's not the IRC scripts fault, it just means you don't have an
ident server running.  Set one up!

Actually, this is something I do need to do.  Strangely enough, a couple 
of the servers claimed they got an identd response *???*

Okay, I got an identd server up, and connected.  The server did get the 
ident response.  But now, it gives "Register first." responses to all 
commands (including the ping->pong trigger), and closes with a ping 
timeout.

Okay, i got the script up and running (nice job!) and I'm getting the 
following problem.

This *ONLY* happens on this channel.  I don't know why, but here's full info.

TF v4.0 a4 under OS/2 Warp Connect

Session log:

---------------
[DEBUG] :Vrallis!~bhartin@ma909a.tamucc.edu JOIN :#os/2

At this point TF dies instantly--no error message from TF at all.

The following is from OS/2:

Again, for whatever strange reason, it only seems to hate the output from 
this channel.

Anyone want to tackle this?  Or request more info?

Just a wild guess, but would it have anything to do with the / in
the channel name?  Try creating a channel with a / in the name and
see if your client still barfs on the 'join' messages.. that will
at least identify the source of the problem.

I'm not very familiar with tf programming, but I've got one problem with
which I've seen to ran to a dead end...
The trigger is something like this..

/def -F -t'*tells you \"{*}\"' = say %4

but it just don't word... And If I make it like this...

/def -F -t'*tells you {*}' = say %4

It works just fine, but there are quotes in the result, which I want to
get rid of.. What or rather how should I do this ?

{*} (in glob) only picks up complete words - that is, groups of characters
split by spaces.  With the " before and after the braces, the part that you
are hoping to match the * is no longer a complete word.. therefore \"{*}\"
cannot ever match anything.

I believe I posted the correct solution yesterday, but here it is again
(using regular expressions):

/def -F -mregexp -t'tells you \"(.*[^\"])\"$' name_of_macro = say %P1

some suggestions: read help matching, set matching to whatever you want the
default to be (if you aren't going to specify it in defs), and always name
your macros.

Try this:

/def -F -mregexp -t"[A-z]+ tells you '(.+)'$" t_tell_to_say = say %{P1}

Hello!

Actually I wanted to ask the question from owner of the list, but
owner-tinifugue@tcp.com didn't work.

So, is it possible to add some kind of automatic prefix to subject line      
by list server? It makes more convenient to determine weather is the mail
from list or is it private and then, delete the mail without looking in   
it, if topic on subject line doesn't interest me.

Tecnically it should be possible with majordomo (the software that runs
tinifugue mailinglist).

Well, this regexp is a bit funny. Firstly, this doesn't match 'tells you
""' line at all. This is no big problem. But I can't understand why should
we use (.*[^\"]) instead of ([^\"]*). Unless ofcourse the string has many
'"' marks in it. In which case your regexp matches 'tells you "wonder"boy"
hood"' but not 'tells you "wonder"boy""'. And again, unless this is the
point, I can't see why we shouldn't use (.*). This works even if the
string is not anchored at the end, because expression matching is greedy
by default. So, I would use,

-t'tells you \"([^\"]*)\"$'

if I want it NOT to match multiple quotes in the tell, or,

-t'tells you \"(.*)\"$'

if I want them to be matched or don't care.

There is no noticable speed difference between these two versions.

Why not just filter on one of the headers in the message?  There are a
number of them that are quite distinctive.

Problem is that I want to see the messages in the INBOX (so called in
pine). To filter them to somewhere another folder means that I have to
open another folder to see what is there, etc. I just want to walk through
INBOX quickly and see if there is something interesting in mailinglists
too. Something like [TINYFUGUE] on subject line or something would be very
helpfull in determining where it is from. While I know that there must be
only a line

	subject_prefix = [TINIFUGUE]

in majordomo's mailinglist config file, I hope I don't have to write a
program/filter that preppends a prefix to all mails came from mailinglist
and that's why I tried to give a suggestion at first to owner-tinyfugue.

Hello,

First I want to thank you for your fast help with my last problem. It's working
fine now. :-) While writing more and more nice macros and stuff I came across
another problem.

I want to have several triggers which all look similar.

It is like:

You punch ...
You hit ...
You miss ...
You slash ...

and so on.

Now I wonder wether it's better to install the triggers like

Pseudocode:

if line starts with "You punch "
    blah
endif
if line starts with "You hit "
    blah
endif
...

or if it's better to do

if line starts with "You " then
  if line starts with "You punch "
    blah
  endif
  if line starts with "You hit "
    blah
  endif
  ...
endif

The action (blah) which should be performed will be the same for all triggers.

Thanks for your thoughts.

Harry

Some of us would find it very annoying. As has been pointed out there are
a number of headers that indicate where they are coming from. I understand
why you want it like that but there are better solutions if thats the way
you utilize the list. I'm not sure if there is a digested version of this
list or not but that would be much more appropriate for the kind of
purusing you want to do. Alternatively install something like procmail or
some other filtering program and have mail from the list shunted to a
special folder.

A filtering package would be handy for a lot of other uses as well and
would be a good tool to have at your disposal.

Of course the subject line addition would be much less annoying then the
huge footer the list sticks on every message;)

Its not a topic of tf, but... I'd like to argue still :).

I don't think so, because typical text-terminal mail program displays only
a sender person name (or address if name not available) and a subject
line. Much more annoying and timeconsuming is to enter the mail under the
subject itself and determine some useful headers than notice a short
prefix [TF] at the beginning of subject line, or, alternatively, open
another folder. If I have several mailing lists coming in my mailbox, I
want to quickly walk through received mails listing and if I don't have
currently (but _not_ permanently) time to read any mail from tf mailing
list or subject isn't interesting, I can delete them quickly, if I see
[TF] (or any other prefix from some other mailinglist) on subject line,
without opening the mail text itself to see headers, or without collecting
these mails uselessly to somewhere using filters. Is the [TF] at the 
beginning of subject line really so annoying? Most mailinglists I have
seen prepend the prefix to subject line.

I have procmail and i know how to do this, but the solution I'm trying to
explain looks better for me (I know I'm an egoist :)) (both, intuitively
and human-computer-interaction-psychological-theoretically).

Well, i think it would be no problem to set a 'subject_prefix = [TF]' in
the tinyfugue.config file. I get the tf mails into my working mailfolder, 
so i would be happy, if ken sets an identification in the subject, because
it takes some time to sort out the tf mails from my commercial mails :-)

Well, a few points to raise.

A) This isn't really all that appropriate for the list, unless the charter
allows for "meta" discussions. Better by far to simply take it to the list
owner (since, if you can't get a response out of him, nothing will change
no matter WHAT you say).

B) It's not a democracy. Make your points to the admin, and if he agrees,
it'll get done. If not, you'll be SOL. But it's not a matter of popular
vote.

C) You could probly use procmail to rewrite the subject line to your taste,
on a local basis, IIRC. No, I don't have a recipie for it offhand, but I'm
fairly sure it would be possible.

D) Thanks for listening, but I really doubt anyone should be following up
to this message in public. If you want to take issue with what I've said,
do it on my time and yours, not everybody's.

I wanted to agree with this suggestion (in case Ken is tracking 'yea' and
'nay' responses). I already add the subject suffix '[TF]' to all my TF help
requests because, while I can filter mailing list messages automatically, I
*cannot* filter personal responses back automatically (I would have to know
who is going to respond ahead of time to set up the filter). By setting
'[TF]' in the subject, as long as someone 'Replies-to' my mail, my filters
will catch it.

If the list began to automatically added the header, it would make my
filtering just a little bit easier (I wouldn't have to remember to type
it). But, there may be other reasons why the prefix shouldn't be set. So,
back to the regularly scheduled discussion...

The last one, of course. This can all be caught using a single trigger.

I think in pine, it automatically puts a + for mails that are private to
you? So there shouldn't be a problem.

Ok, here is a simple way to do this with procmail:
	:0 fw
	* ^TOtinyfugue@
	| /usr/bin/sed 's/^Subject: /&[TF] /'

Yes. But that's just my personal opion - you are entitled to have your
own ;-)

Most mailinglist I have seen don't. (And yes, I've seen quite a few ;)


Johan

P.S. Ofcourse the procmail rule isn't perfect: if there'd be other
lines in the message starting with Subject: as well, they'd get an
extra [TF] as well... But then again, how often does that happen?

I'm also in favor of it.  I can filter it fine now, but I've got other lists
which add a prefix, and I find it a nice feature.  And a prefix as short as
[TF] is about as unobtrusive as you can get.

This is off topic, but it seems like a concern of several folks,
so what the heck.

Pine allows you have multiple "inboxes" which it will check 
automatically for new mail by pressing the <TAB> key.  You
can also set it to automatically put read mail into a different
folder--and you can set a "read" folder for *each* inbox.

So far I have 16 inboxes.  If I get added to a new list, I will
add another inbox.  Some of these have >1000 mails, and it's 
still fast.

.pinerc options to look at:
# List of incoming msg folders besides INBOX, e.g. ={host2}inbox, {host3}inbox
# Syntax: optnl-label {optnl-imap-host-name}folder-path
incoming-folders="mbox" /users/nmiller/mail/mbox,
        "wakeup" ~/mail/wakeup,
        "admin" ~/mail/admin,
[etc]

# List of folder pairs; the first indicates a folder to archive, and the
# second indicates the folder read messages in the first should
# be moved to.
incoming-archive-folders=mbox mbox.read,
			 wakeup, wakeup.read

Turn on the feature "auto-move-read-messages" if you want the
moves to happen automatically.

Pine's help is very extensive, there are a lot of features to it.

Not necessarily faster. The issue is not so simple.

We have 3 simple options on how to do this

First:
/def -t"You punch *" = blah
/def -t"You hit *"   = blah
/def -t"You miss *"  = blah
/def -t"You slash *" = blah

This is fairly fast, because 4 different glob matches hardly slow the
client down.

Second:
/def -t"You *" = (lots of ifs etc.)

This is probably not as fast, as we still have to match the You
punch/hit/miss/slash lines from the previous ones and we end up with 5
comparisons instead of 4. Ofcourse we can look directly at the second word
of the matched part, but I doubt if it still gets faster than the first one.

Third:
/def -mregexp -t"^You (punch|hit|miss|slash) " = blah

This uses a regexp match instead of glob matches, but is fairly fast still
because the regexp engine is very efficient and it will discard lines that
do not start with "You " very fast. The lines that start with "You " will
not be so fast, since we have 4 paths to choose and we have to put the
variable (P1) to the verb (punch/hit/miss/slash) in the parenthesis. Of
course, if this were to be perl (hey Ken!;), we would use "^You
(?:punch|hit|miss|slash) " to avoid the unnecessary variable clogging. But
still, I believe this is the fastest of them all, unless tf's glob matching
is hyper-optimized. Also, as I said, IMHO, whatever, the second way is the
worst way to do it because it requires additional matching and the speed
gain achieved by preliminary narrowing of the matches is very slim.

TF can be started with a worldname to make it connect to that
world immediately, but is there a way to get it to run a
certain macro on startup?

I'd prefer to be able to do it by syecifying something on the
command line ... I know I -could- write a wrapper script to
manipulate .tfrc to do this, but it seems messier.

You could have code in .tfrc check for the value of an environment
variable, and if it has a value, to execute its contents.

Then, all you have to do is just set the environment variable before you
start TF (bash will let you do this on the command line; otherwise you
could do it easily with a shell alias).

Hi all,

I have the following problem, from various of my triggers and aliases I
need to check a certain spell to determine if a special action needs to be
used in casting that spell. So if the spell is called "sanc" it will
perform the actions for casting a cleric spell, if it is called "sandstorm"
it will perform the action of casting a mage spell. Problem is there are
ALOT of spells I need to consider, and I want "sanc" and "sanctuary" to be
treated the same, and if it is just "san" not to treat it as ambiguos (sanc
or sandstorm etc) but give preference to the cleric spells. I could use a
giant regmatch() with lots of |s, and then some ifs after, but I was
wondering if that was the most efficient way, or if I should implement
something like a binary search tree, and if so how I would go about doing
it...not sure if I'm making any sense.

Raf

Hang on, if you HAVE procmail then just set it up
to ADD these prefixes for you.

And then, if I reply to some of messages from tinyfugue@tcp.com, the
subject lines will contail the string [TF] (because my procmail adds it)
and a lot of people will get annoyed...

Phew, I think I got it. So you have a lot of cleric spells
("sanc","whatever") and a lot of mage spells ("sandstorm","thingy") and you
want to use some kind of a construct to do /cast sandstorm and /cast sanc
so that it casts them appropriately. And you want to be able to just type
/cast san and have it pick the first cleric spell starting with san or if
there isn't one, the first mage spell starting with san. [ If you meant
just that we should pick alphabetically the next spell name after "san",
which is "sanc" not "sandstorm", ignore the talk later about 2 separate
lists. ]


There's a lot of solutions for this, some harder than others.

First of all, you could use some kind of variable stuff (/set
spell_sanc=cleric%;/set spell_sandstorm=mage, etc), but I think that isn't
the best solution.

Secondly, what I would use, is make real macros for every spell, eg.
   /def spell_sanc = /cast_cleric sanc
   /def spell_sandstorm = /cast_mage sandstorm
In which case you can put invidual casting procedures here, too, if you
happen to have some spells which require additional operations or have
special effects. Then I would do the /cast command to do something like
/eval /spell_%1 to do the casts (ofcourse handling multiple parameters).
But now we have the problem of how to handle /cast san. If we were to treat
cleric and mage spells the same, we could just do a /list spell_* and stuff
the command names in to a variable and then use the functions available in
complete.tf to do our stuff for us. If we really really need the cleric
spell preference, we could put 2 separate lists and first try to complete
from the first one and if that fails, complete from the second one.

I think the second option gives a lot of flexibility, because not all
spells have to be casted exactly like a cleric spell or a mage spell and if
a spell needs some ingredients or some ceremony to prepare for them, we can
implement those easily.

I hope I got it right and hopefully I will help somebody else to understand
it too and make a better solution, since there probably is one.

Hey folks.  Is there a way that I could /more on for one world, but
not for another?  I know there's no way to do that with /more, but in
functionality, that's what I want.

I have one world that I consider my primary world.  In this one, I
like having /more on, so I don't miss anything.  Another world is a
secondary world.  I generally don't care what happens there, but when
I switch to it, I'd rather not have to ESC-J all the scroll that's
accumulated there.  But I'd still like to be able to check it's
history with /recall if I need to.  Am I asking too much? :)

I think soo...

Try this:

/def -Fq -h'WORLD (.+)' h_worlds = \
  /if (${world_name} =~ 'world where you don't want more') \
    /more off%;\
  /else \
    /more on%;\
  /endif

or the other way around. I haven't tried this, but it should work :)

	Using tinyfugue to code is cool, but I wonder if there's a way to 
get TF to count all the brackets () {} [] that is in what I'm typing at 
the moment.

	Ya think?

I am using tf 4.0a4, and I'm having some trouble with the /recall command.
Is anyone else having trouble making it work? 

This is what I'm trying to do, although I'll settle for ANYTHING. I'm a
little frustrated. ;)

The mud sends me:
You receive 94 experience points.

I want to be able to find all the lines containing that string that the
mud has send me. I keep getting the error message "extra characters after
recall range", so perhaps I'm not reading the helpfile right. Everything
I've tried has failed.
 
Any suggestions, or comments? I appreciate any help you can give me.

Chris

Try "/recall -mregexp 1000 You receive [0-9]+ experience points.".

Many thanks to all who responded, it works. I don't entirely understand
it, but that's OK ;)

For those wondering, I'm now using /recall -mglob #1000 *pattern*
I assume from reading the helpfile that the #1000 means to look into the
last 1000 lines, and show line numbers.

Thanks again!

Chris

/recall -mregexp /1000 ^You receive [0-9]+ experience points\.$

The /1000 means the last 1000, the ^ and $ characters prevent quoted lines
from comm channels and such.

Uhm. That should be 1000, not #1000. It sees #1000 as text, since it's not
a number, which causes your error.

Mad.

No, # means show line numbers.

/recall #/10 gossip

That would show the last 10 gossip lines, with lines numbers, using your
default matching method.

The helpfile is right. You just gotta understand it :)

/recall 1- You receive {*} experience points.

that 1- means from line 1 to the end eg. all.

Hope you can figure the rest by yourself now.

If this is on a diku mud you will get a hell of alot of battle spam, nad
quite few of those lines in the history buffer. So this is not a good
solution. But it should still work, put this in your .tfrc:

/def recallexp = /recall -mregexp %{histsize} '^You receive [0-9]+
experience points[.]$'

then typing /recallexp any time in your session will recall the lines you
want. (default histsize is 1000 lines btw.)

A better solution, one I am using, is to set a global variable called
"exp-cost" in a world hook for a particular world to contain the amount of
exp you need for your next level. Then make a trigger that looks something
like this:

/def -T"diku" -F -mregexp -t'^You have scored ([0-9]+) exp[.]$' t_exp_calc = \
  /repeat -w -0 1 \
    /echo You need a total of %{exp-cost} exp for this level.%%;\
    /echo You require $[{exp-cost}-{P1}] exp to level.

Hope that helps,
Raf

Ok. I've been using TF for a while now, never really bothered to write any
 of my own macros etc.  However, I have to do something.  First off,
here's the situation.  I need to @decompile an entire pennmush db, and put
it back up on another pennmush site. Assume I have god status on both.
Anyone happen to have something written that would accomplish this
already?

Okay, with a little minor playing with, this sorta worked.  It /does/
turn more off when I switch to that world.  Unfortunately it doesn't
do anything about the lines waiting to scroll when I change to that
world.  I tried adding a /dokey FLUSH before the /more off, but that
didn't seem to do anything.  Anyone know of a way to flush a
background world?

I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but probably more useful is the ESC -
keybinding, which moves the cursor from a parenthesis/bracket to its
match.

	What I mean, is as your typing out some code, you get something 
like... 

	Pemit(%#,Ansi(r,StrCat(XGet(%#,Thing),|,XGet(%#,OtherThing)))

... the cursor being right behind the last bracket.  You and I can tell 
that there is one bracket missing, but with a code that's longer, say 
with a total of a hundred brackets, it would be MUCH harder to see.  What 
I need help with, is a way, a keybinding, that when activated would count 
all the brackets and outpout their total.

	Mind you, a keybinding that would go to a bracket's match, like 
you suggested, Ken, would be fascinating as well.

Ken wasn't making a suggestion.. there really is a binding in stdlib.tf
that matches brackets/braces/parentheses.  esc hyphen, when the cursor is
positioned over a bracket.

/fg -q will switch to a world without showing you all the lines that were
waiting.

(Also you don't need the .+ in the hook above.. that just slows things down.)
So, you could rewrite the bindings esc-f, esc-b, and esc-w so that when
switching to some worlds, you do a /fg -q instead of just /fg.

It's already part of tf. :) Place the cursor on a bracket, hit <ESC>- and
the cursor will jump to the matching bracket.

Heya.

I'm slightly confused about this one little thing. How do I make sure
that any /echo's and /send's in a trigger send their stuff to the world
where that trigger was activated? From what I've read, -w sends to the
current world but I am unsure as to wether or not that means the world
in the foreground or the world that triggered the trigger. These two
may not necessarily be one and thesame.

PS. The trigger is restricted by world type rather then world name.
(ie. -T was used rather then -w when the trigger was defined)

I'm writing a macro variation on the do_follow example in the help
files. The problem I have is that some of the things I follow capitalise
the first letter of their name sometimes.
eg. following squirrel = Brown squirrel leaves east
    following bear     = Bear ascends eastwards

My macro is ...

/def kil = /send kill $[tolower({1})] %; \
   /def -mregexp -p2 -t"%{1} (leaves|ascends|descends) ([a-z]*)\\\\.$$" track =
\
   /if (strstr(\%P2, "wards") >= 0) \
      /let newstr \$[substr(\%P2, 0, strlen(\%P2)-5)] \%; \
      /send \$[\%{newstr}] \%; \
   /else \
      /send \%P2 \%; \
   /endif

And it works if I know the capitalisations of the animals and type

/kil Bear  or  /kil squirrel

What I'd like to do is have the regexp match case insensitive. I hope I've
just overlooked a flag or switch or something. If not I'll have to go back
to glob (which I couldn't get to work at all).

Thanks in advance

cheers

Rog.

Hey folks.  Anyone know of a way to call a macro with a key-binding,
say ESC-L, and have any text entered on the input line be passed to it
appropriately?

The text on the command line can be gotten via  $[strcat(kbhead(),kbtail())].

/help bind or /help def will show you how to make a keybinding macro... try
/def -b'^{[L'. You can get the input line with kbhead() and kbtail() (don't
see one at the moment that gets the whole input buffer)

-w will make sure the /echo or /send is directed to the world where
the trigger was activated. So it should work fine if you use the -w
option.

There is no such thing as case insensitive regular expressions. However
you can just check if it is bear or Bear with something like:

/def kil = /send kill $[tolower({1})] %; \
    /let victim=$[strcat("(", toupper(substr({1}, 0, 1)), "|",
        tolower(substr({1}, 0, 1)), ")", tolower(substr({1}, 1)))]%;\
    /def  -mregexp -p2 -t"%{victim} (leaves|ascends|descends) ([a-z]*)\\\\.$$"
        track = ...

So when the argument is "bear" then victim will become "(B|b)ear"
and the trigger will work as usual. I know it looks a bit nasty,
but it sure will work fine ;-)

From /help sockets:
  The current socket is the socket to which commands are sent.  The current 
  socket is almost always the same as the foreground socket, except: 1) when a 
  trigger is called from any socket, that socket becomes the current socket 
  for the duration of the trigger execution; 2) when a /repeat or /quote with 
  world redirection runs (-w option), that world's socket becomes the current 
  socket for the duration of the process execution.

Sorry about giving an idea. I didn't want that. As I said, If somebody
starts to append the prefixes with his/her own procmail, much more people
get annoyed than prefix-by-majordomo variant. Majordomo elliminates the
problem with

	subject_prefix = [TF]

Then it appears only at once and at the beginning of subject line.
Majordomo deletes all the occurances of [TF] somewhere else on subject
line.

Or /recall -i - -1 which must ofcourse be wrapped in $(/recall -i - -1)

Dunno which one is the "right" way.

I never should have posted that emergency solution with procmail.
However since people actually seem to be using it, I will post an
improved version as well. (Though I still think this discussion shouldnt
even be going on on this list in the first place.)

:0 fwh
* ^TOtinyfugue@
| /usr/bin/sed '/^Subject: /s/\[TF\] //g; s/^Subject: /&[TF] /'

This will remove all existing [TF] tags from the subject before adding
a new one.
The extra 'h' in the first line makes sure that only header fields are
changed by sed. Adding this was a great suggestion from Philip Pennock
(hope I got that name right as I lost his original mail...).

Ciao,
Johan

So, for your convenience I will have to run my mail through yet another
script to remove those fugly [TF] markers from the subject line. No Thank You.

Start using procmail on your emails like everybody else. My friends using PINE
says you can be notified about new mails in several mailboxes, so it's not
like if it's a big problem for you.

Very nice, your signature is bigger than the entire mail text...

Heyas. :)

First off, thanks to all those that helped out with the last question. But
now I have a new one. I have made a matching trigger which requires a massive
/if statement within it. I'd love for a way to not have to have such an icky
thing getting executed whenever there is a match so I thought that, as the if
statement always tests the same argument vs many strings that I could
define a macro with all the possible values for the argument as part of the
name and trigger it somehow BUT I've come across a hassle or more. :)

1. I can't find a way of creating a macro that wont be executed as a command.
2. I find that /trigger is NOT what I want.

Basically what I need is a way to define a macro that isn't a trigger or
a hook nor a command and have a way of getting it to execute.

Say the arg can hold the following vals: a b c d

I then create macros: test_a test_b test_c test_d

These macros contain the code that should be executed depending on the
value of arg.

I'd then call it with something like: /execute test_%{1}=<text to pass>

This would be useful because a. it doesn't clutter up the command table,
b. doesn't slow tf down because it has to be checked whenever output
from a world happens and c. no need to define a hook.

Now, if there IS a way in tf to do what I want easily I'd love to
hear about it. I've travelled through the helpfiles muchly and have
been unable to find anything approaching what I want (I'm a newbie to
this so maybe I'm missing something :).

If there isn't a way, could it be added? Be a nice way to simplify
triggers et all by not having to clutter them up with huge chunks of
code.

Thanks in adance for any and all help. :)

The 'relative merit' of signatures isn't the question here. The problem
that exists with people having extremely long sigs is that it take
disproportionately and annoyingly long to download mail that contains
barely any useful information.

Remember not everyone reads their mail on a machine with a T1 link, etc.

Just my .02 dollars.

Mad.

If you feel unduly bothered by the signatures of various list
submissions, then that is entirely your own affair. The process of 
implementing such an angle is actually rather elementary: one simply
stop reading when one reaches the end of the body of a given e-mail.
Amazing, eh?

Seriously, while you're perfectly entitled to your own view pertaining
to the relative merits of signatures, there is absolutely no need for
the rest of existence--or rather more, the members of the mailing 
list--to adopt your indubitably refined sensibilities.

That is, of course, all IMNSHO, while YMMV--actually, I'm pretty 
certain that it does, at that.

I can not think of any harm in making it a command eg. macro. That is the
way tf library scripts have been built. That is the way it was meant to
be.

Name your macros beginning with a _ . That is what they use in the tf
libraries. Eg. _test_a, _test_b, ... and call them /_test_a. Make them
invisible by using -i in the def. And they don't slow the client down.

Ofcourse we can implement what you are asking but it would be even less
efficient than this.

	Can someone help me actually make this (as I am a TF code newbie)?

The problem is, if you know C/C++/Pascal/assembly for all I care, but no
scripting languages, you still have a problem..

Most people that haven't ever programmed in a scripting language look at
tf files and generally go totally nuts.. Keep that in mind, people :) Not
everyone has a wide variety of programmig languages like us :)

Mad.

The idea is correct, although "[Bb]ear" would be slightly better than
"(B|b)ear".

Another solution is to use a glob (which is case insensitive) for the
trigger, and then use some method other than %Pn to get the word, like
$[substr(L, 0, -1)].

The only way to avoid striping nonprinting characters so you can trigger
on them is to /set emulation=raw, which I strongly recommend against,
since embedded nonprinting characters will mess up other triggers, line
wrapping, etc.

I suggest that if at all possible you find some text associated with the
beep that you can trigger on.

Is it possible to have a variable for just a world?  Some things like a
status variable, target, etc...

Thanks,

What about the people not using procmail (I mean these ones who even can't

If You answered to my letter, then You didn't understand what I said. I'm
trying to say the same thing You said just now. I didn't give an advice to
add another script to Your procmail. I gave an advice to edit tinyfugue
mailing list. But sorry about starting the topic at all. Now I feel myself
guilty in that [TF] nightmare. I only wished to ask, if it is possible to
add such a change to tinyfugue mailinglist, when I started the topic. I
didn't intend to start a war.

Your argumentation is lame, you do the same fault that i made and _you_ want
to explain me something ?
The only one you are doing is to flame. Ok. I have done a mistake.
But is there need to flame around ? I think your reply and the other replies
of the other lame flame-pleoples are even more annoying than my _one_ reply.
So shut up and flame to me myself and not to the list.

I highly doubt it unless you can do this:

/_test_%{1} <args>

if not then you'll have to parse it through an eval and face the possibility
of some security holes. With this it's simple. you reserve a seperate
namepsace for this stuff or, if you're going to use variables (ie define
them with /set or /setenv instead of /def and a switch) you don't even
have to do that. /execute grabs it, passes it the args and off it goes.
no extra processing and no extra security holes to worry about. I *don't*
want to give some twit out there control of my account. this, in my books,
is a Bad Thing[tm]. :)

Hello,

I'd like to change the prompt I get from my MUD but somehow I can not get it to
work. I don't know how I should use the hook for replacing the prompt.

The prompt I get looks like ^11 22 33 > $ (^ and $ just how start and end) and I
want to make it look like ^11 22 44 > $ where 44 is calculated by "constant -
33". All numbers have no fixed length so I have to use regex to match it, like
'^([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) > $' or something.

How can I alter the prompt to make it look like I want it?

Thanks for your help.

Harry

Thank you very much!! It looks so simple and I couldn't figure it out... :-\

Just one more question regarding it - how can I add a space after the ">"? When
I add a space to the end of line it gets ignored, when I put the string into ""
or '' they are shown as well.
I'd just want to have a space between the prompt and my cursor.

Thanks for your help.

Harry

Then you will have to use the prompt() function:

/def -mregexp -h'prompt ^([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) >' =\
	/test prompt(strcat(P1, " ", P2, " ", const - P3, "> "))

As long as the '/' is there, you _can_ do that, wherever variable
substitutions are allowed, without an extra /eval.  For example,

  /def execute = /_unique_prefix_%{1} %{-1}

And, even if an /eval were required, you could avoid early evaluation
(and potential security problems) by using the right % depth:

  /def execute = /let args=%{-1}%; /eval /_unique_prefix_%{1} %%{args}

Since you're never going to call the macro directly by hand, you can make
the prefix long and weird to minimize namespace conflicts.

There's no advantage to storing the body in a variable:  it would only move
the namespace conflicts from the macro space to the variable space.

I can't find something like /set -w <name> <value> (which would only define
the variable for one world), but you can of course use the world-name in
your variable name, something like
   /set eat_${world_name} mushroom
(this is inside a macro, else you have to put /eval in front of it I fear).

For world-dependent statusbars there have been posted some solutions, but I
can't find them right now, perhaps someone who uses them will post them if
you are interested.

But wait! There's more! :)

Thanks for the last bit of advice. Using it now and tho I feel it's a tad
messy it works real well and has allowed me to reorganise my script nicely.

But... I have come to another hassle. I need to be able to test for a control
char in a trigger. ie I need the trigger to be able to detect and activate
if it comes across whatever control char I have told it to look for (like
^g or ^h or whatnot). ATM it seems to be filtering them out which is rather
annoying as I really need to be able to detect them coming in (and send them
too). I've looked at /set emulation but that seems to be more how it handles
them when outputting to the screen rather then wether or not it filters
them out when it gets them from the telnet connection so well... I need help
here too. :)

Hope I'm not being a pest but I'm not jsut asking here without looking
through the helpfiles. I do actually try to RTFM. :)

If I type /signal by itself, according to the help, I should get a list 
of valid signals.  Instead, I get simply:

kill: bad signal number: 7809

(in this case, 7809 is the PID of the TF process)

I know how to get a list of signals, of course, but I thought I'd at 
least report this.  Using TF 4.0 alpha 4, Linux kernel 2.0.33, procps 1.2.2.

(And by the way... my .signature's not too long for you guys, is it?) :)

You aren't nearly as much as a pest than some on this list. I think you can
handle the RTFM part nicely. The next step is usually RTFS or Use The
Source :) But in your case I would suggest RTFML or Use The Mailing List
and I have a small example of the issue right here ;) :

I think you can send control characters without much hassle. Think there
was an option in send or send() to just send the characters without a final
newline.

Hope this helps ;)

Gah. this sucks muchly and in full totality. couldn't there be a way to
define a trigger so that it gets between in net input and tf's emulation
filters? And have a function that fiddles with the data caught to make it
fit properly to the preferred emulation (if need be). I most definately do
not wish to make the emulation raw because I connect to places where
ansi_attr is the preferred mode of doing things.

Also, this is the only way to catch the text WITHOUT insecure interferance
from other, uninvolved output.

Hello,

is there a way to make tf sleep for a certain amount of time (a few seconds)
before continueing a macro? I have some macros to config my account on the mud
and if the stuff I send gets too much test I get kicked out because of flooding.
:-) Something like "/sleep 3" for sleeping 3 seconds would help me to avoid
this.
Is there a way to do it within tf or should I do a system call or something?

Any ideas?

Harry

I believe the problem is that he needs to lag the command *before* it 
gets sent to the game.  If he spams the game with a bunch of @waits 
he's still gonna get booted.

I think /quote and /repeat let you specify delays.  Read the help 
on those commands and see if you can get it to do what you want.

Hi,

This might help:

From /help repeat:
...
 Since the first run is not done until after the first interval (for an
  asynchrounous /repeat), a useful trick is to use "/repeat -<time> 1
  <command>" to delay the execution of a single command.
...

Now that beta 19 of cygwin has been out for a few months. Is anyone
updating
TF for NT so that it has more of the missing features like /sh. Also I
beleive
someone was working on the problem of TF dropping the connection over
lag as well.

Thanks alot! /quote does exactly what I want! I didn't remember that there's a
command for sending files. :-\

PLEASE DO NOT REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE...

Please guys... with the growing number of members of this list,
discussions like this take place too often.

Having a long signature is not forbidden, it's just bad ettiquette. If
you care, keep it short. If you don't... well.

The emails about this matter took more space and download time than the
original question.

I quote this from the rules of the maillist:

=====
4) WHAT IS AND IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO POST (The Basics)

There are some other things you shouldn't post to this mailing list.  In
general, IF IT DOESN'T RELATE TO THE SUBJECT OF THE LIST, DON'T POST IT! 
=====

With this email, I break this rule and I do this on purpose. 

Basic ideas:
1> keep mails in-theme (tinyfugue)

Hi, Im a noobie to tf programming, and am having some trouble 
getting my code to work.  I would appreciate it if someone would take
a look and tell me what they think.

Im trying to write something that will let me change targets quickly and
show up in the status line.  Im using tf4.0, alpha4, on Debian Linux.

This targeting code is supposed to work by indexing into targlist (a
variable containing a list of targets) with targi, and assigning the
result to ktarg.  I have ktarg set up to show up in the status line.  I
initialized ktarg to "none" with set when I set up the status line, so it
should be a global variable.  When I get this working, I will add a targup
macro and put in some code to wrap if targup or targdown try to go past
the end of the list. 

I can get to code to work up to the last line if I replace the {} variable
dereferences with % derefrences in the last line.  As it is here, ktarg is
being set to the string "{targi}" in the first assignment and to the
numerical value of targi within targdown.

BTW, I am under the impression that "/test myvar:=" is the prefered way to
assign a value to myvar and {myvar} is the prefered way to dereference
myvar.  Is this correct?

Thanks
Mike Taylor, aka Trogon

I have configured majordomo to automatically prefix the Subject of all
mail on this list with "[TF]" (unless the subject already contains it).
Anybody who is using procmail or another mechanism to modify the Subject
themselves should stop doing so.

The general conclusion I drew from the recent discussion here was that
most readers would at least tolerate a short tag like "[TF]", and
having it done by the list software is much better than having various
readers mangle the Subject for everyone else.

	The compiler output generated doesn't necessarily indicate
this is the problem, but I've found that if you use an ANSI compiler
where you weren't before, alot of problems go away.  To kick HP's
compiler into full ANSI mode, use the options '-Aa -Ae'.  (I've just
recently foudn out that HP limits these options via licensing, so 
I hope yer licensed for their ansi compiler)  Or, alternatively, 
use, or get and compile, gcc and try with that instead.

	On a kinda side note, does the list support archives of

be easier to tell someone to check the archives than to

I don't think there's any 'official' archive anywhere, but it's about time
we got together a tinyfugue FAQ.

Ignore that.  The version of majordomo used by this list doesn't support it.

Any reader who modifies the Subject for his/her own viewing should restore
the Subject to its original form when replying to the list.

I received many of the same erors when compiling 4.0a3.  The problem was
fixed by adding CCFLAGS='-Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE' to the unix/Config file.  The

haven't bothered trying to install 4.0a4 after all that trouble with

I downloaded 4.0a4 after reading your message to give it an attempt
myself.  I entered the same flags and information to the Config file that
I had with 4.0a3, yet I still received the same errors that were mentioned
in the original message.  Upon reviewing what happened when I ran
'unixmake', I noticed the following error at the very start of the
process: 
  ./tfconfig: sh unixmake: not found

Because of this error, the options and flags set in the Config file were
not even read for compilation.  I presume the problem lies somewhere in
tfconfig and incorrect path settings.  Any help for us poor HP-UX folks? ;)

I had problems like this during the process of compiling tf for
Win32 using the Cygnus kit recently.  That one simply means that
the given sh command isn't found .. so replace it with the shell
you're using on the HP.

You'll (like the previous poster said) want the -DHPUX_SOURCE flag
in the CFLAGS section as well.. and there were a number of other
problems with the scripts that had to be fixed up too.  I think
those were mostly due to using the Cygnus bash shell, which lacks
a few features (executing multiple commands on the commandline
for one - both the Makefiles and the config scripts tend to do this,
so you have to split the lines up into different lines)

If you're really interested, I still have my hacked Makefile(s) and
tfconfig script lying around - mail me direct for them pls.

	I got no such error message.  Iplayed around quite a bit with
some compilers (cc and gcc) and compiler options.  I've concluded
that gcc is busted and/or installed incorrectly on my machine, since 
it can't even parse a system header.  Which is bad, cuz I've always
just used gcc to compile tf, since that's the easiest route.
	After playing a bit with HP's cc, I foudn that if you 
use their cc (by way of setenv CC/export CC or editing unix/Config)
and you do NOT specify the '-Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE' options, 
so the compile line is simply:
cc -O -c command.c 
those enumlist.h warnings go away.  However, the varlist.h errors 
still crop up whether or not you use the ANSI options.
	So, w/o hacking the source, your best bet is to get and
compile and install (correctly) gcc and use that.

...
[some time passes]
...

	Now, playing with it a bit more, I was able to get it to compile.
In variable.c, line 83, change:
    { name, val, val ? sizeof(val)-1 : 0, type, enums, ival, func, NULL, NULL }
to
    { name, val, sizeof(val), type, enums, ival, func, NULL, NULL }

	I tried strlen() first, but that went over worse than sizeof.
I took off the '-1' for the many NULL cases.  Apparantly, HP's compiler 
doesnt' like ternary operators in variable initilizers.  The wimps.  
TF compiled the rest of the way and I 'tested' it by starting it on my 
tf files (which set a whole bunch of variables).

*** THIS IN NO WAY MEANS THIS FIX IS CORRECT AND BUG FREE!! ***

	At best, this is a quick and dirty hack, only looking as far
as I needed to to find this fix, not looking where or what else this 
might affect.

	Honestly, the best thing for you to do is to get and use gcc.
However, if you like to live dangerously and dont' care about the very
real possibility of a core dump happening, then use this 'fix' at
your own risk.

Best of luck,
Mike

Some time ago someone posted a hook that turned the 
% mail stuff message

Into a oneline
% Mail FROM: blah  SUBJ: blahblah

Anyone remember this or can reinvent it?

(If someone wants to do one better than that, trunc'ing the strings so 
they could be used in variables for the Status line would even be better,
but I'm not going to get needy.)

I re-invented it.  What I do with my mail is this:

/def -ag -hMAIL auto-mailer = /sys mailcheck

'mailcheck' is just a simple perl script I wrote that goes through my
mailspool and prints out who my mail is from and what the subject is.
If you want a copy of the script, feel free to e-mail me off the
list.  Keep in mind that most Unixes have a 'from' or 'frm' command
which does pretty much the same thing, though.

So I try the following:

/DEF -hMAIL -p12 -aGg -i -q gag_mail =\
   /echo $[$(/sys grep From: /usr/spool/mail/ddickens | tail -1)]

It works... sort of...
There are two problems...
First, because of the /sys I get a '!' prefix instead of '% ' (the more 
typical feedback marker).
Second, now my (MAIL) doens't show up in my Visual Status Bar...
Any more suggestions?

Did you see my message to the list yesterday?  It uses a /sys also, so 
you won't get the '% ' prefix like you want (is there a specific
reason you need the '%' instead of a '!'?), but it does leave the
(Mail) message in the status bar.  At least, it leaves it in mine.

/list -i sys
% 8: /def -i sys = /quote -S -decho \\!!%{*-:}

If you don't want the !, then just call /quote directly.

Hi there,

i have 2 major probs.

1) I get a prompt from my mud. it looks like this

| 547H 190M 240V > 

i want to store the first and the second number in variables Hp and Sp
then i want to modify the prompt, so that i can get some more
informations, for instance 

| 547H 190M 240V (xxx) (yyy)> 

and xxx and yyy tells me if some spells are active or not, i have some
variables too, where spellstatus is logged. 1 for active, 0 for !active

perhaps someone of u can give me a hint, or an example how to do this.

2.) sometimes i just want to repeat the last command i entered in the
mud with a trigger.
an example: i want to disarm a trap, but i fail.
You miserably fail in disarming the trap. -> then i want to repeat with
a trigger the last disarm command: disarm trap , disarm rock or disarm
web or so ... anyone got an idea ?

-Dusty-

P.S. sorry my bad english :(

Try this:

/trig *You miserably fail in disarming the* = !

! is often used on mud. It repeats the last command entered by the
character. It might work on yours.

I have a minor problem.  The watch script, packaged with tf, will prevent
someone from idling out if they forget to log out. This recently happened
to myself.  I was wondering if anyone here has written a script which will
automatically log someone out after x minutes of local keyboard activity?

OK, I use the following bit for doing spells (It watches for a message
saying the spell wore off, then casts the spell every 6 seconds (or is it
15?) until it sees the successful cast message. The downside is ou have to
write a new version for every spell. If needed, I have a perl script that
spits out exactly what should be added to the file. You should be able to
modify this for your needs.

/def -w<world> -mglob -t'<wearoff message>' \
     wearoff_<world_name>_<skill name> = \
     /recast_<world_name>_<skill name>

/def -w<world> -mglob -t'<succeed message>' \
     succeed_<world_name>_<skill name> = \
     /set spellon_<world_name>_<skill name> 1

/def recast_<world_name>_<skill name> = \
     /set spellon_<world_name>_<skill name> 0 %; \
     /untildone_<world_name>_<skill name>

/def untildone_<world_name>_<skill name> = \
     /if (spellon_<world_name>_<skill name> = 0) \
         /repeat -w<world> -00:00:00 1 cast '<spell name>' %; \
         /repeat -00:00:15 1 /untildone_<world_name>_<skill name> %; \
     /endif


Anything in <>'s should be replaced with something appropriate. Note
multi-word world names/skill names should likely be deliminated by _'s not
spaces in anything that is not send to the MUD. Comments accepted. :)

Maybe you could use /set last_trapname=<trapname> in the macro that
failed and the use 

/def -t'*You miserably fail in disarming the*' \
  = /eval /send disarm %{last_trapname}

I hope the sytax is correct ;)

In response to the person who wanted a way of repeating the last command,
whether a macro or a mud command, etc:

/def again=\
  /let line=$(/recall -i -- -3) %;\
  /eval -s%sub %line

You can make this a binding (to a key-press like esc-a) if you wish, by:
/def -b'^[a' bind_again=\
  /let line=$(/recall -i -- -2) %;\
  /eval -s%sub %line


(Note the macros are slightly different as typing "/again" counts as another
command (that you don't want to repeat, but the one before it) but a binding
doesn't.)

Isn't this already implemented with Esc-p?

Yes.

Seeing the code behind it can be useful though, if, say, the user wishes to
modify the macro so that only the last command matching a specific pattern
is run again, etc.

Hiya everyone,

I play a mud where I have a main character and 2 other multis I use. The
problem is that they all group together and fight together. When I want to
switch to my other characters I get all the spam from what happened while
on another character's world.

Is there a way to GAG all that happens in one given world while I am not
using it and cut the gag when I switch back? Or just gaging a specific
world for everything, even when i am using it.

Thanks in advance. I already tried a general /gag * but it gags all for
all worlds.

I'd recommend dispensing with the prompt and using the status line in
visual mode. To do that, put something like this in your ~/.tfrc :

/visual on
/set isize=2
/set cleardone=on

Next, to answer your question:
(this is a modified version of Susan Dittmar's code from an earlier post)

/def -i -F -mregexp -h'PROMPT [|] ([0-9]+)H ([0-9]+)M ([0-9]+)V >' h_prompt
= \
  /set hp=%{P1}%;\
  /set sp=%{P2}%;\
  /set mv=%{P3}

/set status_fields @world:12 hp:6:B :2 sp:4:B :2 mv:5:B :1 @more:8:Br \
  :1 @clock:5 
/set status_var_hp pad(hp,-4,"hp",2)
/set status_var_sp pad(sp,-3,"sp",1)
/set status_var_mv pad(mv,-3,"mv",2)

To add other variables to the status line (eg. spell affects), see /help
status_fields.

Also, if your mud is anything like mine, you will sometime get "broken
prompts" where the prompt is followed immediately by text, which can make
things look ugly and mess up your triggers. To fix that use this:

/def -F -mregexp -t'^[|] ([0-9]+)H ([0-9]+)M ([0-9]+)V >' t_broken_prompt = \
  /trigger -hPROMPT %{P0}%;\
  /substitute %{PR}

In case you do not like/want visual mode, you can use the following in
combination with the above trigger as well:

;set the list of your most important spell affects, this is just an example
;you would have flag variables matching the names, and the names must be
;one word in length
/set spells=haste sanc

/def make_spell_str = \
  /let str=%;\
  /while ({#}) \
    /if /eval /test %{1}%;\
      /then /test str := strcat({str},' ','(',{1},')')%;\
    /endif%;\
  /done%;\
  /return {str}

/def -i -F -mregexp -h'PROMPT [|] ([0-9]+)H ([0-9]+)M ([0-9]+)V >' h_prompt
= \
  /set hp=%{P1}%;\
  /set sp=%{P2}%;\
  /set mv=%{P3}%;\
  /let str=$[substr({P0},0,-1)]%;\
  /let aux=$[make_spell_str {spells}]%;\
  /test str := strcat({str},{aux},'>')%;\
  /prompt %{str}

Repeating the last command is not a good idea in this case, what if you
switched to a background world, looked at a help file, or whatever right
before the trigger activated. Also in this case the trigger will give you
all the information you need. E.g.:

/def -F -mregexp -t'^You miserably fail in disarming (the |a
)?([A-z]+)[.]$' t_fail_disarm = \
  disarm %{P2}

You may want it to give up if it fails 10 times or whatever. Then you'd use
something like this:

/alias disarm \
  /set disarm_attempts=0%;\
  /send disarm %{*}

/def -F -mregexp -t'^You miserably fail in disarming (the |a
)?([A-z]+)[.]$' t_fail_disarm = \
  /if (disarm_attempts < 10) \
    /send disarm %{P2}%;\
    /test disarm_attempts := disarm_attempts++%;\
  /else \
    /echo The %{P2} does not want to be disarmed it seems! %;\
  /endif

See /help regexp, /help substitution and /help evaluation for more info on
these painful looking characters :-)

Use /world -q whatever to switch worlds and not have tf show buffered output. 
You might want to definie keybindings (/help bind) for worlds you switch to
commonly.
Also use these gags:

/def -ag -F -hBACKGROUND g_background
/def -ag -F -hACTIVITY g_activity

I noticed that this wont work, because my prompt is colored, and i 
always get the colorcodes when i try to trigger the prompt

Greetings.

I'm trying to set up a series of triggers to automate part of a quest
that I intend to help run fairly often.  When a person dies in the
quest, the room I'm in will receive:

Name has been defeated in the arena.

I catch this with:
/def -p1 -mregexp -t' has been defeated in the arena.' arrive = whois
%1 %; /set char_name=%1

and

/def -p1 -mregexp -t'[* Hero] * BLUE' blue = b $[char_name]

(Is there a way to leave the space between the []'s blank? That
section is designed to match text which will be a variation of:
[999 Hero Hum M])

b is an alias on the mud which echoes something and transports the
character somewhere.

Will this method get screwed up if say I get 3 defeated messages at
once?  ie, if a blue, red and green die one after the other, will the
triggers act on blue first, then red, then green?  Or is there a
possibility that red will end up where blue should go?  If so, how to
make sure that doesn't happen?

Thanks.

Maybe
 /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^(.*) has been defeated in the arena.$' \
   arrive = /set char_name=%{P1}
could do this job a bit easier ...

And the above string is matched by
 /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^\\[([0-9]+) (.*) (.*) (.*)\\]$' \
   blue = b ${char_name}

Where the variables %{P1} holds 999,
                    %{P2} holds Hero,
                    %{P3} holds Hum,
                    %{P4} holds M,
if you need to specify the content of one pair of brackets (I hope ( and
) are
named brackets) simply replce them by the string you need.
E.g.:
 /def -p1 -mregexp -t'^\\[([0-9]+) Hero (.*) BLUE\\]$' \
   blue = b ${char_name}
will match [1333 Hero Dwa BLUE] 
( [<not empty string of numbers> Hero <any string> BLUE] )

Nope they should work on one after the other since the first string
which arrives TF will fire the trigger, then the second and so on.

I hope it was a bit what you wanted to know. If not you could give some
more examples or be a bit more specific ;)

I posted awhile back about help with a bracket counter.  Since no one 
could help me, I tryed it by myself.  It works, although, not quite how I 
like it.  Now, there's a limit of about 80 brackets that it can count.  
Here's the code, and if anyone can, please suggest improvments.


/def -q -ib^[B = /DO_COUNT_BRACKETS

/def -q -i DO_COUNT_BRACKETS = \
	/let LBrack1=0%; \
	/let RBrack1=0%; \
	/let LBrack2=0%; \
	/let RBrack2=0%; \
	/let LBrack3=0%; \
	/let RBrack3=0%; \
	/let i=0%; \
	/while (i<kbpoint()) \
	  /let char=$[substr(kbhead(),i,1)] %; \
	  /if (char=~'(') \

Hello this is meant to be a serious question. What do you use the bracket
counter for? If it's just to count the number of brackets in a file, why
not write it in c. I'm probably overlooking something.

Well, if you don't mind it doing this for -all- worlds, you can just
/set bg_output=off.  I used to do this when I MUDded, but I've since

In MUSH softcode, at least, it's often nigh impossible to keep track
of all of your brackets and parenthesis when you're coding stuff by
hand.  I'm sure other types of softcode have this same problem, but I
haven't played with those.

Yet.

Muahahahahah.

A better question - why do you want to know the specific count?
The built-in binding esc-hyphen will do bracket/brace/parenthesis matching
for you.

Soemthing else that might be as effective would be a status bar item
stating how many, and which types, of brackets were outstanding (unmatched).

Hello so are these files that your writing your code in  text files then
you could just write a little program that would read the file and count
them at least that's what I would do

Is there a package you have to load to get this functionality?  My tf
just beeps at me.  Or maybe I'm not quite understanding how to use it?

I'm trying to keep from setting off my own triggers...
But my current technique is not working...
Any suggestions?
I use:

/DEF -t'^(You|Bob) '     -p5 -i -q block_triggers

/DEF -i -Fp2 -c50 -Pu -t'[Cc]heese' -q cheese = \
	:mmms, "cheese on a stick."

/DEF -i -Fp2 -c50 -Pu -t'[Dd]o(ugh)?nut' -q doughnut = \
	:mmms, "old-fashioned, glazed doughnuts."

The block needs to be a higher priority trigger than the triggers it is
blocking.  Try -p5000. :)

PS. -mglob -t'{You|Bob}*' will work fine for the block as well (globbing is
generally faster than regular expressions).

PPS. Haven't seen you around cavemuck lately, Bob.

Wow this was a hard one to figure out :) An obscure bug. You have
%matching=glob. These are all regexp matches and do not mean anything
useful in glob matches. However, the reason why your cheese and doughnut
triggers still work is that -P (partial hilite) implies -mregexp by the
documentation, so they will be regexp matches, even though you didn't
notice it.

So just put -mregexp in your block_triggers trigger and all will be fine.

  ftp://tf.tcp.com/pub/tinyfugue/ and ftp://ftp.tcp.com/pub/mud/Clients/tf/


CHANGES:

4.0 alpha 5 (4/9/98)
-----------
Added /result, which behaves like /return or /echo depending on context.
Added -c"command" startup option.  See /help tf.
The "n" attribute turns off pre-existing attributes.  See: /help attributes.
Added addworld() function (which can accept arguments containing spaces).
Replaced builtin /echo with echo().
Tiny* LOGIN hooks put quotes around a character or password containing spaces.
Added %binary_eol to determine end of line marker in TELNET BINARY mode.
Added "proxy" and "login" world fields (for use as world_info(<field>) or
  $world_<field>).
Added tfflush(); tfwrite() flushes automatically by default.
Added morescroll().
Command line option -n is overridden by <world> or <host> <port>.
Added -s option to /quote ` to control the substitution level.
Added -rqw options to /ps.
Duplicate input lines are not suppressed by /log -i.
Filename completion (complete.tf) handles names starting with "~/".
The names of bodyless triggers are mecho'd.
Error messages during /load report the range of line numbers, not just the
  misleading last line number, of the multiline command containing the error.
Workaround for broken compilers that failed initialization at variable.c:86.
Fixed evaluation of command in /qtf (in quoter.tf).
Fixed /restrict security hole in tfopen(). (40a1)

seems like there's a small install error in tf 4.0a5... nothing major, when
I did unixmake and it asks me if everything was ok, I typed no, and I got:

*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `_log'

this was under SunOS 4, if it matters.

I am using the tinyfugue keybindings stuff quite a lot. The thing I am
suggesting does not seem to be too hard to implement by looking at the
source. The tinyfugue code seems quite clean actually.

We all have used an editor 'vi' and know it's command mode and input modes.
I have quite a similar thing built in tf. Normally the client is in command
mode. I have keybinding for most main keyboard keys (for example, I use the
tyu-ghj-bnm island for normal navigation with look in the center and
TYU-GHJ-BNM for walking). I have also multi-key binds like 'cb' 'cs' 'cc'
which correspond to inputting my channels 'bat ' 'sales ' 'chat ' etc. How
this is implemented is that I have a couple separate files, general.tf,
command.tf and input.tf. In general I have defined some keybindings like ^y
for changing between the modes. All the keybindings are defined with a
common word, cbind and ibind, in them so I can just /purge cbind_* and
/purge ibind_* when I change modes. This all works perfectly, altho I would
wish for a way to disable a keybinding, like you can disable a trigger by
saying -c0, since all this loading and purging is kinda demanding on the
machine. But anyway, I never thought this would even be possible but it
works and I'm very pleased.

Now I have a problem. Ofcourse I don't have a keybinding for every key
imaginable. Let us say that I didn't have a keybinding for the key 'w'
(this would be something like '\' in reality). Now when I press key 'w', it
puts it in the inputbuffer. What I would ultimately want for it to do is to
beep and echo to tferr that "No such keybinding 'w'". Ofcourse the problem
is easily remedied by me defining a binding for 'w' but I would not want to
make bindings for all 255 keys. What I would want is:

/def -i -BDEFAULT cbind_default = /eval /echo -e - No such keybinding '%*'.

Ofcourse, typing this without any keybindings to undef that would make
typing anything impossible as the normal self_insert kind of function for
the keys would be redefined.

I do not know if Ken wants to implement this by doing yet another entry in
his keynode table or just make a special case around the part he discovers
that there are no keybindings matching that key (keyboard.c, line 196,
after builtin matches (we don't want to be default to those)). Ofcourse, he
knows how he wants to implement it, if he wants to implement it, but I do
offer my help in his task if he wants it.

Actually all my bindings are not that simple, I have a commandmode that
bounces back to commandmode after any inputmode stuff and a commandmode
that is only temporarily on and minor modes and major modes etc. Hope you
got the idea from that though.

I've got a5 successfully compiled against both the Cygnus b18 and b19.1
dll's and will be making both available this weekend as binary installers
for Windows 95 and NT.

Since I noticed that a6 is out, I will do that one as well, and put them up.
For anyone diehard enough to want to test these and install them yourselves,
I'll happily give you the bins in the mail to work with until I get the
installers polished and shipped out.

Looks like TF for BeOS is also only a matter of weeks away as well.  Those
modifications are more serious though, as the MetroWerks GCC is a little
less than optimal.

Hello,

since I installed 40b6 (40b5 had the same problem) the complete.tf does no
longer work.
When I type <tab> to complete the word I just typed it inserts ALL matches it
finds. In version 40a4 it displayed the possible matches and waited for more
input.

How can complete.tf be used again?

Harry

I was just wondering:

I'm on a game where one of the command prefixes is ^
Naturally, this conflicts with the ^pattern^replacement command-line thingy,
which I can get around by using /send ^command, I know--but I was wondering if
this was simply not possible to override?

I mean, I know I can //command if the MU* uses / as a command prefix, but ^
seems to be less forgiving.

Having just upgraded to the new alpha I find a problem - stuff that has
been /echo'd to screen now disappears if I do a /recall.

It didn't do that before!

Bug or (mis-)feature?  It breaks my IRC scripts :(

I can't duplicate this, so you'll have to give more detail.  "/echo text"
still appears in local and global history, but not world history, the
same as it would in 40a4.

/echo -w is known to be broken in 40a6, but other than that /echo should
work the same as in 40a4.

For those of you who can't wait for 40a7, here's a version of /echo that
fixes the -w bug:

/def -i echo = \
    /if (!getopts("a:poerw:", "")) /return 0%; /endif%; \
    /return echo({*}, opt_a, !!opt_p, \
        (opt_w !~ "") ? strcat("w",opt_w) : opt_e ? "e" : opt_r ? "r" : "o")

Ahh, that was what I meant.  Sorry for the unclear report.  And
thanks for the fix :)

Hello everyone.  I've got experience with tinyfugue but that was long ago.
I quit mudding, but now I'm back.

Here's my delima.  I cant quite understand when to use %% when defining
triggers.  I want a macro that will create a trigger then undefine that
trigger when the macro completes. 

i.e.  when I type /look n I want to look north. Then if a certain mob is
to the north I want to append something to a string. When finished I want
to say to everyone in my group what I saw. 

I want to create a file specific to each similar zone for these macros
where the only difference is in the mob names, etc.

Ok, here's how the whole thing works.   I type /la  which will look into
every adjoining room.

/def la = /look n%;/look s%;/look e%;/look w%;/look u%;/look d

/def look = look %{1} \
   /set MOBSTR=$[strcat(toupper(substr(%{1},0,1)), ":" )] \
   /def -mregexp -t'^(\\*J|J)uiblex, .*$' juiblex = \
      /set MOBSTR=$[strcat(%MOBSTR, "  <<< JUIBLEX >>>" )]
   /def -mregexp -t'^(\\*D|D)emogorgon, .*$' demog = \
      /set MOBSTR=$[strcat(%MOBSTR, "  <<< DEMOGORGON >>>" )]

   (more definitions here for different mobs names)
   /def -mregexp -t'^<' display = \
      /if ($[strlen(%MOBSTR)] > 2) gsay %MOBSTR %;/endif%;/unset MOBSTR
/* end of definition */

Actually, I'd prefer to use glob instead of regexp.

This is actually taken from an old set of triggers I set up once that did
work but not set up like they are here.  I may be doing my definitions
wrong in this example but you get the picture of what I'm trying to do.

When I look into a room in one particular zone these are the
possibilities:

*Juiblex, the Faceless Lord, Prince of Demons, is traveling here in astral
form.
*Demogorgon, Prince of all Demons, is traveling here in astral form.
*A beautiful Succubus devil stands here, smiling evilly at you.
*A huge Marilith Deamon is standing here.
*A dark Shadow Daemon floats here, shifting in and out.
*A huge Smoke Elemental floats along here, ready to strike.
A horrid looking Gray Slaad stand here.
You sense a lifeform here.  

* in front the name means the mob is invisibile. If that mob had attacked
someone already he is no longer invis and hence, no * before it's name.
lifeform is if I have sense life spell cast on me and my detect invis wore
out.

A room can contain several different mobs of the same name, i.e.

look north
The astral plane continues.
The Astral Plane
Room size: Tiny (L:5 ft  W:5 ft  H:5 ft)
Exits: -N -E -S -W -U -D
A horrid looking Gray Slaad stand here.
*A dark Shadow Daemon floats here, shifting in and out.
*A dark Shadow Daemon floats here, shifting in and out.
A horrid looking Gray Slaad stand here.
A horrid looking Gray Slaad stand here.
< 618h/594H 239v/239V >

So if this is what I saw in one of the rooms when I do /la which then
calls /look n
I want to tell the group:

gsay N: Slaad, Shadow, Shadow, Slaad, Slaad

or even better would be:

gsay N: Slaad(3), Shadow(2)

And even better yet would be able to look into every adjoining room and
put all possibilities in one gsay.  i.e. if I look north and theres a
Slaad and a Shadow, and to the east is a Marillith, and up is Demogorgon,
I would like to be able to:

gsay N: Slaad, Shadow; E: Marillith; U: <<< Demogorgon >>>

I think it's workable but it's a lotta work :P

Thanks to anyone who can help.

In one of the most recent versions, /listworlds changed its output.  It
now gives a list of
/test addworld(...)
instead of the cleaner looking output it used to.  Not a high priority
item, but it would be nice if it could be fixed in a later version.

I log all my mud sessions automatically, and also use the tick.tf when I
play. I find the tick messages extremely useful, but I dont want them in
the log...especially when I fall asleep and leave the session running for 3
hours ;)

-aG does not prevent logging, so is there some attribute I am missing to
not log this? I do want to see it on the screen, however, there are
numerous /echos that I _do_ want in the log. Is there any way to do this
easily? The only way I have thought of (incidentally I did try -aG just to
see if docs were wrong, they arent) is to rewrite the tick echos in tick.tf
to turn off logging, but if these play w/ the sockets that would incur a
lot of overhead every 30 seconds.

Any ideas?

I havent actually done this but intend to try it soon.  Consider using
the latest (alpha) version of tf with the configurable status bar.  Do
away with echoed tic messages and put a tic counter in the status bar.
I think this could be done by redefining a few things, like tic_action,
after loading tick.tf.  You still have your tick info while playing, but 
no tick messages in your logs.
Hope this is useful
Mike

Hi, new to the list..
 
Looking for a way to set my number keypad as directions so 8 would be north
2 would be south 1 would be north/west Etc:. I want to press the key and
move IE: there should be a RETURN or NEWLINE included in the keypress

Oh ya, just to add some fun to this little quest. I am using Tinyfugue
on an Amiga 4000/40 running Linux.........

The mapping I have for escape-enter:

/def -b'' = \
   /recordline -i $[strcat(kbhead(), kbtail())]%;\
   /dokey DLINE

seems to have broken in the latest Alpha?

My bindings for esc-return are fine:
/def -b'^[^j' ...
/def -b'^[^m' ...

and your /recordline line looks fine.

I've just had another go at getting the SOCKS support with 40a-4 to
work. Unfortunately I'm still having problems. rtelnet definitely works
(because that's what I'm trying to replace :).

I'm using socks5

The compilation seemed to work fine, this is the linker test  ....

Creating linker test...
Will link with -lnsl for gethostbyname().
Will link with -lsocket for connect(), etc.
Will link with -lresolv.
rm -f a.out; cc -O libtest.o -lsocks -lresolv -lsocket -lnsl
Will link with -lsocks.
Will link with -ltermcap.

Any clues anyone ?

Im new to this list today, my curiosity regarding TF overcoming my dread
surrounding the volume of mailing list mail traffic...

I have 3 questions;

- Is there anyone out there using TF to make calls to a database?
Im thinking of something like TF seeing lines from a world including a
description like "adolescent long-haired elf" grabbing that as a regexp
and getting the player's name from a databse. I guess you could do it
with grep and a flat fil, but that might be real slow?

- Anyone done any work integrating TF and another programming
environment (eg Prolog) , for NL parsing of stuff from a world? Im
particularly interested in black-box/nueral network type approaches to
this... 

- Does anyone use TF for system admin tools?

Do let me know if any of these interest you.

Thanks

Oliver

PS now that version 4 seems to require some changes in the code I have
been working on over the years, its the right time for me to get stuck
in again :)

Hello, I hope I don't start a minor war with this message, but last summer
before I knew that tinyfugue exzisted, I was using tintin for a client,
then I changed servers and the new one has tf. I'm trying to use the tt.tf
files so that I don't have to rewrite all my tt code, with problems. Has
anyone done that? It says all the tintin commands are usable but for
example /var doesn't work and I'm having problems using tt aliases to set
variables in the tf variables. Thought someone out there might have done
this.
Kevin

Unless you have a large number of data, a heavy-duty database manager
won't be noticably faster than a flat file or TF macro system.  The TF
language is not terribly efficient, but using it would avoid the overhead
of shelling out to access a database manager or grep a file.  There are
at least a couple different ways of implementing a database table in tf:

* Make each db entry a variable, like this:

  /set Bob_desc=You see an adolescent long-haired elf.

  Then you can get a list of variables that match "adolescent long-haired elf"
  like this:

  /listvar -mregexp -s _desc$$ adolescent long-haired elf

  This method can be extended to other "columns" by choosing appropriate
  variable names, like <name>_age, <name>_hp, <name>_is_hostile.
  One problem with this method is that <name> must fit within TF's variable
  naming restrictions (but this can be overcome by encoding <name>).
  You could also use macros instead of variables; macro names have fewer
  restrictions.

* Create a bogus world, and make each db row a macro that sets variables
  for each column, and use the primary index as a trigger in the bogus
  world.  Here's a stripped-down example from a recent project of mine:

  /addworld calendar bogus bogus
  /def -p10 -mregexp -wcalendar -t"^[Nn]ew +[Yy]ear'?s +[Ee]ve$$" = \
      /test description:="New Year's Eve", month:=12, day:=31
  /def -p1 -wcalendar -t"*" = \
      /test description:="Unknown day", month:=0, day:=0

  Then you can search on the primary key like this:

  /trigger -wcalendar new years eve

  and the variables description, month, and day will be set appropriately.
  The biggest disadvantage of this method is that you can search ONLY on
  the primary key.  Also, the position of the regexp is reversed:  the
  searcher gives only a simple string, and the primary key regexp has to
  anticipate all possible spellings the searcher might use.

TF's triggers can be used like rules of a production system, using
trigger priority to define the conflict resolution strategy.  The
second db example above shows how you might start such a system; each
trigger could continue the chain by calling /trigger again (maybe into a
different rule set (bogus world)).  The details are left as an exercise
for the reader. :)

> - Does anyone use TF for system admin tools?

I've used TF to upload config files to a Gauntlet firewall, and
occasionally taken advantage of TF's features to quickly write scripts
in TF that would've taken more work in /bin/sh (maybe I could've used
perl, but I know TF better than perl).

heh, rather embarrassing really, but...  there was a post here recently that
had no info other than a web page that had some tf macros in it. the page ended
in .diff. see, i loaded it in my web browser, deleted the mail (in pine, unix),
then the browser crashed. excuses excuses.  could someone re-send the web
address please?

and btw, has no-one been keeping a tf-list archive? :/

Hello I'm trying to write some triggers to substitute text so that less
text scrolls on the screen in battle and so far what I've tried doesn't
seem to work so I thought I'd see if someone on here has already done it I
included a few examples so maybe someone can see what's wrong


/trigger You?crush*entire?body* = /substitute You kill it!

/trigger *dodges?out?of?the?way?of* = /substitutes dodges!

/trigger You?try?to?crush* = /substitute Avoids you!


Thanks

I got bored the other day and got tf 40a7 to compile, using the GNU-WIN32
tools. If anyone would like a copy, (So you do not have to dl 13+ megs) you
can get it from http://www.zor.com/tf-40a7.zip, this should be complete,
follow the readme and it should work. If it doesn't, let me know, I might
figure it out.

Use /trig instead of /trigger, because /trigger would only fire an
existing trigger that matches e.g. "You?crush*entire?body*". /trig is
used to define a new trigger.

Hello!

I have two little problems with /substitute:

1) /substitute deletes leading spaces. I want to remove the prompts of my
mud, but the number of following spaces is important to some triggers, so
I don't want to lose those spaces.

2) Sometimes I want the /substitute'd line to have a different colour than
the triggered one, or to make a previously gaged line visible again.

Is it possible to build in a function substitute() similar to echo(), so
that one can substitute text with leading spaces and add attributes to the
text after the trigger is called?


Thanks in advance,
Stephan

Any command or macro can be called as a function, if there is no explicitly
documented function with the same name.  So, just call substitute(), and
leading/trailing spaces will be preserved.

Accepting attributes would require modification; I'll consider it.

It said /echo -w was fixed in the change log for 4.0a7, but triggers that
call /echo -w still spit out the text in the current world rather than the
world that the trigger occurred in. Are those types of triggers now
required to have to use the echo() format instead?

I tried looking at /echo, and it seems that it's getopts()' fault, it can't
tell the difference between having an option but no string after it, and
not including the option at all. Or is it something else?

First of all, I wonder should we use $(/first %something) still or is there
going to be an update to the function that allows us to write
$[first(something)] in stdlib.tf. This ofcourse goes for all of the stuff
there.

Then, second, I'd like to inquire, how are we supposed to match a trigger
without attributes. My previous code used to /list -i -an something_*, but
before I go correcting my triggers, I would like to know if we are to
differentiate between "/def -an something" and "/def something". This also
might be a bug but I haven't got the brainpower now to think it over.

Nuttin much,

That is the correct behaviour of /echo.

  command: -w<world> 
  function: <dest> = "w<world>" 
          Echo <text> to the <world> stream instead of the default tfout 
          stream (see tfio).  If <world> is blank, the current world is 
          assumed.  

If you want to echo to the trigger world, use -w${world_name}.

Oops, I am mistaken.

Yes, it does look like getopts() is hoopy here.

Using to the definitions in "/help sockets", you mean "foreground", not
"current".  (Easy mistake, but we should all use the same terminology
to avoid confusion.)

In 40a7, "/echo -w<world>" was fixed, but "/echo -w" (with no "<world>")
was still broken (in a different way).

This problem does indeed involve getopts().  (It could be argued that
the real problem is that the argument to -w was optional, violating the
traditional unix rules for options, but we're stuck with that now).  It
will be fixed in the next release, but for now, here's a version of
/echo that doesn't have the problem:

/def -i echo = \
    /let opt_a=%; \
    /let opt_w=()%; \
    /let opt_p=0%; /let opt_o=0%; /let opt_e=0%; /let opt_r=0%; \
    /if (!getopts("a:poerw:")) /return 0%; /endif%; \
    /return echo({*}, opt_a, !!opt_p, \
        (opt_w !~ "()") ? strcat("w",opt_w) : opt_e ? "e" : opt_r ? "r" : "o")

(I chose "()" because it is not a legal world name.)

but it gives me the

instead. 

warning message - just the once :-) I dont understand it. I tried
replacing all =/ with =~ but still the same warning. Where is the
substitution happening? How would I fix it?

I think you would fix it by replacing every occurrence of

(%1 =/ "foo")

with 

({1} =/ "foo")

Read /help substitution for more info.

Hope this helps.

There appears to be a problem with highlighting in the status bar when
on non-ansi terminals.  Actually, a lot of the highlighting stuff has
been kaput on non-ansi, but this one is getting through my fixes.

I sometimes need to use an ADM3e-br terminal.  It is distinctly
non-ansi.  Any ANSI stuff is displayed as the character sequence
constituting the escape code.  /set emulation ansi_strip is not enough.
I have a check in my startup which also does a /purge Hilite* and I
consistently name my triggers to start thus.  I also do a /nohilite

I used to also need to clear all the variables containing the colour
escapes.  This is no longer in the latest stuff (thanks :^) however,
with or without this, attributes in the status line still make it
through, mangled.  Given that the trigger-stuff has been fixed, is this
something easy to remedy?

Thanks.

PS: Ta for making Tinyfugue even better, Ken.  :^)

Hello everyone,

		I have another question about /echo.

You see I use some triggers to indicate when my spells run out.

Example: /trig *You feel weaker* = groupsay -->Strength out<--

I would like, instead of groupsaying it, to /echo it on the screen of the
foreground (the world i am currently using). I would also like, in the
/echo, the name of the world where it originated from. I tried a few
things but i can't seem to specify the world where it came from.

maybe we could start with this:

/trig *You feel weaker* = /echo -w"fg" Strength spell out in worldX

I know -wfg doesn't work but I don't know how to specify the current
world, i added it so you could understand what I mean.

WorldX would be the variable or something like that that would send back
the world where the trigger originated from to the foreground.

Any hints on this?

try this:

You should also give your trigger a name.

why not change your color.tf (yeah, crazy American spelling) so that there
aren't any escape codes in the variables defined, or change them around for
your terminal? Or you can keep two versions around for when you're back on
an ansi terminal.

Hi, 

I playing in a MUD with ANSI-Colors.
There i have a colored Prompt, and i want to read some
values from it. Here is the Promptstring:

| [[0;XXmYYY[[0;0mH [[0;XXmYYY[[0;0mM [[0;XXmYYY[[0;0mV >

XX are the Colorcodes between 31 and 36 ,
YYY are the values, that i want to read out.

But i want also see the original Prompt from the Mud.

Thanks for helping !!

Martin

The solution:

--<snip>--
/def -iq -mregexp -t"^\\| \033\\[0;3[1-6]m([0-9-]+)\033\\[0;0mH \
                          \033\\[0;3[1-6]m([0-9-]+)\033\\[0;0mM \
                          \033\\[0;3[1-6]m([0-9-]+)\033\\[0;0mV >" \
	prompt_hook = \
	/set var1=%P1%; \
	/set var2=%P2%; \
	/set var3=%P3
--<snip>--

-i         makes invisible
-q makes   it to still show the prompt
-mregexp   matching regular expression
^          beginning of string
\\|        we have to escape the '|'
\033       = ^[ = esc = the starter code for ansi colors... you seem to
           have just [ in your example, but this should be the right form.
\\[        we need to escape the '['
[1-6]      any number from 1 to 6
[0-9]      any number or '-' sign
+          match previus symbol one or more times
( )        expressing grouping... puts values in %P1 - %P9 in order
var1-3     variables which contain the values H M and V, respectively

Hope this helps, if there's any bugs, tell me.

Hello,

I defined the following gag which is supposed to just save some information to
variables and should not display anything.
The line below does everything like expected but it displays an empty line. Any
idea why?

/def -ag -mregexp -t'^blah (.*) of (.*) (is|are) blah\.$' = \
        /set myvar=$[tolower(strcat({P1}, "/", {P2}))]

Any idea where the empty line comes from?

Harry

Hello,

I use a prompt hook to calculate a few things which I like to see on my prompt.
Now for some reason the prompt seems to flicker. To examine that I set mecho=all
and found out that the hook is constantly called. I got lines over lines of
debug output showing my prompt hook called.
What can cause this? As far as I understood that hook it only gets called if a
new prompt from the MUD arrives.

Any hints are welcome.

Harry

I clear all the colour variables.  That's the point -- the status-line

The %{emulation} variable determines whether ANSI attribute codes received
from a server are stripped or converted to TF's intneral form.  Attributes
generated from within TF (/echo -a, triggers, %status_fields, etc.) are
always in TF's internal form, and %{emulation} has no effect on them.

TF deals with two kinds of display attributes:  "simple" (bold, underline,
reverse, flash, dim) and color.  TF gets the codes for the simple
attributes from your system's termcap (or terminfo) datbase, according to
the value of the %{TERM} variable; so it is important that you have %{TERM}
set correctly.  Because most termcaps don't include color codes, TF gets
those codes from the %{start_color_*} and %{end_color} variables.

TF uses these codes when it needs to display an attribute (in internal
form) on your terminal.  %{TERM} determines how simple attributes are
displayed, and %{start_color_*} determines how colors are displayed.

If your terminal does not support the simple attribute codes defined in
termcap (eg, you see mangled codes instead of underline/reverse/bold on
your screen), then either your system's termcap database is buggy, or
you're using the wrong value for %{TERM}.  I think this is the problem
you are having.

If your terminal does not support ANSI color codes, you should set the
start_color_* variables to codes that are supported by your terminal, or
unset them.  For example, add this to your .tfrc:

  /if (TERM =~ "ADM3e-br") \
      /quote -S /unset `/listvar -s start_color_*%; \
      /unset end_color%; \
  /endif

Note that some terminals display simple attributes (as defined by their
termcap entry) in color.  For example, sending a vt100 underline code to
some DOS vt100 emulators will produce magenta text.  As far as TF is
concerned, that is underline, not magenta, and the terminal emulator is
wrong.  I have no idea what an ADM3e-br does.

The default %{status_fields} does not contain color attributes, only simple
attributes.

If the server (mud) did the hiliting, then what you want can't be done.

I haven't tried socks5, but a likely suspect is the nonblocking
connect.  Try this:  in unix/Config, make sure the SOCKS_NONBLOCK line
is commented out, and recompile.  (This will have the effect of
removing the SOCKS_NONBLOCK line from src/config.h.)

Hence my multi-part approach to disabling all colours.  Some servers
that I use have the option of colour.  As I predominantly use rxvt(1x) I
use ansi_strip so that I don't need to faff around with macros to switch
server-config.  Tinyfugue copes with this brilliantly, which is great.
Thanks Ken.

My apologies for not being more explicit.  Simple stuff works fine.  The
colour escapes are what fails.  But see below.

That's better than my version (in another follow-up).  Thanks.  Though I
use TERM=/"adm*" as it's a family of machines.

I've found a solution, which explains what seems to be a bug, still.

The problem is that there seems to be some form of caching of the values
for the status-line internals.  Unsetting the colour values AFTER the
status-line has been set appears to do nothing.  But THEN reloading the
StatusLine.tf file clears the flaws.  I hope this information helps.
I'll just re-order my .tfrc a little.

Genuine green-screen serial-into-annex terminal.  The CompSci dept here
has seriously old eq.  Sun ELCs trying to run Solaris + CDE anyone?

Ah ha, now I know what you're saying.

It's not caching, it just doesn't redraw the display when you change
the color code definitions.  The new definition will be used by the
first redraw (^L, an update to a status field value, a change to
%status_fields, etc).  I don't think that's unreasonable behavior; %TERM
and color definitions are things you should normally set very early
(before enabling visual mode) and not change again.

The next version will have a simple command to disable color, for the less
sophisticated user.

Thanks.

Oh, and I take the point re ordering of setting stuff.  My config has
been duly altered.  Thanks.

As Ken Keys hinted in another mail, he might change the current meaning of
'n' attribute.

When I echo stuff, I need to be able to add echos that preserve the
previous attributes and echos that do not.

for example, I want all channels to be blue, but I want channel "party" to
be green. I also want some of my friends to be bold.

if I do (with "party" and "naked" being evalled from variables):
/echo -a%{lite_channels},%{lite_chan_party},%{lite_name_Naked}
I end up with a bold cyan line.

on the other hand, if I first put something like:
/set lite_curlite=%lite_channels
/if (lite_chan_party !~ "") /set lite_curlite=%lite_chan_party%%; /endif
/if (lite_name_Naked !~ "") /set lite_curlite=%lite_chan_Naked%%; /endif
/echo -a%{lite_curlite}
I get ofcourse a bold line.

If I want, ofcourse I can make different variables for lites that are to be
added to previous ones and lites for variables that are not to be added,
but this is an awful lot of work. The problem becomes even bigger with
/echo -p:

I can have:
/set lite_curlite=%lite_channels
/if (lite_chan_party !~ "") /set lite_curlite=%lite_chan_party%%; /endif
/if (lite_name_Naked !~ "") /set lite_curlite=%lite_chan_Naked%%; /endif
/echo -p - @{%{lite_curlite,%lite_other}}@{%lite_yetanother}blah@{n}

If there were an attribute "N" for example that was for turning off lites
that were before, we would have solved the /echo problem, but not entirely
the /echo -p problem.

If we have:
/echo -p -aBCblue - something @{NCgreen}really@{n} weird

should the 'really' word be bold-green or just green.

So there you have it. Lots of liting to ponder on.

Hello,

I caught the problem but still do not understand why this triggered the hook
over and over again.
The hook was set to a pattern like 'prompt ^(\?+) (\?+) ([0-9]+) >'.
Then I used the first parameter and tried to calculate something with it which
is obviously impossible because it's just some "?".
Since I removed that bug to do calculations with a variable which contains "??"
the hook does not get triggered any longer.

But I still do not understand why I didnt get any error message and/or why the
hook got triggered over and over again.

Harry


>>> Message from Harry Brueckner <brueckner@respublica.de>

I use a prompt hook to calculate a few things which I like to see on my prompt.
Now for some reason the prompt seems to flicker. To examine that I set mecho=all
and found out that the hook is constantly called. I got lines over lines of
debug output showing my prompt hook called.
What can cause this? As far as I understood that hook it only gets called if a
new prompt from the MUD arrives.

Any hints are welcome.

I just changed my /require to:
/def require = /let glob=*{%{L}}*%; /if (_loaded_libs!/glob) /load %*%; /endif

and then I can /cd to my local macros directory and use /require from
there. (I had to use a variable for glob cause it wouldn't let me put %{L}
or {L} into the glob expression)

And yes, we know how violently opposed you are to "hacks" even though you
made your own "half-cooked" connections on a moo server...

Modified from /require in stdlib.tf

In personal .tfrc:
/set MYLIBDIR ~/priv/lib/Tf
or whatever

In another file (local.tf, for instance, or one that they load
explicitly in startup):
/def -i requiremy = \
        /if /test _loaded_libs !/ "*{%{1}}*"%; /then \
                /load %{MYLIBDIR}/%{1} %;\
        /endif

And we get the advantage of getting to use the standard /~loaded and
_loaded_libs, eg, in file foo.tf:
/~loaded foo.tf

Howdy folks.  

Anyone know how tf determines that a mail file is no longer new mail?
(When it takes the Mail flag off the status line)

I was thinking it might check the access time vs. the modified time,
but I can't figure it out.  Thanks.

This comment from util.c explains how it works, and some of the reasoning
behind it:

 * If the file exists and is not empty, we follow this chart:
 *
 *                 || first   | new     | mtime same   | mtime changed
 * Timestamps      || test    | file    | as last test | since last test
 * ================++=========+=========+==============+=================
 * mtime <  atime  || 0,mail  | 0       | 0            | 0      
 * mtime == atime  || 0,mail  | 1,hook% | same         | 0
 * mtime >  atime  || 0,mail  | 1,hook  | 1            | 1,hook
 *
 * "0" or "1" means turn the "(Mail)" indicator off or on; "same" means
 * leave it in the same state it was in before the check.
 * "mail" means print a message.  "hook" means call the MAIL hook.
 *
 * [%]Problem:
 * If the file is created between checks, and mtime==atime, there is
 * no way to tell if the mail has been read.  If shell() or suspend()
 * is used to read mail, we can avoid this situation by checking mail
 * before and after shell() and suspend().  There is no way to avoid
 * it if mail is read in an unrelated process (e.g, another window).
 *
 * Note that mail readers can write to the mail file, causing a change 
 * in size, a change in mtime, and mtime==atime.

IMNSHO, this would work better if we could match a newline inside a
regexp, and gag partial matches, defining a gag on a partial match to
extend to the limits of the line.  This is more in keeping with existing
syntax.
/def -P1g -mregexp -t'last-chars-on-trigger-line\\n(.*)$' foo
Or even, to take advantage of the "extend to line limits" bit, dropping
the inefficient and now redundant "*" from that pattern.

Comments?  Flames?

And yes, I know about:
/def -t'my-matching-pattern' foobar = /def -1 -mregexp -ag -t'.'
which should do it.  Untested.  Substitute -n5 for the -1 to make it gag
the next five lines.  Hey, lets be really sick and note that we can
determine the number of lines to gag based upon a number given in the
text from the MUD/whatever.

Flames :) First of all, this would be very hard to make, as tinyfugue seems
to be very line oriented. Second, partial match with a gag doesn't sound
nice. What if isn't a complete line. We would have to remove a part of the
line from the center of the line, but log and record to the history the
complete line. Thirdly, I can't see the advantage of this. I don't think
defining triggers in a trigger is too much of a expense.

-t'.' doesn't match if the line is empty. /def -1 -mglob -ag -t"*" is
better. And if you call getting the number of lines to gag from the mud
sick, go check out <http://www.sci.fi/~nakedi/steel/bat.html>.

But there are some things I would like a way of doing easier:

	Multiline matches.

Not regular expressions that span multiple lines, but some way of saying
this comes next. Eg. I have several lines:
/def -ip105 -t"Line1" starttrig = \
  /def -iFp104 -t"*" temp_cleartrig = /purge -i temp_*%; \
  /def -ip105 -n1 -t"Line2" temp_trig1 = \
    /def -ip105 -n1 -t"Line3" temp_trig2 = \
      /def -ip105 -n1 -t"Line4" temp_trig3 = \
        /def -ip105 -n1 -t"Line5" temp_trig4 = \
          /do_the_thing_we_wanna_do_when_we_find_the_lines
This isn't nice. (And pseudocode, dunno if this will work.)

	Changing attributes regarding to content in a trigger

Eg. I want to gag all lines in a party where the hp and sp are at max, so
pseudocode:
/def -iFp50 -mregexp -t"blah ([0-9]+)/([0-9]+) blah blah" trigu = \
  /if ({P1} >= {P2}) \
    /def -iFp49 -ag -n1 -t"*" gagt

	Changing statusline colors regarding to the content of the values

We can possibly (haven't tested) make some hack with changing the
status_fields variable every time a value is changed, but I do not like the
solution. I want my hp to be red when they are below 100.

	Bug

I am not sure, but I think there's a bug in the statusline code if you have
a status_line with no variable width fields and it doesn't span the whole
lines. Eg. the first time it is drawn from the left and when values are
changed, they are changed in the places that would be if the statusline was
in the right edge. I can't use variable width fields in my statusline,
because it is alternating rCgreen and rCcyan attributes and plain '_' in
the middle would not look good.

----------

Oh poopie, this has been an all around rampage of many different things,
maybe I better change the subject and just hope Ken has the stamina to read
thru this all :P

TIA,

The command

  /def -p2147483647 -n5 -ag -t"*" gaglines

unconditionally gags the next 5 lines.  The high priority makes it override
any other triggers (including hilites) that might match those lines.

"Partial gags" might be doable, but don't hold your breath.

Multi-line matches are not possible as such.  Consider this:

  /def -ag -mregexp -t'foo\\nbar'

Then, when a line matching "foo" is received, TF would have to wait for
the next line to see if it matched "bar".  TF wouldn't be able to do anything
else during this wait, not even read normal keyboard input.  No, a series
of separate matches is the only way to do this, as Nuutti illustrated:

There should probably be purge commands at each step, in case any step
is missed.  I agree that all the nesting and handling of missed cases
is ugly, and I've been meaning to create a more convenient way to do
this for some time.  I have an incomplete version that may make it into
the next release; using it, the example above would look something like
this:

/def -ip105 -t"Line1" starttrig = /step2
/test expect("step2", "Line2", "step3")
/test expect("step3", "Line3", "step4")
/test expect("step4", "Line4", "step5")
/test expect("step5", "Line5", "do_the_thing_we_wanna_do")

The expect() arguments are a name and any number of pattern/command
pairs.  The mutiple pattern/command pairs allows branching and looping
in the "script".  I still have some features to work out, like a
simple/glob/regexp option and a fallthru/non-fallthru option.

In the next release, you will be able to use /substitute to set attributes
on the triggering line.

It's on my list.

Noted.  Expect a fix in the next release.

In the next release, /load will will read from any directory listed in
%TFPATH.  I am considering ways to make /require work for any directory
or file.

Hi Guys ...
First i have to say that i like TF more and more i learn to use it.
But it seems i have to learn a lot more :)

I have a wonderful spell named detect agressive,
but the output does really spam my screen :(

in Brief mode ...

Hi,

     I'm currently developing a small project that uses 8-bit characters
(actually, the Line Drawing chars).  Its on a MUSE that I am making on my
system.  Origionally, I used to telnet into WindsMARE (another MUD) so I
could talk to people while I coded, and then log into my MUSE to work.
Whenever I ddit his, the 8-bit ldraw chars showed up just like they were
supposed to.

	Winds, however, is going down for the summer.  So, I go to log
on to my MUSE w/o logging into WindsMARE first, and find that my 8-bit
characters are no longer line-draw characters, but some other high-font
jazz.  I cannot seem to figure out how to make it use the other set of
8-bit characters....can anyone help me here?

            Thanks.

I've recently installed TinyFugue 4.0a7.  Wonderful upgrade!

My problem:

When on a MUCK, I sometimes type the MUSH command '+who' by accident.  I'd
like for TF to catch that command and output 'wd' for me automatically. 
However, I only want it to do this for those worlds that I have defined as
'tiny.muck'.  For all other types of worlds, I want to use +who as I would
normally. 

I've looked though the documentation, and briefly tried something with
/def and /bind.

The closest I was able to come to was:

% 324: /def -p1 -mglob -T'tiny.muck' -t'*+who*' pluswho = wd

It only will do a 'wd' if it sees a '+who' on any world of type
'tiny.muck', which isn't what I'm hoping for, of course. 

Can anyone steer me in the right direction?  Thanks.

Pretty close, /help hooks would have put you right

/def -p1 -mglob -T'tiny.muck' -h'SEND +who' pluswho = wd

should work.

This doesn't work if you call send() or /send directly, or if you use some
kind of a command separator like 'look;+who', but works often enough still.

it has been counted a certain number of times, execute an command.

This works, but I have to think there is a better way:

/def -h'send {+who}' pluswho = \
   /if (${world_type} =~ "tiny.muck") wd%; \
      /else /send +who%; \
   /endif

Use '/send +who' in the /else instead of just '+who' to avoid recursion.

  uidle(s) (int) Number of seconds since last user input to a world <s>,

  cidle(s) (int) Number of seconds since last input to a world
                   (user+trigger input), same thing with <s>


As it is now I have to log into the mud as a guest and finger myself to
see how long I have been idle, there are lots of other uses too, you'll
figure them out.

the logic behind the suggested names is very vague, I thought of
user-idle and client-idle

thanks in advance,

Q:

I use a Unix machine with several IP's. One default IP is used for
outgoing network-connections. Several IRC clients (such as BitchX) have
the option of choosing an IP, instead of using the default IP. With
"bitchx -H steen.heremiet.nl", I appear on IRC as walter@steen.heremiet.nl;
otherwise I would show up as walter@love.drugs.and.the.1nter.net, which is
my default IP. (steen.heremiet.nl is another name assigned to the same
box. I am not root, so won't be able to add/remove network routes.)

I do not know if there is an option in TF for doing this, and I am not
experienced in socket/network coding in C myself, so I hope someone can
help me with this!

Tnx!
Walter

Hey all, 
I have a pretty simple problem I think. I like to have it beep when someone
connects and disconnects. I have a simple trigger that works for most people.
But I have one friend it sometimes works for, and sometimes doesn't.
Especially when she disconnects. I have a seperate trigger just for her
disconnects. 

This is what I have now:
/trig ChocolateChip has disconnected.=/beep

I have another trigger that is:
/trig ChocolateChip has disconnected=@pemit me=Disconnect at [time()]. 
This one always works. 

Could it be that she's disconnecting via closing the window rather then by
useing QUIT and then /quit? Would that make a diffrence? 

Any help you can give would be appreciated!

Thanks,
Marlene

If you have both of these at the same time, you should check whether
they're fall-through (-F flag) or not, or check priorities, and then try
to set them up with a regular /def instead of /trig :)

Mad.

1) The first trigger has a period, the second doesn't ...
2) If you use /trig, I think it assigns the same priority to the
   macro, so tf will find the matching macro of the highest (here,
   same) priority, then pick a random one of those to execute, so you
   might sometimes get one, sometimes the other.
3) I'd recommend naming your macros as well; expand those out to
   /def -t'etc' name_here = etc
   This way you can also specify the priorities that you want.

Thanks to everyone who took the time to answer my question about triggers.
Adding a -F to the triggers worked perfectly. 

(I did change them to /def -t BTW)

Thanks again,
Marlene

If you just type /quit you go linkdead but do NOT quit the MUD I think. At least
that is what happens on my MUD. Then, after 45 minutes these linkdead players
are kicked out of the game.
If you use "quit" and then "/quit" you leave the MUD regularly.

How on earth would you get those weirdo IBM-charset linedrawing charcters
in the first place? On the ISO 8859-1 (or -2 or other variants) font you
have the high characters be the national characters. And ISO 8859-1 is
probably the most common font around... That IBM font (cp850 ?) is basically
just found on ancient DOS machines, since it's the default in VGA.

Easy. Many windows clients allow you to select the SYSTEM_OEM_FONT (or
whatever it is) instead of the default.

Actually, I found out how to do it.  First of all, I'm using a Linux Box
(and many windows terminal fonts have the line-draw characters built into
them, well most good terminal fonts.  And I never have a problem when
using a windows terminal).  However, I found out from Byron Stanozek
(Maintainer of WindsMARE) that a special ANSI sequence will put a Linux
terminal into a special 'Raw character mode' which replaces the
international characters with the Line-Draw characers. (The sequence is
'ESC(K')
But thanks anyways,

What I wanted was for it to trigger, wait 10 seconds and check to see if
I'm still idle.  If so, send afk, thus triggering it again.  I've been
poking at it for an hour and I'm not sure what is wrong.  I've done
plenty of similar things, but most of them were of the /if /repeat
/endif variety.  I'm sure someone can point out a silly flaw.  I thank

The %; is being interpreted as the end of the '/repeat ...' clause. You
want to delay the %; from being eval'd until after the timer runs out.
Also, the stuff in $[] was executing now (it got eval'd as well).  If the
$[] was necessary, you'd escape it with a $$, but text inside the /if ()
parentheses are already interpreted as an expression, so omit the $[]
entirely.


/def -w'sam' -mregexp -t'You have become AFK.$' autoafk =\
   /repeat -10 1 \
     /if (idle() >= 10) /send -w'sam' afk %%; /endif

Why does the following work:

/recall -g /10 ^\[ \(QUEST\).*Richard

But the following trigger gives me an unmatched [] error?

/def -t'([^ ]+) tells you, \'questhistory (.*)\'' questhistory =
    /quote tell %P1 # -g /10 ^\[ \(QUEST\).*%P2

If I take out the "^\[ " part in the beginning, it works OK, but of course, if
someone triggers the same person twice, it also quotes back any previous tells,
because they now contain the matching text which looks something like this:

[ (QUEST) Talemon assigned to Richard ]
[ (QUEST) Richard completed his quest ]

Ron

PS: My default matching is regexp.

Because the \ is interpreted by the macro body expansion of /questhistory,
so the actual /quote command is

  /quote tell <name> # -g /10 ^[ (QUEST).*<string>

You need to use two \'s to escape that:

  /def -t'([^ ]+) tells you, \'questhistory (.*)\'' questhistory =
      /quote tell %P1 # -g /10 ^\\[ \\(QUEST\\).*%P2

Hi, I'm having a problem where my addworlds are being logged into, 
despite the setting of login. (I've gone as far as to change the variable 
default in varlist.h) It only exhibits this behaviour when my world file 
is sourced automatically at startup. When I source it manually with /load 
(not in .tfrc), the autologin is suppressed. I've used both version 
4alpha4 and 7, and I've used the -l command line switch, to no effect.

I'm sorry if this is answered elsewhere, but I'm at my wits end *sigh* 
Oh, the system this is compiled on is Solaris 2.5 (SunOS 5.5 ?).

Thanks for any help,
jeff

I believe you mean tf -n

if you truly want to connect to a mud at startup, but not login, eg.
letting you type name & pass, just leave the name & pass out of the file.

You need a trigger on room entry that sets some counter variables to 0 and
defines the "dangerous" triggers and an end trigger.

The "dangerous" triggers gag the line, and increment the corresponding
counter.

The end trigger undefines itself and the "dangerous" triggers, and echos
the counters.

The tricky part is how to define the end trigger pattern.  If your mud
has OUTPUTSUFFIX, you can use that.  Otherwise, you can execute some
command with known output in the start trigger, and have the end
trigger match (and gag) that output.

Why distinguish the two kinds of idle?  uidle() is more complicated
than cidle(), so I'm not going to implement uidle() unless there's a
good reason.

Its been a year now at least since TF was made for NT.  Is there any new
versions of
TF for NT besides the one I got from december ?

Ah, I thought I forgot to answer that message. Well Ken has done quite
well for it.

The ending part can be done such too that the "dangerous" triggers are for
example priority 1 and not fall-thru and a general "*" trigger is fallthru
that actually triggers the aggressive display.

And (in my mud atleast) triggering room entry is very tricky, so we can
have the triggers on all the time and just clear the variables every time
we display the aggressive line.

so, some quickly written example triggers:

/def -iag -p1 -msimple -t"You sense someone dangerous under you!" \
	d_ut = /test ++d_u%;/edit -ic100 d_trig
/def -iag -p1 -msimple -t"You sense someone dangerous above you!" \
	d_dt = /test ++d_d%;/edit -ic100 d_trig
/def -iag -p1 -msimple -t"You sense someone dangerous to the west!" \
	d_wt = /test ++d_w%;/edit -ic100 d_trig
/def -iF -c0 -mglob -t"*" d_trig = \
	/eval /echo - Aggressive: D%d_dt, U%d_ut, W%d_wt, ...%; \
	/set d_ut=0%; /set d_dt=0%; /set d_wt=0%; \
	/edit -ic0 d_trig

Hope those work and you get the idea.

Here is something i'd like to do on the mud:

If I type "gold" I get this result:

You have 900 coins on hand.
You have 900000 coins in the bank.
You have 900900 coins total.

I would like such display to trigger a auto-deposit of the amount I have
on hand.

Kinda like this:

/trig *You have ??? coins on hand. = deposit XXX

What do I put in place of ??? so it takes the value of what the mud sends
and uses it?

I wish to also use it to recognize mobs attacking me and such.

I would appreciate a few example of commands/triggers you've created that
take a word from what the mud/mush sends and can recognize it and use it.

Other example:

Mr.Bean is wounded and will possibly die. (this is sent by the mud)

/trig ??? is wounded and will possibly die. = cast 'heal' ???

Thanks in advance. I hope you get my idea :)

/trig is fairly primitive and not advisable for most things.
Use /def instead.  /help def should fill you in on all the info you need,
and includes some examples just like the ones you gave above.

e.g.
/def -mglob -t'You have {*} coins on hand.' trig_deposit=\
  deposit %3

(/help %1 will list the selection variables you can use.)

On the mud I typically play, recent modifications have broken a few macros
I have set up and i am wondering if you can give me some advice how to fix
them.

the macros were very simple : they were simple for loops to open a series
of chests at the same time.

now I need to put a 10 second delay between each iteration of the for
loop. What is happening is  on the first iteration of the loop the first
command is issued. Then on the second iteration the second command is
issued and so on. But when the second command is issued, the first
comkmand is not done yet and gets interrupted by the second command.

so my question is how do I put the necessary delay in the loop?

/help keybindings

/def -BUP, /def -BLEFT, /def -BRIGHT, /def -BDOWN

if your termcap is broken or you are using some hardcoded termcap, the
arrow keys might not be what you want, try using

/def -b"^[[A", /def -b"^[[B", ...

You can see the keycode what the arrow key produces by typing ^V and the
char, or whatever is your quote-ch.

I would say that using arrow keys to move around rather than modify input
line is a bad idea. Ofcourse, if you are fluent in using the ^P, ^N, ^F,
^B keys for editing, it might not be a problem. Also you can't get
diagonals anywhere.

If you mud from a constant terminal, you might try binding the keypad
entries better.

Check out /help repeat

You probably have the loop made up this style (pseudocode):
(/openchests sends something like "turn chest 1 to %i;turn chest 2 to
%i;turn chest 3 to %i;...)

for(i=0;i<100;i++) {
	/openchests %i
}

Now you have a couple choices. Either make the thing recursive:

/def open_em = 
	/openchests %i
	/test ++i
	/if(i<100) {
		/repeat -10 1 /open_em
	}

Or just write up a plain repeat for the number you want

/def open_em =
	/set i=0
	/repeat -10 100 /test openchests(++i)

the latter is cleaner and nicer, but not necessarily what you need.

Hope this helps,

 Hiyas

 I'm looking for a way to randomly read a single line from a file. Even
reading a specific line would be enuff, I could probably make the
randomizer myself, but I just can't seem to get things working with the
reading. Please give me some advice in this, I seem to be stuck.

/def random_file_line = \
    /let selection=%;\
    /let lines=0%;\
    /quote -S /random_line_ '%*%;\
    /echo %{selection}

/def random_line_ = \
    /test rand(++lines) | (selection:={*})


Then do something like:

/quote :> `/random_file_line filename

or you can use $(/random_file_line filename) to capture the line via
other means, etc.

of 1.2M, while a C-program did it in 0.5s. Maybe the trigger can be
optimized though. I faced the same problem as Patrik 2 years ago and wrote
this ugly ugly thing:

/def -t'* tells you *' autotell = /quote reply !rline tells.txt

to utilize it.
The results from the tells.txt experiment can be found on the same site,
unfortunately amusing only if you know finnish.

The uses of uidle() are more limited surely but I had thought of triggers
that start working/reacting only when I'm truly idle. idle() could handle
this but then I can't be in another world or touch window at all, not a
great loss but would make the client a little more perfect.

Hi, I'm learning how to use tf and here's my questions:

1. Scope probelm. I'd like to know how to control the scope of the 
commands. e.g.
   when I do /repeat -20 3 command1 %; command2
it'll do command1 and command2 every 20 seconds for 3 times. what if I 
want to repeat the command1 only for 3 times and do command2 once?
don't tell me I can do it separately. this will lead to the next 
question.

2. how to send 2 or more commands in one command line. just like in 
tintin++, we can do that by command1;command2;command3;...

TIA.

you can do it separately, but you can also try:
/repeat -20 1 command1%; /repeat -20 2 command1%; command2 
although that might be the same as doing it separately... oh well yeah the
next question will help better.

>2. how to send 2 or more commands in one command line. just like in

this one's easier, just /set sub on. Then you can do
command1%;command2%;command3%;...
which will also let your previous statement work all right.

Within a macro body, %; separates commands, and %% is replaced with %.
So to get a separator into a deeper scope, use %%; (see /help expansion,
substitution).  Substitution is by default NOT done on the command line;
you can use /eval to force it, or /set sub=on to make it default.

So, in a macro body, or with /eval, or with sub=on, that will do exactly
what you want; and if you wanted both commands repeated, you'd use %%;

Macro body, /eval, or sub=on, and use %;.

Hi, here's another 2 questions:

1. why don't use simple separator(e.g. ;) but more complicated "%;"?

2. in logging and triggers, etc. the output we captured is not the 
original output. it seems suppress the color things, etc. even the 
spaces ahead of a line. I knew that /set emulation=debug will print the 
escape things out but that's not what i want. what i want is like:

capture something(with color, space ahead) and print myself use /echo or 
something like that.  

Hope you guys understand me :)

I need to kill a /repeat command with the use of a trigger.
The problem is that the pid of the /repeat changes every time I start
it.

And I can't kill a process by it's name (I haven't figured out how
anyway).

/def -PCred -mregexp -F -t'(.*) died.' tSpecialDeath =               

This is how the trigger looks like, but what shall I put behind the '='

The return value of /repeat is the pid of the process.  So, store that
in a variable, and use it with /kill later.

  /repeat ...%; /set my_pid=%?

  /def -PCred -mregexp -F -t'(.*) died.' tSpecialDeath = /kill %my_pid

I recently discovered, after much confusion and poking, that
TF rewrites your .tfrc file without being asked.  What's going
on here??

I discovered it because I was editing the .tfrc while running
the program and it kept erasing my changes!

Why does it get rewritten like this??

I think you should start with checking your own marcos, cause I
am very sure that this is not the default behaviour!

Hi all! I need a macro to erase the attributes off of an object. The
attributes are in this format:

MON_MAY__2_10_24_32_1998
or
MON MAY_23_12_43_57_1998

Obviously it's a date. I want soemthing to look at an object and take off all
attributes fitting this format.  

I have an answering maching on a MUSH, and I need to be able to erase it
every so often without taking the time to sit there and type in 200 diffrent
attributes... 

So this is the command that needs to get sent to the MUSH: 
&mon_may__2_10_24_32_1998 #7763= 

Please help me with this, I'm going nuts! 

Thanks,
Marlene

It looks like you need to (as a part of this macro):
1. define the trigger.
   It should trigger on a line of 'property' text that you see, that matches
   the format you want to remove.  The body of the trigger should send the
   'undefine' command in the format you have specified above, using the
   property that matched.
2. send the command to examine yourself (on mucks it would be "ex me=/**"; I
   don't know about mushes
3. undefine the trigger.

I can't be any more detailed than this, as I don't know what the output format
of your 'examine' function looks like.

I'm really embarrassed now... Thanks for everyones help. A few people pointed
out @wipe, and this would work too... 

Thanks again, and I'm sorry I wasted y'alls time with such a stupid question!

 The text "Most Pitiful Enemy
Slain" appears in yellow this should be in grey, but sometimes it comes
out in yellow now I know its tinyfugue and this kind of annoying problem

has been in the software since I started using it which has to be over 2

years ago or close to it. Please someone experiment with the file and
hopfuly someone can fix the problem. Just in case the attement doesn't
work I put it in the message as well.

hm, good idea, but wouldn't
/test var & dothis(...)
do that as well?
for anything more complicated, it would be best to stick with /if.

Yes, I can see %& and %| helping greatly with obfuscation.

I really don't know if this would simplify the /if-sentences or not, so I
will take
your word on it.
I find the current way very simple, and have other things I would like to
learn
instead of a new /if structure. So if Mr. Keys takes this suggestion
seriously,
I would hope that he would leave the old /If structure in for those of us
who
have taken the time to learn to do it his way :) .

Data added to a world stream by /echo -w seems to be disappearing
when I /recall info from that world.

Is this correct behaviour?  I know it didn't used to behave like
this...

I'm using 4.0 alpha 7, BTW, patched up from alpha 6.

PS
I'm not exactly sure, but looking at the changelog I'd hazard a
guess this happened when the builtin /echo was replaced with the
function?

Mitja's point was valid. As we are allowed to have this feature in
expressions, I would like to see it in substitutions also.

As for obfuscation, this is already in expressions and in most programming
languages known to man. And ofcourse the /if is here to stay too, this is
just for simplifying things.

Yet, there is one problem: the %| operator signifies a 'pipe' operation
already, so we'll have to remedy that somehow.

I would like to see this implemented in tf.

I looked around, but I couldn't quite find anything like this within the
documentation.

If I could wave a magic wand, any time I did a 'resize' of my TinyFugue
screen within XTerm, TinyFugue would send something like this:

@set me=_prefs/screenwidth:<some new column int>

Even if I had to manually use a macro command, it would be VERY handy to
report to the MUCK server whatever my screenwidth happens to be in XTerm
at the moment.  I can see how to '/quote' to the server what version of
TinyFugue I'm using, I can _SET_ the wrapsize, but I can't access wrapsize
from a /quote, it seems.  Any ideas?

you can use a resize hook: %1 is the columns, %2 is the lines:

/def -hRESIZE resizehook = @set me=_prefs/screenwidth:%1

rather than using that, just put %{wrapsize} in your macro and it will sub
it...

/def saysize = say my wrapsize is %{wrapsize}.

Hello, I need some minor help.  I have a whole bunch of triggers set up
from long ago that still work but sometimes I get these warning messages. 
For instance, in one trigger: 

/def -p1 -mglob -t'* ceases to move.. still and lifeless.' ceased = /let
NAME=%{-L6}%;gsay $[toupper(%NAME)] is Paralyzed!%;snicker

(by the way, is there a better way to do this?)

I get this warning message (sometimes):

% ceased: warning: %... substitution in expression can be confusing.  Try
using {...} instead.

Does this mean that I should replace * with {*} ??  I've tried changing a
lot of things around in the trigger itself but still get that warning
message. 

Also, I've changed some triggers to this format ( I saw someone in the
listserver recommending triggers of this form )  but now they don't work.
Am I to assume that the brackets {} means that a space appears before and
after the wildcard? 

i.e.  is this:

/def -p1 -mglob -t'You are*hungry.' eat = \
    get %{FOOD-ration} %{BAG-holding}%; \
    eat %{FOOD-ration}%; \
    drop partial

the same as

/def -p1 -mglob -t'You are{*}hungry.' eat = etc...

or should it be this

/def -p1 -mglob -t'You are {*} hungry.' eat = etc...

or is there a difference?  

The line to set off the trigger could be either:  
You are hungry.
or
You are getting hungry.

I just wanted to create one trigger that would work for both.

NOTE: FOOD and BAG are set from a file I load at startup connection to the
world, different for different characters.

Question 2:
I want to create a macro that will drag X number of items (of the same type) 
from one room to the next.
i.e. if I want to drag 3 barrels north, I type in:
  drag barrel drag 2.barrel drag 3.barrel n

I created a macro but it doesn't seem to work. Can anyone give me some
advice on how to fix it?  Here is the macro:  

/def drag = /let DIR=%{3}%;/let ITM=%{2}%;/let CNT=%{1}%;/let
INDEX=1%;/while (INDEX <= CNT) /let DRAG=%{DRAG} drag
%{INDEX}.%{ITM}%;/let INDEX=$[INDEX+1]%;/done%;/setn - %{DRAG} %{DIR} 

I would type:  /drag 3 barrel n

Thanks for your help.

	I've had the same thing happen with older trigs of mine as well
after upgrading TF versions; the fix 
	is a simple matter of replacing all the %BLAH references with
{BLAH} throughout. 

	I.e. the above trig becomes:

	/def -p1 -mglob -t'* ceases to move.. still and lifeless.'
ceased = /let
	NAME=%{-L6}%;gsay $[toupper({NAME})] is Paralyzed!%;snicker

	Kind of a pain, but it does eliminate some syntactic candy,
which is nice.

I posted this message last week, wondering if anyone else get this
same problem ?

 The text "Most Pitiful Enemy
Slain" appears in yellow this should be in grey, but sometimes it comes
out in yellow now I know its tinyfugue and this kind of annoying problem

has been in the software since I started using it which has to be over 2

years ago or close to it. Please someone experiment with the file and
hopfuly someone can fix the problem. Just in case the attement doesn't
work I put it in the message as well.

this is'n a question for help, just wondered if anyone out there has ever
tried to have tinyfugue use ansi music in it's aliases triggers, etc. I
was thinking it might be kind of cool and it's a way of communicating
without sending text.

Hi folks,

The server i run tf from is the bristol comp soc server. There are about
10 people who now use tf on the server and its taking up huge ammounts of
processor time. Our sys admin isn't awfully happy about this and is
considering banning its use.

Has anyone set up or thought about setting up a server demon version of
tf, i.e. one that multiple users can use the same process of?

Cheers

Rowan

Thanks for the help. By the way, does anyone know of perhaps a web page
with the tf commands in a more simpleton language such as this?  The
technical help references are great but can be tough to decipher.

drag barrel drag 2.barrel drag 3.barrel n 
>Umm...
>wouldn't the mud respond better to:
>drag barrel n
>drag barrel n
>drag barrel n
>Or does it allow: drag barrel 2.barrel 3.barrel n?
no, this will not work.

the actual syntax for dragging multiple items on the mud is:

drag <item> drag <item> ... drag <item> <direction>

I could "drag barrel n" but then I'd have to return for each additional
barrel.  In the case of more than 1 item of the same name, you can type
drag 3.barrel n
which will drag the third barrel in the room to the north.

So to reiterate my question here (I seem to have deleted it :D )

I want to drag multiple items into the next room and am trying to create a
macro to do this. Here is what I have (in somewhat easier to understand
format):

/def drag = \
  /let DIR=%{3}%; \
  /let ITM=%{2}%; \
  /let CNT=%{1}%; \
  /let INDEX=1%;  \
  /while (INDEX <= CNT)  \
     /let DRAG=%{DRAG} drag%{INDEX}.%{ITM}%; \
     /let INDEX=$[INDEX+1]%; \
  /done%; \
  /send %{DRAG} %{DIR}

I dont use any color triggers or any of that stuff.  I just wish someone that
knows TF can fix the
problem, I give all the data that is needed to do the testing.  Me my self
think it has something
to do with the stupid prompt crap thats in TF which is not needed for the mud
I play on.

Oh you wanted to know the mud its 3k.org 5000

Has anyone coded an array package?  I'm trying to implement some
macros that require arrays (preferably dynamic, but I could deal with
static as well) & it doesn't appear that there are builtin array types.

I could of course implement them using strings with delimiters, but
I'm trying to minimize work here :-)

What methods have you folks used in the past to handle problems
that require arrays?

It's a workaround, but you can always try to 'nice' tf.

See 'man nice' for more info.

Are these people all running the same executable, or their own private copies?
It would likely be more efficient to all run TF from the same location.

Also make sure you're running the latest version (4.0a7 currently), as the
older ones might have had memory leaks or other problems which show up after
a long period of time.

TF by itself is not a heavy CPU user, but it is possible for users to
write inefficient triggers, hooks, and macros that will make TF use a
lot of CPU.  One common mistake is using ".*" or "^.*" at the beginning
of a regexp; it is very inefficient, and not necessary.  I can only
suggest having all the users clean up their macros to reduce CPU usage
or risk the wrath of your sysadmin.

That doesn't make sense.  You can set up a public copy of tf on disk for
multiple users to save disk space, but it will have little effect on CPU
usage.

It can also reduce memory footprint due to shared code pages, and if
the machine is swapping, this could help significantly - even though
the TF binary is quite small..

I think this was already covered on this list, but /echo -w (with no world
name) is broken in 40a5 - 40a7.  The following replacement can be used
until the next release.

;;; /echo [-a<attr>] [-p] [-oer] [-w[<world>]] <text>
/def -i echo = \
    /let opt_a=%; \

I have written some commands to handle arrays following the suggestions
of Ken and others on this list. You can find the package on
http://www.ph-cip.uni-koeln.de/~dittmar/tf
I hope it helps ...

Hi Ken (& everyone),

I was looking over the status bar code, and got to the point of
wanting to be able to easily change the attributes on a particular
field.  I came up with a mod that goes like this:

If the attribute field starts with a %, treat it as a variable
containing the attributes for the field, else treat it as previously.

It allows something like:

/set content_attrs=Cred
/set contents=Whatever
/set status_fields=@more:8 :1 contents:7:%content_attrs :1 ......

And for the attributes of the field to be automagically updated by
just setting the content_attrs field to something else.

It's not as flexible as it could be, nor as efficent - it reevaluates
the attribute variable each time it's needed, rather than just when it
is changed. However, I thought I'd throw it out to you and the mailing
list for comment.

The actual diff file is available at:

ftp://pc24.sr.bham.ac.uk/pub/packages/SOURCES/tf-40a7.status.patch

and for those with RPM based systems, a source RPM, and an i386 binary
RPM are also available (though they also have a patch to increase
history sizes included):

ftp://pc24.sr.bham.ac.uk/pub/packages/SRPMS/tf-40a7-2.src.rpm
ftp://pc24.sr.bham.ac.uk/pub/packages/RPMS/i386/tf-40a7-2.i386.rpm

Cheers,

Mark

I can see a use for using variables in the status bar attributes, but why
patch the source to increase history sizes when you can simply /histsize
whatever?

yeah, assuming you have a recent version of tf (get 4.0a7 if you don't),
you can set the status bar to have whatever attributes you want. /help
status will tell you all about it.

ok, this gets tricky, but you just need to separate them with %;, for
example
/def -t'main trigger' maintrigger = /def -t'...' trigger1 = blah%; /def
-t'...' trigger2 = blah blah...

If the other triggers do more than one command, you need to separate those
with %%;s.

'cause I'm a source code junkie, and wasn't aware of the /histsize
thing. I should RTFM more often.

ok, but what if the one of the triggers that was defined by the
main trigger, has an /endif as its last command. I can't get it to work,
it does not 'see' the /endif
eg,

/def -mglob -t'Foo' main_trigger=\
  /if (blah) /echo xxx%%; say hello%%; /endif%; \
  /def -mglob -t'Bar' trigger1=say hello you%; \
  /def -mglob -t'Baaaar' trigger2=giggle

Um,
/def -mglob -t'Foo' main_trigger=\
  /if (blah) /echo xxx%; say hello%; /endif%; \
  /def -mglob -t'Bar' trigger1=say hello you%; \ 
  /def -mglob -t'Baaaar' trigger2=giggle

it would not need the /endif if we used %%; to distinguish the parts

 Hmm.. Strange. I thought it was possible already in the current normal
code. But maybe I'm hallucinating when it works for me :)

My status bar goes like this..

/def -ag -h'SEND {statusset}' statusset = /set \
 status_fields=st_hpcur:4:%{hpattr} "/":1 st_hpmax:5:Cblue :1 \
 unsup:3:BCgreen :1 iwup:2:BCblue :1 unpup:2:BCyellow :1 \

 hwup:3:B st_eqon:4:BCred @more:1:BrCred @log:3 @mail:3:BCred \
 insert:3:Cred @clock:5

..and I have a code later on in the prompt trigger which changes the
%{hpattr} according to how much is left from hpmax. Only this turned out
to be very slow and therefore I don't use it anymore. But it should work
though.
 (Of course I may be wrong but I think I remember it working, at least
once :))

The shell 'zsh' is pretty common. Ken will probably have a chance to test
it if he isn't using it already.

zsh has a neat feature to put some things at the right edge of the prompt,
eg. path for example:

naked@vorlon$ echo pla                                /usr/local/games/bin

if the text typed by the user reaches the path, it will remove it
temporarily.

Needless to say, this would be a cool feature to tinyfugue prompts also.

TF's status bar is a more sensible place to put that kind of information;
zsh just doesn't have one.

This only works (or at least I could only get it to work) when you set
status_fields again (and this updates the entire bar). The patch
makes the attribute field work in a similar fashion to the variable
field - the field attributes are updated automatically when the
variable is changed.

Ok give me 4 status bars then :) I don't even have any delimiters between
fields, but I use different colors to separate them. Also my prompt is
nearly 70 characters... I just thought that if I could put most of the
prompt to the right edge of the screen, it would be easier for me to type.

Sorry about this mail, I seem to be on a bit whiny mood :) Your mudclient
rocks.

 Ah, indeed, that is the case. I forgot I also had the prompt run
/statusset (which updates status_fields), and that's why it was so slow in
the first place :)

  Hi all! 

  I'm using TF with a common csh and, obviusly, I don't get any colors
(just black bold). My request is that you recommend me a shell that
enables color as I'v ever seen in screenshots out there. Thanks.

Yes, the ability to do mulitple status bars would be nice.

I myself use bash, very nice powerful shell with full colour. Its not
avalible on some servers so tcsh is also an ok shell.

Hi, to my understanding its not the shell that gives you colors, but your
terminal emulation. If you're using an xterm it might not support color,
and might need another xterm (such as color-xterm, or nxterm), or some
other terminal that would allow color.

If you are using telnet, then make sure your telnet client emulates either

ansi color or VT100 color. (and of course make sure that the TERM
environmental variable is set to reflect this).

I have posted this problem but figure people are not getting my
message.  This bug has existed in the software both on NT and
on UNIX machines.  I would like to know how it can be fixed.
I call it color bleeding because colors from one part of text color
another part of text on the same line this is random which makes
it hard to test.  But it happens all the time.  I have never seen
ken keys acknowledge there is a bug, so he must not even
know about it or cant find it, just use the test file below.

 The text "Most Pitiful Enemy Slain" appears in yellow this should be in

grey, but sometimes it comes out in yellow now I know its tinyfugue
and this kind of annoying problem

has been in the software since I started using it which has to be over 2

years ago or close to it. Please someone experiment with the file and
hopfuly someone can fix the problem. Just in case the attement doesn't
work I put it in the message as well.

I can say that I've seen you post about this problem about 3 times. 

Maybe you would like to post what hilighting triggers you have so that we 
have more information to go on?

Is this a color sent back from the MU* server? Or trigger that you have
defined.

Well, those escape codes, which I presume are being sent by the server, look
okay and should reset the colors for the next lines. Certainly check that
you've not got any hilighting triggers that might match such a pattern.

ok, now got colour on the status bar, but would like the colour to be
different depending on the value of the variable
eg

if x=1 then colour of the value of x is in red
if x=2 then colour of the value of x is in green

is this possible???

This was the reason I put my patch together for 4.0a7...Anyway, with
stock 40a7, you have to change the attributes in the status_fields
variable.

Try to get lpmud prompting disabled altogether, define the world as type
lpp not lp and make sure lp is not set.

If the bug still occurs, then one must conclude that tf has the same bug
as tintin that it does not parse color codes split in multiple blocks.

He is indeed right. The shell has nothing to do with color. As for clients
that support color, you should really use a newer xterm (xterm-76) or
rxvt, if you don't need the fancy features xterm supports (window moving
with commands, menus, Tek-graphics, translations of keybinds, activeicon
etc.).

But getting a client that supports color is not enough. You also need a
termcap/terminfo entry that says "this term supports color". I have not
found one system that would not have a broken termcap somehow. xterm
should support color, screen too, xterm termcap's have often wrong values
in line end etc binds, not to even discuss function keys. You should 
probably just experiment and try to get things working.

  Hi again.

  As Andre' Miller pointed it's not a problem with the shell but with the
terminal emulation I use.

  I'm using a xterm but I cannot get any colors, neither changing the
shell to 'tcsh'. So, again, I'd like that you recommend me a terminal or a
place to download it. Thanks.

Thanks Ken, BTW.

I have made the clock on my status line display seconds as well as the hour and
minute. However it's only updated every minute at 0 seconds past the minute. Not
finding an obvious solution using /help, library files, or without using a
/repeat macro, I tried messing with output.c, but to no avail :(

Can somebody please post how to make this work?

Correct, the shell is irrelevant.  Only the terminal emulator matters.
Termcap/terminfo is also irrelevant, for color.  Very few termcap/terminfo
libraries support color, so tf ignores them and uses the start_color_*
and end_color variables, which by default contain ANSI color codes.
So, to get working wolor, you need an emulator that understands ANSI
color codes, or (less likely) you need to change the color variables to
codes that your emulator understands.  See /help color.

The internal clock status updates on the minute, and can not be changed.
But you can use a variable, which you set every second:

/repeat -1 2147483647 /set myclock=$[ftime("%I:%M:%S", time())]

And replace the "@clock:5" with "myclock:8" in %status_fields.

/Repeats execute with 0.1s precision, so your clock will never be off
by more than that, compared to the system clock.  (Actually, since you
are probably not using a realtime OS, nothing is guaranteed; but on a
system that isn't too heavily loaded, the previous statement holds.)

This is all very well but as soon as I receive new e-mail, the (Mail) indicator
disappears within a second :(

What does "random, but all the time" mean?  Unpredictably, but frequently?

How did you log this?

When you see the problem, do you have lp=on (did you define the world
as type "lp")?  If so, do you ever see part of the text appear briefly
as a prompt?

What terminal emulator do you use?  A lot of emulators have "bleeding"
bugs.

It happens just more than just that guild score, it happens on almost anything
that has color in it
just its random not something I can recreate.

Just on a side note: anyone evernotice as that sometimes the prompt
get garbage in it then it clears up a second later. I get that as well.
I am telling you there is a bug in this software and it has existed since
well since I started using TF which had to be around 96 or so.
Its not just my mud I have seen it happens on dragonswords mud as
well which uses an insane amount of color.

Ok random means that when the problem does happen, it happens
in other commands as well that use color not just this.  This was an
example where the problem seems to happen more frequent.  The
mud is fine with color as you can see in the text in my earlier post.

here is my tfrc file

/addworld -T'lp' 3k 3k.org 5000 tf3k
/addworld -T'diku' swords ds.battlegroundz.com 1234 tfswords
/addworld -T'lp' virt playtime.vtc.vsc.edu 5000
/addworld -T'lp' aca mud.acadian.net 5000
/require map.tf
/visual off
/beep off
/set wrapsize 80
/wrap on
/set prompt_usec=0
/def x = /set more=on%;/set more%;/recall %1%;/set more=off%;/set more
/load kb-bash.tf
=============================
the tf3k file has no triggers or anykind in it.  No color triggers, etc.

Since I use this on NT the color emulation is done thru
that unix emulation stuff.  But I used to use tinyfugue thru a
shell account running linux I beleive.  And I use procomm pluss
for dos which has rock solid ansi emulation for color at least.

Something is in your software that causes it, and its very annoying
to say the least.

Also what about these garbage chaacters I see that appear at the
prompt but then quickly get cleaned up a split second later.

But I wouldn't go blaming the unix emulation since this happened before
I even used it on NT.

I'll try doing what someone else said using "lpp" instead of "lp"

Because you set the prompt timeouts to 0, any non-complete line from the 
server will be treated as a prompt. Servers send non-complete 
lines for many reasons, you should either turn prompts off, or increase
the prompt timeout.


So, in answer to your question, the garbage characters you see are
because you've configured tf explictly to do that.

From /help prompts:

| lines will look like prompts, and will briefly appear in the input window 
| until the rest of the line arrives, at which time both parts of the line

Your 0 microseconds is definitely too short.  I recommend leaving it at
the default value of 250000 (1/4 second).  This will clear up your "garbage",
and possibly clear up your "bleeding" problem too.

Use variable name space with name mangling.  Ie, if you want an array
called `my_array', make variables `my_array_1' `my_array_2', etc.  You
could track the count in `my_array_size' or similar.


Simple accessor macros might be:

; /array_store <array name> <slot> <value...>
/def array_store =\
    /test ARRAY_%1_%2 := {-2}

; /array_fetch <array name> <slot>
; $[array_fetch(name,slot)]
/def array_fetch =\
    /result ARRAY_%1_%2


You can also do more complex things like multi-dimensional arrays, and
allowing names and slot entries which aren't normally legal variable
name parts.

Like something similar to the following:

There have been numerous answers to your problem now. I recall explicitely
saying that this is not a bug and suggested you to try setting %lp=off. At
that time I did not know the -T"lpp" that did this automatically. I
considered the problem solved when there was no additional responses until
only recently you restarted the subject. I still have my old mails left.

I can't duplicate this.  Did your (Mail) indicator disappear in less than
a minute with the old clock?  (It should never disappear until the mail is
read.)

I used to know what locale to use for European (Swedish) keymaps, but I
must have forgotten about it and I can't find it anywhere either. Can
anyone help me with this? (man locale says something about "ISO-8859-1",
but that doesn't work for me at least.)

(Using Linux, Debian 1.3 btw.)

I just wrote that message so that I could find where the locales were
listed, and guess what? It worked. I can now see Swedish chars in TF,
whee!

Sorry for the spam, hopefully you had a laugh at least.

I'm using tf40a7 in sunOS 5.5.1 and sometimes the escape characters of 
ansi color is choped to '['. I tried set emulation to ansi_attr and raw 
but neither of them works. any idea?
BTW, my MUD is DIKU chinese mud which is using 16-bit characters.

I tried to change colors for standard color names in a following way:

/def -i -Fp1 -P0Cmagenta -t'[Pp]urple'
/def -i -Fp1 -P0Cblue -t'[Bb]lue'
/def -i -Fp1 -P0Cred -t'[Rr]ed'
/def -i -Fp1 -P0Cyellow -t'[Yy]ellow'
/ ... same for other colors ...

and the result was that in the followin example both 'red's were in red
color. 

================Extract from the MUD inventory list ===================

a holstered belt
(Humming) a blood red stone

=======================================================================

How can I change my def's that it will catch only full words ?

Please note that I cann't just put space before red, like

/def -i -Fp1 -P0Cred -t' [Rr]ed'

because I want the red in "[Red Aura]" or (Red Ajah) to be in red color
too...

 How about this:

 /def -F -mregexp -PBCred -t'[[( ^]([Rr]ed)[](]?' red_lite1

 (including the brackets)

or

 /def -F -mregexp -PBCred -t'[ ^A-z]([Rr]ed)[ ^A-z]' red_lite2

 (disallowing text in the A-z range before and after the color name)

 Hmm, works for "skdfjh Red", "skdfjh (Red)" (coloring the first ( red
also, but does not color "hundred". Yet, "Red" in the beginning of the
line still doesn't work.. Have to experiment with that one.

 Does not work. :P I guess I have to read up on my regexp a bit.

 Okies, did some testing and stuff, and this line seems to work:
 
 /def -F -mregexp -P2BCred -t'([[( ]|^)([Rr]ed)([]) ]|$)' red_lite

When putting a tf colour on some text coming from the mud that is already
coloured, some combination of colours seem to 'add up' in a way, for ex. 
the mud sends:

An orc guard is standing here, totally unexpected

in magenta and I do 

/def -PCcyan -t'a' tmp

The magenta+cyan add up to white colour. Magenta seems to be the only
colour 'sensitive' to this, magenta from mud becoming white together with
any colour from tf and cyan from mud becoming white with magenta from tf.

I've experienced this on linux and freebsd console, rxvt, xterm, I'm sure
you can duplicate it.

If this is a real problem, solution could be additional ^[[0m:s in the
beginning of a lite and stamping the original colour at the end of it, and
handle text already bold accordingly.

For stock 40a7:

/set my_data=Something
/set field_attr=Cgreen
/set MyFields=my_data:8:%{field_attr} ......

/IF (1 == my_data) \
	/set field_attr=Cred %; \
	/eval /set status_fields=%MyFields \
/ELSE \
	/set field_attr=Cgreen %; \
	/eval /set status_fields=%MyFields \
/ENDIF

You may not need the /eval's

Hi *!

(1.)
i have been playing around with status_fields colours, but I wonder: is
it possible to change the attribute of the *whole* bar? I can't get the
'____' in a nice color (e.g. a nice reversed bar), and unfortunately I
can't program in C :(

(2.)
What would be very cool: an 'ircii style' window engine, so the screen
could look like:
         ______________________________________
	|                                      |
	|                                      |
	| [moo screen 1...]                    |

	| [moo screen 2...]                    |
	|____*metro_____________(mail)_14:54:13|
	|______________________________________|

...or are these already possible and am I just a lousy /help reader?
I think these would be very cool options which many more people would
appreciate... does anybody know how to do it?

thanx!
Walter

Here is the macro I use.  It only gets confused if I get anxious and try the
macro again before the previous spell has gone through.  I've thought of
improving it so that it'd remember a queue of spells to be cast but it doesn't
bother me enough to put in the effort.

---- cut here -------- cut here -------- cut here -------- cut here ----

; Example: /cast 'sanctuary'

; The recast function should keep a counter so that if I fail a lot, I'll stop
; recasting the spell.  This should prevent infinite loops.
/def recast = \
    /set cast_count=$[cast_count + 1] %;\
    /if /test "%cast_count" < 10 %; /then \

        /endif %;\
    /else \
        /echo Failed to cast spell %{spell} %;\
        /stopcast %;\
    /endif

; This function stops the automatic casting of spells by setting the spell to be

due to my limited skills (none(?)) in Perl and only slightly less limited

 Sounds nice and seems to do the trick. Like I said, I probably should
look into the regexp system a bit more.

This is by design.  Overlapping colors add up according to real world
rules of color addition:

red + green = yellow
green + blue = cyan
blue + red = magenta
red + green + blue = white

So, magenta plus cyan, green, or yellow will produce white.

In 40a5 - 40a7, you can use the 'n' attribute to turn off previously
existing attributes.  This conflicted with the old meaning of 'n', so
in 40a8 (not yet released) I restored the original meaning of 'n', and
assigned this new meaning to 'x'.

Works yes, "the way it should be" no :)

What we want to match is a word-boundary [Rr]ed and a word-boundary. Word
boundary is (as defined by the perl regular expression man page) is a spot
between two characters that has a word character on one side of it and a
non-word character on the other side of it (in either order), counting the
imaginary characters off the beginning and end of the string as matching a
non-word character.

What indeed is a word character is defined by the current locale. The
POSIX definition is alphanumeric and "_".

So, in perl, the language of heavens, the expression would be
m/\b[Rr]ed\b/;

And how it should be done in tf:

Since we have no direct locale accessing in tf, we have to elaborate a bit
on the word character issue. We can take the specific approach by defining
word characters as [A-Za-z0-9_]. To this we have to add the language
specific characters as '', '' or ''. Or we could say that all character
but some delimiting characters are word characters [^()[]{}<>!?. -].

I personally am in favor of the first alternative.

Also, we can not do the simple things as matching the space between
something or do zero-width positive lookahead assertions with tinyfugue's
limited regular expression syntax, so we have to confine ourselves to
matching just non-word character, red, non-word character.

So, if you ask me, I would put this as:
/def -F -mregexp -P2BCred -t'([^A-Za-z0-9_]|^)([Rr]ed)([^A-Za-z0-9_]|$)'
red_lite

There are two ways.

1) In your trigger or macro have something like this:

/if /ismacro -msimple auto_recast%;\
  /then /undef auto_recast%;\
  /break%;\
/endif%;

The /break is not strictly necessary, but I believe a good thing as it
will detect the macro being called before its time.

2) /def -ag -hREDEF g_redef

Which will simply gag all Redefined (whatever) messages.

Hello all.

  I've a question on defining worlds and creating hooks and stuff.
The mud I play on changed their login format. I want to define a new world
login thingy but don't really have the time to research it properly :P

The mud is toril.org port 9999 (it is a dikumud)
I get a series of 4 prompts for login:
The first one is:

Please enter your term type (<CR> ansi, '?' help):

(I usually type in the number 1 for generic term to skip the slow ansi
screen then toggle the term back to ansi after I log into the mud)

The second prompt is:

Do you wish to create a new character? Y/N
(I just answer with  n )

The third and fourth prompts are the standard login prompts:

By what name do you wish to be known?
Password:

Next comes a general info screen followed by:

*** PRESS RETURN:

Then comes a menu followed by:

Make your choice:

(I just select 1 to enter the mud)
Now I'm into the mud and I send a "tog term" to toggle the terminal type
back to ansi.

Currently I'm using the standard diku world and have the first two prompts
as name and pwd according to the world definition then enter name and pwd
independantly of the login hooks.

How can I define a new world to handle all this along with a series of
hooks if necessary? 

Thanks for your help in advance.

Raymond

How about something like:

/def -wtoril -t'Please enter your term type (<CR> ansi, \\'?\\' help):' = 1
/def -wtoril -t'Do you wish to create a new character? Y/N' = N
/def -wtoril -t'By what name do you wish to be known?' = /eval
${world_character}
/def -wtoril -t'Password:' = /eval ${world_password}
/def -wtoril -t'* PRESS RETURN:' = bob
/def -wtoril -t'Make your choice:' = 1 %; tog term

(I dunno how to send just a <return>. "bob" is arbitrary.)

Hey, thanks a bunch! I'll give it a shot. (btw, when I get that PRESS
RETURN msg, I have a trigger that just does /dokey NEWLINE

But one question: how do I go from here to add characters for this world
such as with the /adddiku command?

Thanks again.
Raymond

I have been having trouble using tfopen("command", 'p').  Some of the time
it works fine, but sometimes tinyfugue complains that the stream is not
readable.  Once that happens, usually finyfugue will always come up with
the same error, even if I open a seperate command by hand on tf's command
line, and try to read from it from the command line.  The only way to get
it to work at all is to restart TinyFugue.

Unfortunatly, I can't come up with any chunk of code that can reproduce
the error consistently.  Perhaps I'm going about this all wrong?

I run 4.0 alpha 7 TinyFugue on Linux.  I will include a copy of my
(somewhat messy) working code here.


/def attrib = \
  /if ({#} >= 2) %; \
    /unset attrib_line %; \
    /set attrib_stream $[tfopen(strcat("attrib.pl ", {L1}, " 2>&1"), 'p')] %; \
    /if ({attrib_stream} != -1) %; \
      /while (tfread({attrib_stream}, attrib_line) >= 0) %; \
        /if (regmatch("^ERROR: .*", {attrib_line})) %; \
          /echo %% %attrib_line %; \
        /else %; \
          /quote %-L1 `/echo %%attrib_line %; \
        /endif %; \
      /done %; \
      /test $[tfclose({attrib_stream})] %; \
    /else %; \
      /echo %% %0 failed, command failed to start? %; \
    /endif %; \
  /else %; \
    /echo %% %0 needs at least two arguments. The last argument must be a filename. %; \
  /endif


Any help is appreciated.

I tried to define the following triggers:

/def -i -P -t"[Hit Return to continue]" = /dokey NEWLINE 
/def -i -P -t"press <enter> to continue" = /dokey NEWLINE 

they worked OK , but side effect from them was that I got multiple prompts
in my input area, i.e. next prompt was not below from previous, but in the
right side from it, in the same line, like :

Try:

/def -i -q -h'PROMPT [Hit Return to continue]' = /dokey NEWLINE
/def -i -q -h'PROMPT press <enter> to continue' = /dokey NEWLINE

You might also want to add an -ag to gag them, and maybe make them create
a one shot trigger to gag the following blank line.

I've played around with the options to /log but I've not been able to log both
input and output at the same time.

Background: if I log just the output, I can't see the directions that I've been
moving in.  This means that I can't get a good feel for the layout of an area by
just looking at the log I've made.

I've made my own program to do this kind of logging when I need to do it but I'd
much rather do it inside TinyFugue so I have access to various triggers.

Has anyone set up something like this?  The resulting log file would look a lot
like the logs you get using ZMud.

Ok it took a few days, I needed to play around long enough to see if
the problem would go away after what has been suggested well suggestion
one didn't work the usec=250000 I beleive it was.  So I change the 'lp'
to 'lpp' only problem with that is that mud '>' prompt doesn't show when it
should
but I think 'lpp' will fix the problem is I can fix the '>' witth a trigger
of some sort.
My current tfrc is as follows now.

/addworld -T'lpp' 3k 3k.org 5000 tf3k
/addworld -T'diku' swords ds.battlegroundz.com 1234 tfswords

I had the same problems, now I just started it like this and it works:

/log -g <filename>
/log -i <filename>

Hi,

Is it possible, in tinyfugue to be able to type multiply commands in one
line (separated by ;'s) like in every other mud client? Or has someone
written a script to let you do this? (I'm a previous tintin++ user who
fell in love with tinyfugue at first sight, so excuse my newbieness.) 
Thanks!

 If direct input, use "/eval blah%;blah2", if in a trigger you don't need
the /eval.

Try reading the help sometimes. It helps.

Start with /help prompts and copy the EXAMPLE OF A TYPICAL WAY OF DOING
THIS.

I too am in a grumpy mood.

Hi all.
  Everytime I start up tinyfugue I type the same load commands:
/loadworld
/loadtrig
/loaddef
/loadhilite
/loadgag
/loadhook
/visual off

How can I set tinyfugue to do this automatically for me?

Thanks
Raymond

Chances are your connection to this mud failed somewhere along the way - too
many lost packets, large latency, etc.  Basically the telnet connection was
dropped, because too much time had passed since TF had last received any
information from there.

The fault is not in TF; you would see the same problem with any kind of
telnet client.  The only solutions are to reconnect, and possibly get a
better net provider (although the problem could be farther away - a traceroute
can confirm this).

Its funny with standard telnet which sux, never gets the color bleeding problem
and prompts show fine.  So there is something in this software that is not
working right.  And to the person that mention something about dots
I have no idea what the heck you are talking about.  My message was
very easy to read :) just like this one.

If you want to help fine but dont respond with lame notes like I got.

Yes. Quite simple, your link crashed somewhere along the way (a router
went down, your modem went barf, the university operator thought it'd be
fun to reboot the router, etc. etc)

Millions of possible problems, but it comes down to the fact that your
link has stopped functioning somewhere.

Mad.

Standard telnet isn't trying to separate the prompts from normal mud
output. Tinyfugue is. I must say that tinyfugue is handling the prompting
problem as gracefully as I have any software handle it, or even as
gracefully as it could be handled. /help prompts and /help protocol should
describe these very clearly. Yet you have gotten correct answers to the
question from the beginning.

As I recall you have tried for quite some time to say that there is a
problem with tinyfugue and I and some others have been trying to tell you
that there is no problem. I don't know how clearly should I put this.

> If you want to help fine but dont respond with lame notes like I got.

If you want help, fine, but don't respond with lame notes like the ones
I got.

Usually "could you help me? Am I doing something wrong here?" works better
than "help fix this bug in the software".

Sorry about the flame, I won't respond to this thread anymore, regardless
of the response

That seems to work fine.  I never tried this since I thought there'd be some sort
of file contention or something.  Thanks.

Check the file tfrc in your tf-lib if you don't have a file called
.tfrc in your home directory.
There should be those lines but starting with  ";", erase it.
If not, just create a file .tfrc in home directory and put those commands
in it.

In previous messages I just read how good TF in handling prompts.
Well it is :) But sometimes it also misses. 
For example in battles, when flow of text from the MUD is strong, after
each strike I see my prompt in output area :(.

My mud is Diku and defined as:

/test addworld("The_Great_Hunt", "diku", "tgh.lbdata.net", "4000", "name", "pass", "tgh.tf")

and my prompt is:

<550hp 185m 271mv 2974tnl (S)>

Maybe I have to gag the previous line ? It not always the same, for
example (S) is not always there ... Please help. 
Note: it will have to be partial gag, because sometimes I see prompt and
      some valuable information in the same line.
=========================================================================
Another promblem:
I have trigger that makes me to drink when I thirsty :

/def -i -P -t'You are thirsty.' = drink water

I have set /MORE=on. When I have a few screens waiting to me to hit
the TAB key, if there are a few "You are thirsty" in there, my trigger
works few times. How can I make it work only once ?

				Thanks.

There was a whole bunch on diku prompts earlier on the list, is there a
searchable archive of the list somewhere? Anyway, if your mud has a
telnetga option (i.e. config +telnetga) turn it on. That will fix broken
prompts where you have text after the actual prompt. If you don't have
such an option, do this:

/def -t'^<[0-9]+hp [0-9]+m [0-9]+mv[^>]+>(.*)' t_prompt_fix = \
  /substitute %{P1}

(You'll want to modify this when you have a real PROMPT hook so as not to
lose prompt info.)

For gagging the prompt and putting all this stuff on the status line, see
earlier discussion on this list.

I am not sure what exactly causes this, but this should help:

/def -i -P -msimple -t'You are thirsty.' t_thirsty = \
  drink water%;\
  /edit -c0 t_thirsty%;\
  /repeat -60 1\
    /edit -c100 t_thirsty

In your ~/.tfrc

/set sockmload=on

Put those triggers in a file and have the last parameter for /adddiku be
the name of the file. Also at the top of the file put:

/set login=off

and have your last login trigger set it back to on (in case you want to
play other muds for which autologin works in the background).

Why handle the prompting at all ?

I only called it a bug, because it color bleeds.  Which shouldn't happen.
Only MS calls bugs normal :) unless this software is like MS which
certain things just are too tough to fix so we just say, oh thats
normal :)

MS = Microsoft.

> Why handle the prompting at all ?

Telnet just dumps everything the screen, without caring what any of it
means.  TF does much more: separates input from output so they don't
clobber each other (in visual or non-visual mode), triggers on and
hilites incoming lines, stores lines in history where they can be
/recall'ed, etc.  For all these reasons and more, TF needs to know the
difference between a normal line and a prompt.

Most muds use unterminated prompts, which are indistinguishable from
incomplete normal lines.  These are incompatible with the way TF works,
but TF does a pretty good job of handling them correctly anyway if
lp=on and prompt_sec and prompt_usec are set to reasonable values
(the default values are usually good; both 0 is very bad).

If your mud supports the protocol described in "/help prompts", you can
avoid prompting problems by using it.  If it's not supported, ask your
mud administrators to add it.

All this said, prompt handling is only one possible cause of your color
problem.  There are also a great number of buggy terminal emulators out
there.  Just because "bleeding" occurs in TF and not in telnet does not
mean the bug is not in the emulator; TF does more complicated things with
the emulator than telnet does, and can easily uncover an emulator bug that
telnet would not.

In any case, I have not been able to duplicate any "bleeding" problem.
Prompt timing is impossible to duplicate, and I do not have your terminal
emulator, so both explanations (and others) are still possible.

Complaining and comparing me to Microsoft is not a good way to get
anything accomplished.

Kairo and everybody else, please, no more posts on this thread unless
you have some _useful_ information to contribute.

4.0 alpha 8 (6/18/1998)
-----------
Added textutil.tf library, containing /fgrep, /grep, /egrep, /copyio,
  /readfile, /writefile, /head, /wc, /tee, /fmt, and /uniq.
Added /def -E<expression> for conditional trigger/hook matching.
Added substitute(), and -a -p options to /substitute.
Added %TFPATH.
Added /listvar -v to list values only.
Added /paste -p (paragraph mode).
Added sidle() to return time since last send on a socket.
Added /color_on and /color_off.
Added /_echo.
Added standard /loaded, so any file can be made to work with /require.
Added -q (quiet) option and -t<format> argument to /recall.
Added /replace to standard library.
/recall can be interrupted (^C).
Restored pre-40a5 meaning of /list -an; now, the "x" pseudo-attribute turns
  off pre-existing attributes (see: /help attributes).
%TZ and locale variables are automatically exported, so they work as expected
  even when not explicitly exported.
Fixed unreadable handles created by tfopen() with mode "p".
Fixed update of status field when there is no variable width field.
Fixed /echo -w (with no world name).  If you used the replacement /echo
  posted on the mailing list, you should get rid of it now.  (40a5)
Fixed zombie processes left by /dc during nonblocking gethostbyname on unix.
Fixed loss of trailing spaces in escape().

Dominions                  avatar.phys-plant.utoledo. 2000   zbr

the complete address is (or was) avatar.phys-plant.utoledo.edu 
 
can this be configured?

I want to trigger the next line of output from my mud and store it in a

Until now I did it with a trigger like that:

/def -p99999 -n1 -mregexp -t'.*' get_whole_line=\
        /set variable=%{P0}

But because of the nice warning-message '% def: Warning: leading ".*" in a 
regexp is extremely inefficient.' of TF-4.0a8 I want to find another way
to do that. 

Using 

/def -p99999 -n1 -mglob -t'*' get_whole_line=\
        /set variable=%{*}

removes the leading spaces.

Any idea how to get the whole line with leading spaces without the
inefficient -t'.*'?


Bye, Stephan

I have some similar problem. I have a trigger like

/def -mregexp -p1 -t'^(.*) died\.$' getanswer2 = \

and I want to use the first part of the line to put it into a variable.
How should this be done to avoid that warning?

Thanks, Harry

I have an idler macro (sends a message to fg and bg worlds to keep them
active) that I can open at any time. However, I would like to take it one
step further, and "force" TF to run my idler whenever I have an open world.

I would assume that I need to set it to run in the '/addworld' line of each
world, and then have something to check and see if it's running already.
Or, I might want to create a "connect hook" to do the same thing.

In non-coding English...do the following:

load tfrc. Idler should NOT open automatically, as all worlds are closed by
default.
open first world.
check idler, should not be running, open idler
open second world.
check idler, should be running, leave idler alone.
open third world...(etc)

If this is the most efficient/proper way to do this, could someone explain
the basics of how to do it (or, at least what to look up...I'm not a
programmer and the help files are confusing to me).

If this is NOT the best way to do this, could someone explain what WOULD be
the best way, and again, either provide a starting example (or at least
point me in the right direction).

As a note for people concerned I might be overloading my games...this is
also an exercise in learning how to run macros/etc across several worlds.
This just seemed the simplest way to learn how (with a macro I already know
works). 

I am using tf v. 40a4 compiled for Win95/NT.

My solution to this problem may not be the most elegant, or even reasonable by
most folks' standards. However, I have a small file called ping.tf:

--- ping.tf ---- cut here ----------------------------------------------------
/def -w ping = /send think %; /repeat -w -0:05 1 /ping

/repeat -w -0:05 1 /ping
---------------- cut here ----------------------------------------------------

When you /addworld, if you specify a filename at the end of the line, it'll
load those babies up when connecting. For example:

/addworld mymux Geoff Fakeword hair.net 3456 ping.tf

In my example above, 'ping' has been defined with the -w option so that each
world has a separate loop running. A more universal solution is likely
desirable, but the implementation would be more complicated, and it wouldn't
allow you an easy means of refraining from sending to one or more worlds ...
TF's micro-processes don't seem to have terribly sophisticated IPC facilities,
though, so I'm not entirely sure how (short of brute-force scanning the output
of /ps) you could ascertain whether a macro was running or not.

I think if I were to code something like that, I would detect to see if 
%{fg_world} existed and was not empty - as when you're connected to any world,
you're always going to have that set. 

So, when you start up tf, define something like the following:
 /def idler = /if (fg_world =~ "") %; /then \
   /send -W <your choice of string here %; \
   /endif %; \
   /repeat -0:<your time interval here> 1 /idler %; \

Yeah, it'll keep running when you've got no worlds open, but you won't get any
of the 'send: Not connected' messages this way =)

It is only cut off in the /listworlds display; the full name is stored, and
used by /connect.  /listworlds -c will also display the full name.

Hi Ken,

I thought I'd just drop you a 'thanks!!' for the new html help tarball
for the alpha 8 release.

Also, for those that may want x86, glibc rpms, the set I use are at:

ftp://pc24.sr.bham.ac.uk/pub/packages/RPMS/i386/tf-40a8-1.i386.rpm
ftp://pc24.sr.bham.ac.uk/pub/packages/RPMS/i386/tf-help-40a8-1.i386.rpm

Sources, spec files etc are also there. Look under pub/packages/ for
them.

Cheers,

Mark

Yes, I noticed that. But the option -c is not always 'wanted' and
/listworlds -c does not have the same table format. Well.. but that's not
pretty bad. I don't have many long site addresses anyway @:)

Hello,

is there a way to make TF aware of multi-lined prompts (using iacga)?
Right now I get 2 lines displayed and the 3rd line gets into the prompt line.

I'd like to have a prompt trigger to put this back to a 1 line output. :-)

Thanks for any hint on that.

Harry

Hello,

I try to create a trigger on a line where one word is optional.

The trigger is like:

/def -mregexp -p1 -t'^I want (red |green )apples\.$' dummy = ...

The () can be "red ", "green " or empty. The problem is, I can't tell the
trigger that this () is optional.
Is there a way to do that or do I really have to duplicate the trigger for the
empty text?

Harry

I haven't quite mastered regexp yet, but I believe you want something like:

  '^I want (red |green )?apples\.$'

The "?" after an atom is supposed to match 0 or more as opposed to "+" which
matches 1 or more.

Hi all!

  I'm working on some triggers which involves creating unique variables
for different ppl on the fly and I am wondering what is the best way to do
this?

For instance, when I cast 'globe' on someone I want to create a variable
for that person with respect the the spell globe, store the time I cast
the spell in that variable then later when I need to see how much time is
left in the spell, check for this.

Something like this:
/def glb = cast 'globe' %1 (at this point I want to create a new variable
by appending the word GLB to the person I cast on.  if I did
/glb foo
I want to create a variable called GLBfoo and store the time I cast the
spell into this variable like /@test GLBfoo := $(/time @)

Then later I when I want to check time remaining in the spell, say it has
an average time of 200 seconds (I'd have the avg time stored in a variable
on startup, like GLOBE=200), I want to check the time remaining on this
person like 
/chktm GLBfoo
which would just simply subtract the time the spell has been active
against the avg time, not hard to do there. 

But the main question is how to I create a variable based on the %1
variable (i.e. append to other characters to make a new variable)?

Or is it very easy and i'm just overlookign something simple?

Thanks, 
Raymond

I too use ".*" in a SEND hook. Wanting to correct this inefficient code ;) I
/help regexp'ed and it suggests using %PL, but this does not work in my trigger:

/def -p30 -mregexp -h'SEND (.*[^A-Za-z]|[A-Za-z] |^)info( .*|[^A-Za-z].*|$)'
expand_info = /eval %P1information%P2

So, what is a more efficient way of producing that trigger?

/def -p30 -mregexp -h'SEND (^|[^A-Za-z])info([^A-Za-z]|$)' expand_info=\
  /eval %{PL}information%{P2}

The regexp (.*[^A-Za-z]|[A-Za-z] |^) will accept
1. anything, followed by non-alpha, or
2. anything (there is no ^ at the very beginning), one alpha, then space, or
3. nothing

You can collapse 1 and 2 down to just "anything, then non-alpha", if you
don't bind the regexp to the string start with ^.
Likewise for the end of the string, with $.

Oops, I typoed.  It should be:

I beleive these are "geek codes" or so they were called at one time.  Do a
search on that you'll prolly find a decoder.

I *thought* there was a way to define a "flag" of sorts that could be set
when the macro (/idler) was first run, and further attempts to run it would
check if it existed or not first. Well, actually, the first running would
check too. 

Let's try this in my non-programming English again.

open .tfrc. /idler should not run because no worlds are open by default.
open first world. Run idler automatically.
/Idler checks for...idler_open flag. Flag does not exist. /Idler starts.
/Idler sets idler_open flag.
open second world.
/Idler checks for idler_open flag. Flag does exist. /Idler does not start a
second process.
open third world. 
etc...

I saw something vaguely like this in a file written by Andy Mortimer who
wrote some nice, if now outdated, lib-style files, ages ago, although it
was for logging multiple worlds, not running an idler.

Is this inefficient, non-existant, or simply more complex than what others
are suggesting (basically, run multiple processes of the idler).

Speaking of this, anyone know where I might be able to find a
compiled version.  Unix shell is all well & good, but Win95 and
the other products from the boys in Redmond have made me 
disgustingly lazy.

I have an archive of some of the last known compiled versions on my MUSHing
and Tinyfugue page.


http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/1579/mush.html

All the files are archived on my site, and links to the "home" site are
provided where available.

Hi,

I've just downloaded the Alpha 8 version...Before this I used Beta 1 (I
didn't used it often..). I didn't read the 'changes' yet, but I have a few
questions:
1. I found the "fwrite()" function, but I didn't see a function to _read_
from a file. (I need some input from a file) Is there a function for this?
2. Is there a way to filter the input from the connection. I'm searching
for a function (or method), to wait-and-read from the terminal. (to wait
for a line, and then read it into a string).

The original problem was, that the input is lines with names... I have a
file with names, and want to highlight or underline the names, that are
present in the file too. But I can't read a file. And I can't filter the
lines..

Thanx for help..

Demon.

what advantages does tf in win95 give you over the unix version. can you
have tf triggers in win95 do things on your system could you imagine
linking wave files to triggers?

   Actually, I think the Windows port performs worse than the unix
version. Running in visual mode is very choppy, and I believe there are a
few things unsupported in the Windows port, but off hand I forget what
they are.
   I was kinda disappointed, since I really like TF, and the only other
usuable client for Windows is Zmud, which I hate.

I'm too tired to think of advantages (if any), and probably couldn't think of
any anyway :) But I do know that I love you. Sorry, that's another mailing list.
I meant I do know that it is possible to link the playing of sound files from
triggers.

OK bye.

I think you can do this under linux too. You can execute scripts from
triggers (I think).. I saw a command to do this somewhere..

Hi,

Somebody wrote something from playing sound file on triggers under Win95..
You can do this under linux simply using command "/sh" or "/sys". OK?
It tooooooo simple... ((:
But somebody could really help me on my problem: how to read from file.
(write= fwrite()) Or is that impossible?

Bye.

Actually I find TF to perform much better under Linux than Win95.  Its nice
to have both versions available though, since I'm forced to use Win95 at
work.  It is possible to link sound files to triggers in both versions.

From tfopen():

  "r"     Open a file "<name>" for reading.  (see also: "/quote '").  

From tfread():

tfread
  The tfread(handle, variable) function reads a line from the stream 
  designated by <handle>.  If <handle> is omitted, the tfin stream is
used.  
  If successful, the line is assigned to <variable>, and tfread() returns
the 
  (non-negative) length of the line.  If <variable> did not already exist,
it 
  is created at the global level, as if by /set.  If there are no lines 
  available to read, or an error occurs, tfread() returns -1.  For "r" and
"p" 

(Okay. That looks fucked up :)

So something like:
/test file_handle := tfopen("~/tf/names)%;\
/if (file_handle == -1) \
  /return%;\
/endif%;\
/set result=0%;\
/while (result != -1) \
/test result := tfread(file_handle, name)%;\
/echo %{name}%;\
/done

Something like that.. Or read it in a number of different variables, or
whatever.

Mad.

- From what I know, there are no advantages under Lose95.  The main 
advantage of *porting* it to that OS is that it can be used by more 
people.  Other than that, I don't know the specifics on that port.

And hey, if we get the whole Lose95 community using TF and loving it, 
maybe they'll demand more performance, and that'll be the start of the 
mass exodus to Unix..

Well, I can dream, can't I?

OK, I've been slack in updating and maintaining my archive of prebuilt and
self installable TF for Win32's..  My apologies.  I will have it updated and
ready for download in about an hour at
http://www.randomc.com/~hawkmoon/tinyfugue.html

Now the argument about use Linux is fine and dandy.  I like Linux, but this
is a TF list not a comp.os.advocacy.* list.  Frankly Win95 may indeed suck
but it pays my bills, and Linux doesn't yet I code for both.  Ken has busted
his A** creating a great platform for us to work on and we should say thank
you.

That said, yes the Win32 port does perform worse, because the Windows
Console does some non-unixish things to manage itself, so UNIX code doesn;t
always port well.  Ask the guys that did BitchX.  /sh and /quote! also
behave oddly, because pipe support is seriously broken, but I'm working
around that.   I will also be looking at cobbling in support for some

First, I am sorry if I seemed ungrateful with my critique. I am very
thankful that someone is taking the time and effort to port TF to
Winblows, I know it can't be an easy task, especially with so little
support to do unix to M$ ports. I tend to be direct and honest and usually
will speak whatever is on my mind, I guess this tends to get taken as
being rude, afraid I can't help it.

Win95 TF has several _disadvantages_ over unix TF, including:

* Scrolling in visual mode is jumpy. 
* /quote ! (and code that calls it, like /sys) is not supported. 
* Compressed files are not supported. 
* Nonblocking hostname resolution (%gethostbyname) is not supported. 

The only real advantages to win95 TF are those you get from running TF
locally, assuming your unix account is remote (or you don't have a unix
account), and you run win95 locally.  Of course, running unix locally
with unix TF will give you the advantages of both unix TF and local
execution.

Running TF locally (especially if your net connection is a modem) will
eliminate typing lag, especially when you're downloading over the link
simultaneously.

Another advantage of running locally (whether in unix, os/2, win95, or
whatever) is that you can have your TF run programs (like audio players)
on your local machine that don't make sense to run remotely.  However,
since /quote ! is not supported in the win95 version, this ability is
somewhat limited in win95.

Most of this is correct, however, I have unreleased builds that include a
/we command that don't really emulate /quote! but does allow native
execution, it is the equivalent of using the start menu to run something and
does not return a value (I get around that via a DLL that dumps info back to
the keyboard buffer.

I can release the code should Ken wish to include the code in the
distribution, it's a clone of the /sh code that calls the Native WinExec
function instead.  IT's a quick hack that fills my needs for things like
triggered displays of the logs in another window.

Compressed files aren;t really an issue IMO on Win32 platforms, disk is
cheap and since WinBloat is a standardized feature of Windows, most of us
have an extra 300k to work with (and on NT Compression at the directory
level is in the OS).

The host name resolution is an issue but won't be resolved any time soon
since WinSock is the core problem there.

The Jumpy visual is my off an on background project (when not working on the
mud driver itself or real world work) and is comng along nicely.  There are
a couple of things to keep in mind with the Win32 version.  A console window
will never be up to the quality of VT100 or a good X-Term, but as the port
of BitchX hasproven, it can be done.

OK, it took a little longer than an hour.  I decided to flesh out the
webpage a little as well.

TinyFugue 4.0 alpha 8 pre-compiled and self installable is now available at
http://www.randomc.com/~hawkmoon/tinyfugue.html

The Archive is about 1.8 meg as it includes the source and the Cygnus DLL.
Together those are roughly 1 meg.  If Ken would be OK with making the
sources a seperate Download, that should reduce the size by about 400k.

Hi,

Im totally tired.. I can't even remember my name.. I'm programming this
thing the whole day, and I can't continue now, but I have a syntactical
problem, I wanna solve before final shutdown..
My line:
/def all = /for i 1 %{#} /echo %{%%{i}}
                               ^^^^^^^^
I want to echo all parameters of the "all" command. But I'm totally
braindead now.. Can you help me?
The original problem was to create a command that concatenates all of its
parameters to 1 variable.
Thanx.

Demon.

Apparently you were to tired to remember that %{*} already contains all the
parameters.

Hi all,

First of all, I am a new user of TinyFugue, so if I'm asking something
stupid, please flame gently :)

I'd like to scrollback the world history display: if you normal see lines
1 - 50 (counted from the *end* of the buffer), you can press PageUp and 
lines 51 - 100 are displayed, &c. Much like the scrolling in an xterm or
on Linux console. I'm quite sure somebody must have implemented it, as it
seems a useful feature to me. However, if there is not a simple way, I'll 
try to program it. I guess tf is powerful enough to support this.

Thanks in advance for your help.


Jitse Niesen.

Hi

Thanx for *. :-/
The nexto problemo: Is there a way to create a trigger, that executes when
a defined time is ellapsed...
My server kicks me out, when my idle is appr 10 minutes.. I know there's
the idle() function, but can I use it to solve the problem?
I mean is there a way to create a trigger that goes on, when I don't do
anything for 10 minutes?

Demon.

Ps.:Yes, it _is_ possible, that I didn't read the help with enough

Sorry about the mistake yesterday.  The copy that was on the server had a
bad chcksum and would not decompress.  That's fixed as of this morning.

I have programmed such a macro a while ago, but I have one problem with it:

If the history contains very long lines (mainly output from /list, but
some lines from my mud are very long, too), then a '/recall -g 20' can
result in 30 or more lines of output on the screen.

Now I can browse through the history by pressing PgUp+PgDown, but
everytime a part of the history contains very long lines, a few lines of
the history scroll out of the screen.

Is there any way to determine the amount of lines on screen needed by a
/recall without really /recall'ing the history?


Bye, Stephan

Yes, of course. But let me know, if there is a more effective way to
realise such a macro, please. I am still learning how to write macros with
TF.

Here it is (the strange variable names are a mixture of english and
german ;-):

Hi pals,

I've found a few commands for timing, but thanx for trying to help ((:
"/repeat", and "/at".
I'm just afraid, that I will fail my exams, 'cos I spend my time to
customize TF... (by the way..My exam is about programming :)))

I have used some time reading help files and different help pages on the
net, but I am still wondering about the strange codes used to bind
something to a key.  I have tried /def -B in stead and write F0 and F1 and
similar, but I can not get it to work.  Is there a table of these strange
codes somewhere, someone must have put that together :)

Thank you on beforehand, Morten-Christian Bernson

/def -b'<code>' name=\
  <some action>

The codes look like this:

control characters:  caret letter e.g. ^a is control A
escape characters: caret left-bracket letter e.g. ^[w is esc w
Function characters: caret left-bracket 1 digit tilde
  e.g. ^[[12~ is F2.

Function characters and arrows can also be used with -B'F1' and -B'Left'.

/list -i -b (partial list) gives:
/def -i -b'^W' = /DOKEY BWORD   (esc-w)
/def -i -B'Up' = /dokey_up      (up-arrow)
/def -i -B'F1' = /help          (F1)
/def -i -b'^P' = /dokey recallb (control-p)

seems that there is no equivalont sleep function in tf. I know repeat 
can do a similar thing but not very similar. what I need is a function 
like sleep in shell. something like:

/command1%;/sleep 10%;/command2%;...

will do command1, sleep for 10 secs, then command2, ..., etc.

anyone?

1) I think /repeat is really want you want; just combine the trailing
   commands in the repeat, or put them in a macro to be called by
/repeat:
 /command1 %; /repeat -0:0:10 1 /command2 %%; ...
or
 /def command2 = command 1 %; command 2 %; etc
 /command1 %; /command2

2) If you really want to wait 10 seconds to do anything:
/command1 %; /sys sleep 10 %; /command2 %;...

Hello!

The versions 4.0a5-a8 behave different from the versions before. Now you
can use a partial hilite to display a previous /gag'ed line. Is this a bug
or a feature?

For example take two triggers like these:

/def -p2 -F -agCblue -mregexp -t'jumps around.' gag_1

/def -p1 -P1Cred -mregexp -t'(Mike)' hilite_1


The first trigger should /gag every line with 'jumps around.'. So long as
the person who is jumping around is not Mike the trigger does his job.

But the line 'Mike jumps around.' gets displayed in blue with 'Mike' in
magenta. The attribute 'g' got lost.



Bye, Stephan

idle() and sidle() got reversed.  This will be fixed in the next release.

The scrolling in visual mode for the win version is supposed to be jumpy,
I know... but does this mean that it's just not clean scrolling, or that
the visual mode isn't working properly at all, as if in unix the termcap
wasn't properly defined? Because I can't even get the status line to stay
put... just rolls right off with the rest of the text. Is that the
behavior everyone else is getting or have I not configured something
right?

I am looking for a way to use the MUSH nospoof flag in a more efficient and 
easy to read manner. As it works now, when you enable it, you get a line 
like:

[Frances(#1096)] Frances wheee

What I want to do is gag the '[Frances(#1096)] ' on normal output, leaving
only the 'Frances wheee' part, but when I do /recall, have the nospoof
information there. Does anyone have any ideas where to start with this?

Jamie

Take a look at /help substitute.
Other options include gagging the original text (with -aGg to keep it out of
/recall too) and /echoing the text (and /recordline'ing the new text to
history) (more complicated than /substitute), and a server-side solution
such as changing the spoof prepend string (most spoofs allow this) to
something shorter.

Simply use:

"Jumpy" means that when the output window scrolls one line, the status bar
scrolls up with it and almost immediately returns to its proper position.
The display should never be incorrect for more than an instant.  I don't
know all the things that can go wrong with cygwin or windows consoles,
but one possibility is that you are trying to use a bad window size.

Use a trigger with substitute() to rewrite the line, -aG to prevent
this it being recorded, and /recordline to record the full line:

/def -aG -mregexp -t'^\\[[^ ]+\\(#[0-9]+\\)\\] ' rewrite_nospoof = \
    /recordline -w %P0%PR%; \
    /test substitute({PR})

Actually, I think a better regex would be '^\\[.+\\(#[0-9]+\\)\\] ', since
the one Ken stated will fail on any player name or object name that has

Ok, I had a bunch of weird things happening. First the visual mode wasn't
working, but the /more mode was... then somehow I got the visual mode
started working, but then all my keybindings for tab and the arrow keys
went out the window... % dokey: No editing function page
That's all it kept saying, or % dokey_up: dokey_up: no such command or macro

I try to use this library file kb-bash.tf to bind the Up key to previous 
command and Down for next command but it does't work. In line 19 of 
kb-bash.tf, "/def -iB"up" = /dokey recallb", is correct. so I try 
kbbind.tf, the file defines key Up, Down, etc and found something I 
don't understand: 

It binds /dokey_up to ^[[A which is correct in line 35 and try to bind 
it again to ^[OA in line 40.
 
In fact, I found that it actually bind ^[OA to recallb when my tf try to 
load kb-bash.tf, this is the message:

% kb-bash.tf, line 19: def: Redefined binding ^[OA

I know ^[[A is the up key but what is ^[OA?
How can I work it out?

Hi.

I have a few prolems. It's kinda funny.. ((:
I don't know howto get the return value of a macro/command.
Ex.: /repeat returns the process id of itself. (or not?)
     And I want to kill it. But I don't know howto get the
     return value of it.
Or I wantto get the return value of a /def. HOW?

Thanx for help in advance.

Demon.

Just after you call your /repeat or /def command, take a look at %?

/help %?
  ?       The integer return value of the most recently executed 
          command (builtin or macro).  

When writing your own macros, the return value will be the same as the
return value of the last command done inside it.  To invent your own
return value, do this:  /test <expression> (e.g. /test 1), since /test
explicitly sets %?.

Oops, one more thing about return values: in version 4.0 you can also set
the return value of a macro with /return and /result (preferred method).

I use /ps to list the processes.  The PID will be listed next to the
/repeat.  Then just /kill #.

There should be some way to enable flash, ie the ansi codes ^[[?5h and
^[[?5l, combined they give a nice flash effect that some muds use, now
they're seen only when emulation=raw.

A /flash command similar to /beep would be appropriate too.

What would be -really- nice is to gag it -except- when the actual line
-doesn't- start with the name in the 'nospoof' part ...  anybody game
to write that one?

While I'm asking questions, here's one that's been causing some hair
loss;  I figure the answer is easy, but I'm just not seeing it.

Here's the macro:

/def jive = /quote -S say !"echo %* | jive"

It works fine until I try to pass it a metacharacter (' ", etc..)
For some reason, I can't seem to escape %* before I send it to the
shell, and it causes an unexpected end of file.
I've tried various uses of /escape ' and $(/escape '), but for some
reason, it never escapes the text.

I've noticed that the window seems to freeze up.  When I ALT-TAB to
another application and then back, it resumes.  This happens a lot when
I first start it, and then it becomes more intermittent as time goes on.

Any ideas what could be causing it or has anyone had similar problems?

I'm trying to make a list of directions ({ "w","s","e","s", ... })

but I can't seem to get anywhere.

Anyone have any suggestions?

When I was a kid my favorite relative was Uncle Caveman. After school we'd
all go play in his cave, and every once in a while he would eat one of us.
It wasn't until later that I found out that Uncle Caveman was a bear.

I use the very same macro. You must escape it when typing it at the command
line, eg. "/jive Aha, Mr. Bond. I\\'ve been expecting you\\!".
Or you could write a function which returns its given argument with the
characters escaped, like I did with my talker.
I have not looked at /escape yet. I will later tonight.

If I understand you correctly, all you should have to do is change the dopath
macro:

/def -i dopath  = \
    /if ( {1} =/ '[0-9]*' & {#} >= 2 ) \
        /for i 1 %1 %2%;\
        /dopath %-2%;\
    /elseif ({#}) \
        %1%;\
        /sh sleep 60%;\
        /dopath %-1%;\
    /endif

This doesn't address placing a pause between multiple moves (like /dopath 6 n)
but you can always avoid that by using "/dopath n n n n n n".

Instead of trying to counteract the shell's metacharacter evaluation,
avoid it altogether using an environment variable:

    /def jive = \
        /setenv ARG=%*%; \
        /quote -S say !echo "$$ARG" | jive%; \
        /unset ARG

The old quote-style version of /egrep is still in %TFLIBDIR/grep.tf
where it always was, and is not compatible with the new tfin-style
defined in %TFLIBDIR/textutil.tf; if you load both files, which one you
get depends on the order of loading and on your setting of %redef.

I recommend using the textutil.tf version.

The %| pipe only works in macro body evaluation, so to use it on the command
line, you must do it in /eval or have %sub > 0.

  /eval /list %| /egrep whatever

Also, in this particular example, /list options may be a better choice:

  /list -mregexp = whatever

(assuming you're searching for "whatever" in macro bodies, not their names).

Ok, just noticed something wierd when I do logging with 4.0a7.
Previous versions, when handed output from the mud in the form:

(fred) thrt


(george) gertrhr


(jim) reghhwt

would log exactly that.  40a7 removes all the blank lines, making my
logs very painful to read.  Does anyone know why? Did I miss something
when reading the changes stuff?

TIA

:/ How can I get the return value of a command, eg /listworlds -s or
/listsockets -s without having it echo the result to the screen?

/def tmp = /listworlds -s %; /let aha=%? %; /echo \%: aha: %aha

...puts the return value into %aha but still echos all the worlds to the screen.
I also tried piping the /listworlds -s into /return %?, but still no avail :(

how about allowing multiple worlds in /def -w, eg "/def -w'aha,mr,bond'", or
would the comma be considered part of the world name? (some other
separator could be used). whatever, just a thought.

There are at least two ways to do this already.

1) Define those worlds with a special type, and use /def -T:

  /addworld -T"tiny.muck.007" aha ...
  /addworld -T"tiny.muck.007" mr ...
  /addworld -T"tiny.muck.007" bond ...
  /def -T"*007*" ...

  The "tiny." part (or whatever you use) will still match the standard
  LOGIN hooks.

2) As of 40a8, you can use /def -E:

  /def -E"${world_name}=~'aha' | ${world_name}=~'mr' ${world_name}=~'bond'" \
     ...

or, assuming you don't have spaces in your world names:

  /def -E"strstr('aha mr bond', ${world_name}) >= 0" ...


I recommend method #1, because it's simpler and more efficient.  For
more complex conditions, use /def -E; it can implement any condition
you want.  All that's required is the expression syntax you already
know and love :) instead of a special /def option for each possible
condition a user might want.

My logs indicate no change in this since at least 35b4, and I can't
duplicate this in 40a7 or 40a9.

Or, on a similar note, allowing you to define a world, then open multiple 
instances of it as something like 1.WORLD, 2.WORLD, or WORLD1, WORLD2...

This will execute *all* of the commands every X minutes, forever.  Michael 
only wants one at a time, stopping at the end of the list.

This technically works (except for the repeat count handling), but it locks
up TF for 60 seconds between each move so he can't do anything else while
waiting.

I suggest a macro similar to /dopath that echoes instead of executes:

    /def echopath  = \
        /if ( {1} =/ '[0-9]*' & {#} >= 2 ) \
            /for i 1 %1 /_echo %2%;\
            /dopath %-2%;\
        /elseif ({#}) \
            /_echo %1%;\
            /dopath %-1%;\
        /endif

and another macro that uses /quote to execute each echoed line with the
(nonblocking) delay:

    /def slowpath = /quote -%1 -dexec `/echopath %-1

which is used like:

    /slowpath 0:0X w s e s ...

Piping to /return works, you just have to remember that %| is only evaluated
in a macro body, so to do it on the command line you need to /eval.

Unfortunately, it seems that many termcap/terminfo databases don't have
vb/flash entries, and I'm not sure that this feature is important
enough to hardcode.

Is there any way to code a Tinyfugue macro to, when queried by the MOO server,
reply with the user's connection name?  Example: Joe connects to my unix
server, and runs Tinyfugue.  Tinyfugue connects to my MOO, but the MOO can
only
see that Joe's connecting from my unix server.  It can't see where Joe
connected to the unix server from.  How would I code a Tinyfugue to forward
that information to the server?

The tinyfugue I downloaded from http://www.randomc.com/~hawkmoon/ works
perfect
I doesn't color bleed at all.  Anyways I'll explain how I get flashing
text to work under
TF in NT, first I goto the dos prompt, then hit full screen, I then run
edit and exit it
right after.  Now for somereason this enables flashing to work in TF as
long as you
dont switch out of the dos session, if you do you'll need to run edit
again and exit it.

Now I called Microsoft tech support they gave me the ussual crap like I
dont know sir.
Now if this can be done manualy there must be a way to hardcode it into
the NT version
so that flashing will always be enabled.

Another fix to something unrelated.  If anyone has ever experience
wrapping not working
correctly under NT, meaning if you were to display 2 lines of text
exactly 80 characters long
they would take up 3 lines, the reason for this is the display (dos box
is only 80 columns wide)
what I do is use "mode 81" this extends the dos box to 81 columns, then
in TF its self I set
wrapping to 80, this allows for correct wrapping.  I am sure this
problem is not in TF
its self but cygwin terminal emulation.

When I said flash wasn't worth hardcoding, I meant in the TERMCAP
option, for users with deficient termcap/terminfo databases; of
course the flash code would be hardcoded in the HARDCODE option.

Switching from HARDCODE to TERMCAP may in fact have the opposite of the
desired effect on TF's ability to flash:  with HARDCODE, TF would have
the flash code for vt100 hardcoded; but with TERMCAP it very often
would _not_ get the flash code, since many termcap/terminfo databases
do not have that code in their vt100 entries (although I don't know if
that's true or not for the database that comes with the cygwin
termcap).

There is actually no advantage to using termcap in cygwin TF.  The
purpose of termcap is to allow applications to run on any terminal
without knowing the details of every possible terminal.  But cygwin
emulation is vt100 compatible, so vt100 is the only terminal cygwin TF
needs to know, and it already does know about it in HARDCODE.  Making
cygwin TF use termcap would only add to the startup time and size of
the binary and make users download an additional package with its
additional installation complexities, for no improvement.  (This is not
to say that termcap is never useful with cygwin; it IS useful for
porting unix applications that depend on termcap and don't have the
option of using hardcoded vt100 codes.  TF only does so because in 1990
my predecessor felt enough users lacked termcap for the HARDCODE option
to be worth it.  If I had to make the same decision in 1998 I would
probably tell such users to get with the times, but since it's already
in there I might as well leave it there.)

In general, no.  There is no portable user command to get the address of
the host from which the user connected.  Non-portable methods include
finger, who, and writing your own program.

In any case, any information the MOO receives from such a macro would
be almost useless for identification purposes, since you can not trust
the TF user to use your macro.  The only possibly trustworthy ways of
getting that information are outside of TF.

Hello all,

This is my first post here so please dont flame me if this has been
discussed already...

My problem is I use TF from alot of different systems, and like to bind
the keypad keys
for different stuff, like walking in directions, ect..

Well this is kinda hard sometimes, since the keypad don't generate a
string on most systems.
on my linux box I'v remaped the keypad to functionkeys F13 an up, but I
can't do that on
some other systems, so basiclly what I'd like it to be able to BIND with
keycodes rather
then character sequence. I think that's what they do in clients like
powwow and cancan.
most of my friends use powwow and they don't have this problem, but I'm
used to work
with TF and whould like to continue with this.

On some systems I can bind the keypad but then the "arrow keys" get
bound too
and that's not acceptable... They are after all different keys and
generate different
keycodes.  I know keycodes is a consept not used in non X systems but
most TF
users use it in a xterm or simular. Why not add this as an option like:
/bind -k123 = /echo Keycode 123

If there is another way to make it work please say so, and I'll be happy
:)

Your's
     Bjrne

PS.
    Also any1 have a good package to add and remove entries in a list?
DS.

Often, the problem on many PCs is that the low-level "scan-codes" are not
available to the programmer and only the translated ASCII codes are.
Hence, the availability of the function keys but not the left shift, which
has its own scan code.  To be able to tap into these on so many varied
systems would mean a great amount of additional coding, plus intimate
knowledge of the individual machines.  However, I don't know all about
other machines, so I would appreciate other comments.

I have something which does what you want. It worked on older versions, but is
messy on the new versions. (Included attachments. Hmm, I can't send
attachments to this list, so I've put them at the end of this body;)).

I have tried:

/def tmp = /let aha=/listworlds -s %| /return %? %; /echo \% aha: %?
/def tmp = /let aha=/listworlds -s %%| /return %? %; /echo \% aha: %?

The latter gives me an aha value of 1, but I have more worlds :/

/eval /let aha=$(/eval /listsockets -s) %; /echo \% %?

...and other permutations. But my response is always 'grr!'. Please give me
something that will put the number of sockets or worlds into a variable in a
macro body :S

How can I exclude words from regexp patterns ?

Suppose I have this:

/def -mregexp -t"^([^ ]+) tells you "

And I want to exclude "Foo tells you .."

How do I do that?

Thanks, Duckie

They both return 1.  The latter also echoes "aha: 1".  Echoing
is not the same as returning.  Of course, neither is what you want:
it looks more like you're trying to store the string "/listworlds -s"
in the variable "aha" and pipe its 0 lines of output to the next command;
the %? in the next command is the return value 1 of the successful /let.

Both %| and %; separate commands.  With %; the output of the first goes
to tfout (usually the screen) and the input of the second comes from
tfin (usually the keyboard).  But with %| the output of the first goes
into the input of the second.  If the second doesn't actually read input,
%| effectively sends the output of the first to nowhere.  This is a useful
trick when you want to discard the output of the first.  For example:

  /def tmp = /listworlds -s %| /let aha=%? %; /echo \%: aha: %aha

Since /let does not read input, the output of /listworlds is just discarded.

Often it's more clear to move this trick into a simple macro that does
nothing else:

  /def countworlds = /listworlds -s %* %| /return %?

so that you don't have to use the trickery in your main code:

  /def tmp = /countworlds %; /let aha=%? %; /echo \%: aha: %aha

Excerpt from /help tfio:
  ...
  tfread() from the keyboard is special.  It can only be done from a command 
  line command; trying to do it directly or indirectly from a trigger, hook, 
  keybinding, or process is an error, and will make the tfread() return -1.  
  ...

Why is this?  This behavior makes tfread('i', ...) almost useless to me.
Is there any way I can convince it to do it anyway?  Are there any
alternatives or workarounds, aside from invoking a shell to read input and
dump the result to a file? (I would like it to be completely tf based.)

Thanks,
Chris

I've noticed an apparent bug since 4.0a1 (I think.  Since a3 at least, and
it wasn't on the last version before 4.0a1) that only comes up on OS/2. 
Using the same version on Linux doesn't have the problem.

/recall seems not to work when it comes to any lines that are put in the
history by a command (/echo, /quote, /recordhistory) refuse to show up in
the history when recalled.  The lines are apparently added to the correct
history buffer, but /recall can't get the lines.  As an example, if I'm
connected to a world "Complex", then do "echo -wComplex Hi!", it displays,
but then when I try recalling ten lines from that world, it only shows me
the last nine. as long as the echoed line is in the past ten.

If anyone can help with this I'd really appreciate it, thanks.

Sounds like it's familiar to my multi-line prompt message but up to now I did
not get any response either - so you might not get any reply too. :-(

You can't trigger on multiple lines per se, you can only work with one line at a
time.  You'd have to write triggers for each line, setting flags, then check all
the flags on the last line.

Multi-line triggers are made one line at a time, eg.

/def -t'first text' = \
	/def -p2 -t'next text' = \
		/def -p2 'third 'text%;\
	/def -F -t'*' = clear triggers

It needs a bit rigging, Ken Keys might implement an expect type system
sometime. But it's doable pretty easily.

Multi line prompts can be handled by triggering the previous line of the
prompt and putting it in a variable and then triggering the second line of
the prompt and displaying both

/def -t'first prompt line' = /set prompt_save=%*
/def -h'HOOK second prompt line > ' = /prompt %prompt_save %*

But remember that tinyfugue doesn't support more than screen width - 1
characters in prompt, eg. tinyfugue can't display multi-line prompts.

You might also pick up all the info you need from the first line of the
prompt and put it into the status line if you like.

Andy.

On your webpage, it says the .exe file is alpha 8.
Is it really alpha 10 and you forgot to change the text?  Or is it alpha
10?

Check the output of /listsockets, e.g.

  /def connected = /result $$(/listsockets -s) =/ "*{%{*}}*"
or
  /def connected = /result $(/listsockets -s %| /fgrep -c - %*)

after setting /set emulation=raw
I noticed an interesting thing, all color codes like <esc>[32;1m
will appear in white from experimenting I found this to be
because of the ending 1m.  Now a real ansi color emulator
is not this dumb I wrote one years ago.  Which didn't have to
take the numbers after the '[' in a certain order to get the
color.  What I need to do to is fix this is in raw mode to be able
to use a trigger to capture all esc codes theres like 4 or 5 of them
for the highligted colors and switch them around.  So if
<esc>[32;1m comes in I want to trap that code switch it to
<esc>[1;32m and send it to my terminal giving me higreen
instead of white.  If this is possible please send me examples.

Thanks.

I have a bunch of highlighting for pages and stuff, and they all
start with the same fairly complicated regexp - one that matches
peoples' names.  I want to set the regexp to a variable so I
can just include the variable ... is there any way of doing it except
for putting /eval in front of every line?

Is it possible to disable the scrollback feature in the windows version?
I can't get it to stop causing the screen to jump.

If you're loading from a file, yes.
If you're typing in the /def from the command line, then you'd need /sub on.

Why not a wrapper around /def for these hilites?

e.g.

/def hilite_name=\
  /def <flags> -t'...%{*}...'

/hilite_name Bob
/hilite_name Mary
/hilite_name Joe

Now I am using Tinfyfigue on windows NT4.0 SP3
using Cygwin32 beta 19.1.  This was precompiled
by andi satori I beleive.

Now if you /set emulation=raw all the above codes
will appear white that end in 1m
if you /set emulation=ansi_attr everything is fine.

But I like raw mode for one reason color bleeding
problem goes away in raw mode.  Yes the problem
I been complaining about since the dawn of time.

So I need someway where a color code lets take
hi magenta <esc>[35;1m can work as <esc>[1;35m
needs to work both ways in raw mode.  Please
anyway this can be done would be appreciated.

It took me a few days to figure out just why
this was happening as well.

I have a strange thing happening every time I start up TinyFugue.
In my tfrc file I redefine the default file names from tiny.macros,
tiny.trig, tiny.world etc to world.tf, macros.tf, trig.tf, etc
(as recommended) and it works great.  The only problem is that I get a
message that the macros HILITEFILE, MACROFILE, etc have been redefined. No
problem there, except that when it loads commands from the macros.tf file,
the same messages repeat.  It seems that when I do a "/savedef" all the
settings such as /set MACROFILE, /set HILITEFILE, etc are saved in that
file as well.  I can easily go in and delete them from the file but then
every time I create a new macro and use the /savedef command, it saves all
these things as well and thus the redefinition run amuk messages.

How can I configure /savedef so it won't save these to the macros.tf file?
Incidentally, I don't mind the first set of messages, but I hate the spam
that accompanies the repetition.

Thanks,
Raymond

That would get pretty ugly.

A more simple solution would be to add your new macros to the file, and
then /load the file again.  Then you can format your macros and triggers
etc as well.

To save yourself the spam of 'redef' messages, you can gag them.

/def -p1 -ag -mglob -h'REDEF ' redef_hook

The tinyfugue beta 8 from hawkmoon, it says /sh command works but when I
try
it it just doesn't do anything.

/sh
% Executing shell:
% Resuming TinyFugue.
/sh tracert 3k.org
% Executing command: tracert 3k.org
% Resuming TinyFugue.

I get stuff like, so whats the problem ?
TF its self works fine though.

This is a quirk of how Beta 19.1 of the Cygnus DLL manages some things.
This is the result of going from Beta 18 to 19.1.  I implemented a /we
command to hack around this for private use, and caneasily compile a build
that includes it fro general distribution.

Personally (and as Karen Etheridge already suggested on this list), I
always edit my macros in the file and then /load the file, rather than
edit in tf and then /save.  That way, the file remains nicely formatted
(including comments), and I can organize them by their purpose instead
of having them all in one big file (I have a LOT of macros).

But, if you want to use /save*, you could /def your *FILE macros with -i
so they don't get /save'd or /list'ed.

Another solution is to gag the redef messages.  A simple gag like this:

  /def -agG -hREDEF gag_redef

will gag ALL redefs, which may be undesirable; you may prefer a more
specific gag like this:

  /def -agG -mregexp \
    -h'REDEF macro ^(LOG|MACRO|HILITE|GAG|TRIG|BIND|HOOK|WORLD)FILE$' \
    gag_redef_file

The gag method will also prevent the first set of messages.

Hrm, very nice suggestion.  I think I may opt for this method.  Thanks a
ton to both you and Karen!

Very interesting.  I'll have to analyze this to see how it works. Heh. I
love learning new cool jiffy things to do with tf.

I have another question I'll save for a new msg, thanks guys!

Ok, I've been argueing in support of tinyfugue over tintin but not really
having used tintin I don't have much base for an arguement except that I
really love tinyfugue.  Also, I run across a ton of Zmud users and tell
them about the precompiled tinyfugue for windows by hawkmoon but they
claim zmud is better.  Can anyone give me some valid arguements for
convincing someone to use tinyfugue?  I have seen both tintin and zmud but
never really used them and have no intentions of trying to learn.  I guess
what I'm looking for is some 'bullets'.  

My current, albiet unsupported arguement is that there is practically no
limit to what you can do with tinyfugue, but that tintin and zmud are
limited.

Are there any former zmud or tintin users out there who would care to
provide me with some ammunition in support of tinyfugue over those other
programs?

Thanks,
Raymond

I have 2 worlds where I regularly have the message

"You own a floating room: " and then the room name. This message appears
about 5 times in each world, one after the other (to indicate I have a
collection of floating rooms in each).

I would like to gag these messages, so that I don't have to see them all
the time. 

An example of the messages as they appear is included below:

You own a floating room: Strangler Trees (4 9 0)(#1696)
You own a floating room: DS Recycled Room(#4408)
You own a floating room: DS Recycled Room(#4442)

Here's one good reason to use TF over zMUD.
TF macros and triggers are usable by both UNIX and Win32.

When a zMUD user goes to visit someone else and is mudding from a
machine other than their own, they are macro-less.

A TF user can use his/her macros whereever he/she goes, regardless of
what computer and what platform he/she is mudding from.

For me, that's key because I login from a variety of locations.  Also,
if I go from my home PC (using TF on windows 95) to another location, I
can just use a unix shell account as I keep the same macros on my PC as
I do on my unix account.  I'm never macro-less.

/def -Fq -aGg <-w or -T> -mregexp -t'^You own a floating room: ' gag_floatrooms

You can do one /def for each of the two worlds with -w, or set up
these two worlds to match a certain world type and use -T (remember the -T
flag can use partial matches)

I feel like even more of an idiot. I read the help twice...and I now
realize that gagged messages don't trigger the activity message.

Please just disregard this question completely, and I'll go hide my head in

Sorry, I realized this was a simple gag (and I know how to do that from the
help files). I'm not certain if this will prevent the "activity in world
<x>" messages from showing up or not, though...

Same arguements to induce them to use Linux and not Win95/Win98/WinNT.  If
they won't attempt the platform switch, a fully-native client with native
GUI is difficult to beat.

Actually, I have an 'auto-kill' macro that watches for signs of a KILL_OK
flagged player.  TinyFugue simply turns the KILL_OK flag on my player,
slays them with 100% (Costly, but works every time it's used), and turns
my KILL_OK flag back off.  They ask how I did that.  I answer,
"TinyFugue." This makes for an elloquent statement of TinyFugue.

Personally, the reason I use TinyFugue is because it's got a simple
interface, yet it's powerful, and at the same time portable.  You can
use it from a GUI, or use it in a dial-up session from your graphing
calculator (Don't laugh, I've done it.  Hooked my calculator up to my
wireless modem. :)  Theres only one other client that I'd consider using
(In fact, I'll have to admit, that I've been using more lately) and that
one can run natively on PC, UNIX and (More or less) Mac.  It's the only
one with a powerful enough scripting language, and without a complex
interface.  (It's scripting language is so powerful, it's written in it
- it uses Tcl/Tk :)

  I use both clients, and while I agree that TF has more raw power, zMUD
really isn't that far behind. Its biggest limitation is that it is a
windows-only client, so like others have mentioned you lose the ability to
have all your macros with you at any terminal. 
  There is one _big_ (IMO) reason that I use zmud over TF though...the
automapper. I know this isn't a huge fetaure for most people, but for me,
it is everything. Not that I'm asking for TF to implement an automapper,
but it is the reason I will choose zmud on a windows platform.
  The scripting language in TF is much more robust, but Zugg has recently
released an API kit, that allows plugins to be made for zMUD. At this time
I don't know how much this will affect things but it seemed pretty
powerful on the surface. I feel zMUD is also easier for the non-programmer
type (not that it is hard to use TF as a simple client, but when you want
nifty triggers it can get complex quickly). 
  I'd have to say try both. For Unix, TF wins hands down over tintin++.
But for windows, it really depends on what you are looking for. For me, it
is the automapper. Without that, I would TF only. To each their own, eh?
:)

i thought TF has a feature like that.  A feature that remembers the
directions you have gone, so that a macro can be easily made. 

Does the zMUD automapper do all 10 directions? (e,w,n,s,ne,nw,se,sw,u,d)

I use TF and gMUD.  Though gMUD lacks the power of tf, I use it when
coding nowadays because whenever I attempt to "paste" on TF for Windows,
it crashes the window.

Eh. That's the best answer I've seen so far.

In many cases, no one client wins out over another, it's more of a
matter of which client does the things you want more easily (for you).
Some folks like Zmud, some GMud, and still others prefer TF and tintin.
I actually prefer tf 99% of the time, and then 1% of the time when I'm
on
a 'prompted mud' e.g. a lp/diku/etc. style mud, I prefer zmud. :)

Oh, and yes, zmud supports all 10 or so (more actually) directions.  TF
has an automapper of some sort, although it's not graphical, and I can't
attest to how well it works, having never used it.

zMUD has that feature too.  I don't know if it does all 10 directions but it
certainly does the 6 standard ones.

Anyway, the automap feature keeps track of room information and exits so you'll
have an actual map of an area you're exploring.  Not just a path.  You can also
use the map by clicking on rooms and you'll be taken directly to that room along
a previously established path.  Note: I've never really used this feature as I
don't particularly use zMUD (should I say "TinyFugue rulez" here or will
everyone automatically disregard everything I say if I did that?) but that's how
I understand it.

I'd give a friend's eye teeth (I wouldn't give mine since I use them quite
frequently) to have an automapping feature in TinyFugue but I'm not going to
hold my breath.  It works well enough as it is for 99% of what I need.

  Oh...here is a point to ponder. TF is free. zMUD is $20 (one time fee).
That inherently makes TF better :) Again, I rationalize that I spent $20
for the mapper...it just happens to be attached to a client. Heh.

   Well, the zmud automapper isn't quite the same as the path-tracking
feature of TF. The zmud automapper is fully graphical, with a full grid
representation. It will track where you are, supports all directions (even
non-standard direction like 'enter', 'portal', etc.), and has several
methods of speedwalking so you can simply double-click on another room and
zzziiippp...you're there. This is only a quick overview of what it can do
(it has many other nifty features), and it is quite powerful and adapts
well to nearly any mud. I've used the mapper since the first beta version
and let me tell you it has come a LOOONG way. I suggest anyone interested
go grab v5.31 just to see it in action, even if you don't plan to switch
clients.

TF works with prompted muds.

I found that you need a -T"lp.mud" in the world definition.
On LP muds it works with prompts and when file scanning and receiving
the (More) prompt.

I'm aware of the -T options in regards to prompted muds in TF, I've just
never really liked using TF on a prompted mud.  Offends my sense of
tidiness somehow.  Fortunately, I'm rarely on systems/muds that are 
prompted, so it's usually not a problem for  me. :)

I was looking over the help for starting TF (/help tf) and I noticed
mention of the flag "-q" which enables a quiet login.

What exactly is a quiet login/how does it differ from a regular login? Does
the world load in the background or something?

I feel the same way about the /visual setting on TF.  I prefer to have
it off.  I find that it distracts me from data coming in as I type.
(which could mean your death in a PK setting).

I do like the CTRL-W, CTRL-U, CTRL-P, CTRL-N commands on TF though.
They are a life saver.  As well as the keyboard stack.

From /help quiet:

Help on: special variables: %quiet
  quiet=off 
          (flag) Gag text after login until the mud sends "Use the WHO 
          command", "### end of messages ###", or 25 lines.  Note: This
will 
          not function correctly on MUDs which don't send those strings
or 25 
          lines in the introductory text.  

For more complete information, see "special variables".
---
In other words, if you connect to a world with quiet set to on, or using
-q,
the first 25 lines or all lines until ### end of messages ### (whichever
comes
first) that the mud sends is gagged (e.g. you don't see them).  Combined
with
the automatic login features of tf, quiet nicely reduces the amount
stuff that
scrolls by when connecting to a world.

What a quiet login is the quelling of the mud login screen.
Most muds have some sort of design or ascii picture when you login.

the -q option will skip that so that there is less "spam" when logging
in.  I used it frequently back when I mudded on a 2400 baud modem.

If I define

/def -mregexp -abB -t"^(xyz) " t

and generate output "xyz asdf", TF bolds the line and creates a beep, like
it should. However if I do

/def -mregexp -P1bB -t"^(xyz) " t

and generate the same output, TF bolds the "xyz", but does not create a
beep.

This seems to have changed when I switched from libc5.x to glibc 2.0.7
(Redhat Linux 5.1). Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug (in TF or
termcap or something)? Oh, this happens both on TF 3.5b4 and 4.0a10.

Ok I still have the same original problem as the letter stated 2 before.
I for some reason cannot get my -T hook to work for this lp mud that asks
if I want color or not, it takes my name as an answer and my password as
my name.  Not only that it kicks my prompt under my /visual line.  I keep
this here for talks on my account.  How do I get it so it is like every
other mud?  And what do those control keys do?

Peace
-Mike

I want to gag a peice of text change what it is then display it to my
screen.

example say "There is a large wolf" I want to be able to change that
to "there is a large WOLF" also I want to change the word wolf to WOLF
matter where I see it.  Also if more than one word of 'wolf' is on a
line
I want to change all occurances of wolf to WOLF.  This is an example
of what I want to do.

Thanks, Kairo

I allmost got it, but with the following gag it takes out spaces or tabs

examples "        the wolf jumped" will get turned into "the wolf
jumped"
see I lose the spaces at the beggining.  Here is the gag
/def -ag -t'*wolf*' test2 = /replace wolf WOLF %*

So close :)

How seriously do we want an auto-mapper zMUD style.  It could easily be
implemented on Windows in a zMUD style GUI using a hook and an external
app (I have a module that I use for communicating with TF in my private
builds.)  Since I've been maintaining some TF for Win32 binaries, I'm
only releasing the vanilla versions, no extensions or modifications are
being included, but I use some heavy modifications to make it more
powerful in windows.  Specifically, providing an interface for some
Windows specific interprocess communication.  For those familiar with
Windows, I'm implementing TF as a DDE server where the world name is
the  DDE Server Name and the Connection allows command line execution
via a /send hook.  

In order to do an auto-mapper would require coding a quick mapper that
supports a communication method (DDE or OLE) and use macros that place
the command directional command lines (and the returned strings of the
command) to the mapper.  

I've used zMud, and only 2 words come to mind, EAccess Violation.  and
the mud that I spend most of my time on does things to break the mapper
by playing games with where the breaks from Description to Room Exits
split.

   I would be thrilled with an automapper in TF, but then again, I the big
automapper cheerleader for zMUD so maybe I'm biased. The only thing that
concerns me is 'coding a quick mapper'... it took Zugg over a year to get
the mapper working as well as it is now (it isn't an easy feat to get it
to conform to all varieties of muds out there). I don't really feel any
automapper could be made quickly and easily (if it were to approach the
power/configurability of zmud's), but I'm not the one that would be coding
it either.

  Yep...this was a large problem with some versions. zMud is up to
v5.31(beta) and is much better than all previous releases in terms of
access violations and memory management. Zugg is pretty good about fixing
them if you report them (and can tell him how to reproduce them). 
  Anyway, this is my vote for a plug-in TF automapper.

/help substitute

This loses all liting tho, unless you run in emulation=raw but I hear you
do that anyways.

From /help replace:

    /def -mregexp -t"TF" replace_tf = \
        /test substitute(replace("TF", "TinyFugue", {*}))

now change TF to wolf and TinyFugue to WOLF

Hello...

I have a slight problem with a set of macros I made for Makeing directions more noticable.

The Problem is I can't seem to get the partial highlight to get through...
Since I have to use -agG in the replace def It don't go through, how do I fix this?

Here is my macros:
/def -mregexp -agG -t"([a-zA-Z]+) leaves ([a-z]+)( |\.)" auto_leave_replace =\
        /replace %P2 $[toupper(%P2)] %*

/def -mregexp -agG -t"([a-zA-Z]+) arrives from (the |)([a-z]+)( |\.)" auto_arrive_replace\
= /replace %P2 $[toupper(%P2)] %*

/def -p100 -mregexp -F -P0hCyellow -t"(NORTH|SOUTH|WEST|EAST|UP|DOWN|ABOW|BELOW)"

Fast help apriciated :)

it partialy works as you can see the spaces or tabs before the (GLOWING)

/substitute kills hilites.  In addition, you don't need to gag it, that
just gets killed too.  Try this instead:

/def -mregexp -t"([a-zA-Z]+) -P500 -G  leaves ([a-z]+)( |\.)" \
        auto_leave_replace = /replace %P2 $[toupper(%P2)] %*

Why not write the auto mapper as a separate tcl/tk program that listens on
a socket... Then tf, regardless of version or internal hackery, could just
open a world to it and send commands to it from a set of triggers.

Alternatively, now that there's tfio, named pipes shouldn't be hard to do
using /sh mkfifo to create them. Well, that about covers my knowledge of
ipc, but what do you guys think? :)

From my understanding, although this may be wrong, the * variable doesn't
honor leading spaces. So Naked's suggestion in function form is what you
want:

/def -mregexp -t"Glowing" test2 = \
  /test substitute(strcat({PL},"GLOWING",{PR}))

Of course it could be a problem with /replace, I dunno.

I wouldn't mind seeing a Tcl/Tk mapper.  But thats partly because then I
could swipe it and make it into a package for the Tcl/Tk client I use. :)
I rarely use tf these days unless I'm in a text only environment.

The following does exactly what I been trying to do.  is Strcat the

to append strings together ?  Learning to program in TF is a PAIN.

Thanks, it works perfect now.

I like to know why i had to make these with -F, I kinda understand
whats going on but not completly.  All I know is that I can use raw mode

and have correct ansi.  So I wont have color bleeding anymore.
My guess is if that 3 different color codes get triggered that the first

one will fix the text and then that text gets passed on to the 2nd
trigger
to fix additonal stuff and so on and till I see what comes on the screen
?

Hi,

I'm playing a Chinese MUD with 8-bit codes. I found that sometimes 
escape key in standard ansi color codes(e.g. ^[[2;37;0m) just 
dissappeared, it becomes [2;37;0m instead. anyone knows what's going on?

Tony

There are several reasons for this kind of behaviour, the most important
being just plain simple lag. Any ANSII code, according to the standard,
has to be transmitted within a certain timespan. So if it doesn't get
transmitted within say 2 seconds, it'll be treated as a normal character
string, and will be sent to your terminal as that same character string.
Since your terminal doesn't know what to do with <ESC>[ codes, it'll just
display it as it gets it.

That's one reason. Another reason could be a slight fault in your xterm
(if you're using that), which basically causes it to print ANSII sequences
that are unknown to the Xterm itself, instead of just gagging them.

I don't know what is your problem, but if you have a very 'stuttery'
connection to the mud you play, it might very well be a lag problem.
(Though I am not entirely sure if TF actually honours the standards
considering ANSII codes..)

Mad.

I don't think it becauses of the two reasons. My locale is en_US and I'm 
using ansi_attr for emulation so tf is supposed to handle the ansi color 
codes. I tried the raw mode and it's cut off, too.

I found that the escape key most likely disappeared when the code before 
it is \300 up(e.g. \326, \374). I think it maybe because of the setting 
of locale and emulation. anyone experts of the two settings?

the NT version of Tinyfugue, is there anyway to make it so it doesn't
drop your
connection everytime there is a little lag.  Its extreamly annoying, and
when I used
to use TF on a shellaccount I would have to lag for like 10 minutes
before getting
dropped.

I modified /tickon to cut down on spam if I idle, thought I would post it
in case anyone else found it useful, also to see if anyone thought it would
cause problems (other than turning itself off and when you are idling while
regenning).

Greetings all.
  Been reading all the helps, and browsing my saved tf mails, but
can't find the answer.

I'm trying to parse the output from a command on the mud.  I've got
most of the stuff done, but I'm running into trouble with the very
start of the output.

The output is one line, and the part thats causing trouble can look
like:

[ 12  0] 
[ 12 -13]
[100  0]
[100 -13]

I don't need to do anything with this yet, but I'd like to later down
the road.  The main part that is tripping me is the []s and the fact
that I can either have a space or a number after the first [.

Is there any single regexp/glob that can handle that format?

Thanks..

/def -mregexp -t'^\[ *-?[0-9]+ -?[0-9]+\]' num_match

	You want the space-star for the case where you have
[  1  0], since it seems to be left justifying the numbers to a
particular column.  If you want to capture the numbers, just put
()'s around then:

/def -mregexp -t'^\[ *(-?[0-9]+) (-?[0-9]+)\]' num_match

	Then use P1 and P2.  I also put in the dash-question before 
the first number, to account for that being negative as well.

Thanks muchly.. perhaps I should go get the book on regexps :>  Will

Was wondering if anyone had suggestions as to what is good macro
programming style in tf. What is a good way to name hooks, triggers, binds
and commands? whatever_trig or t_whatever? Also, is this a good
approximation to piping something to /dev/null:

/command %| /test {?}

thanks,
Raf

These are very solid regexps, but I think they allow one case to get by:

	[ 12  0]

Was mentioned in the original list of possibilities, and there are two 
spaces in the middle.  These regexps won't match that.  A simple addendum 
needs to be made so here goes (cross my fingers and hope this is right).

/def -mregexp -t'^\[ *-?[0-9]+ *-?[0-9]+\]' num_match

When I connected to somewhere with autologin, sometimes it halts at the password
prompt, waiting for me to enter my password. I suppose I could fix this with a
PROMPT hook, but that is not the reason for this post. The problem is that when
it is waiting for me to enter my password, and my input is not echoed to the
screen, I can't put things in the keyboard buffer (ESC-down).

Just read some mails about zMUD's superior automapping function, and me

shouldn't be mudding! (Lazy bunch.. ;)

A graphical automapper can be handy in creating webpages (if they can be
saved as a graphics file).  It's a nice tool for coders.

As a player, I don't think I'd ever use one.  It doesn't take long to
memorize if you are playing a mud frequently.

Oh, I'm a common mortal human and "MorgenGrauen" (a German MUD) is a world
with over 17'000 rooms. I enjoy real life too much to spend as much time
as I would need to know every way, every step without any notes. I guess
that a really good automapper is nothing to be thrown away easily, if you
don't use a nice set of path-macros or a breath search way system.

Yepyep...that's what notebook, graph paper and a nice supply of 0.5mm
lead
is for.  (Or in my case, paper, 0.5mm lead, pencils and pens of various
colors, and a nicely typeset hardcopy of the latest system programming
manual pages, but I'm one of the more insane ones :) )

I am new to TF and would rank myself as a poor programmer to boot.

TF seems to be fairly easy to work with, but I am having trouble
getting a simple counter to work. Actually I get a session counter
to work fine. I just cant get TF to save totals from one session to
another.

I want a total kills counter that is triggered on "You recieve you share of
experience*". Hopefully, it works as a total kills counter for the life of
a mud character.

So far I have tried shelling/writing to a *.tf and saving it, then
loading it again.. seems pretty complicated and doesnt work.

Any hints examples would be appreciated!

Thanks

Gary

  I'm still kinda new to TF and consider myself to be a fairly good

  Type "/help tfio" while in TF. <eg> No, really, I was kinda curious
about this as well since I was thinking about writing an automapper for a
PK mud I play on (sometimes I need the ability to immediately flee to a
safe location no matter where I happen to be and the current mapping
routines just don't cut it...) so obviously I'll need to be able to handle
file i/o as well. Anyway, enough blather, here's what I came up with for
ya.

  The following macro will save the value stored in the "counter" variable
to a file named "file" overwriting any previous value that "file" may have
contained in the process.

/def counter_save = \
   /test sid:=tfopen("file", "w")%; \
   /test tfwrite(sid, counter)%; \
   /test tfclose(sid)

  And this macro will load the value stored in "file" into the "counter"
variable.

/def counter_load = \
   /test sid:=tfopen("file", "r")%; \
   /test tfread(sid, counter)%; \
   /test tfclose(sid)

HTH. HAND.

That works.  Or, you could take advantage of the more convenient interface
of the textutil.tf library:

  /def counter_save = /listvar counter %| /writefile file
  /def counter_load = /load file

   What makes a person who uses graph paper any less 'lazy' than one who
uses the automapper? The person using paper sure as heck spends a lot more
time, sure, but that doesn't make them superior. The mapper is just a tool
the same way pencil and paper are, you just have less mess by avoiding
eraser smears and rearranging rooms is easier should they 'run into' each
other. As someone else pointed out, once you have things mapped, you also
have it pretty well memorized and tend to rely on the map less and less
anyway.

I myself have never drawn maps and have never give zMuds automapper any long term use (i generally use Unix terminals/sun workstations to mud from). I would however say from experience of playing on a large mud, people using zMud very often get "spammed out" during big group battles or long speedwalks. I even know of one person who has to run so many triggers that it lags his p266 to the point where he cant type manual input without a 1 minute delay (could just be a lot of pointless trigs though <g>) . I have never been spammed out using TF and I think that is a major strong point of the program, stability.

Oh and one little dumb question, what on earth are tcl/tk clients?

Cheers

   Hahah, yes it is possible to have enough triggers in zMud to slow
things down. However, if he has enough running to slow a p266 to a crawl,
I'd be tempted to think he's more interested in botting than playing. I've
yet to find a need for _that_ many triggers if I plan on sitting at the
keyboard myself.

Any mud worth its salt won't make "graph-paper" style mapping possible 
anyway.  Its vastly superior for the story and game of it all to have 
less "mechanic" ways of doing things.

I mean seriously, if you can have your client walk the same path and 
pre-program to fight all the monsters based on some silly formula... 
what's the point of playing at all?

   I'm curious what other kind of mapping exists, beyond the annoying
'random maze' style. Better yet, point me to a mud with it. The only
deviation from "graph-paper" style mapping is hex-based mapping used on
DartMud and Legacy, but it just requires different paper... :)

1. Whether or not automapping is a "good thing" or not is of course up
to everyone to decide for themself. Personally, I wouldn't reject the
concept too easily... I mean, if you're so afraid of using the
capabilities of a computer to help you, why the heck do you use tf
at all and not a simpler client (under most systems I've run into
there's a perfectly good one called 'telnet'). Having said this I just
want to say that personally I think automappers suck, but not for some
silly  
I-don't-use-'em-cos-I-wanna-show-off-that-I'm-a-really-macho-mud-nerd
reason but cos I think they cause more trouble than they help me
avoid :)

2. I'm having problems setting up keybindings. I've recently switched
to TF from powwow (a newer version of cancan, if that means anything
to you) and under powwow it was _very_ easy to bind the numeric
keypad. Very handy if you bound it to the usual directions (8 - north,
9 - northeast, 6 - east etc). I'm having problems with this in tf
though. I can't manage to get the keybindings working at the
_same_time_ as the arrow keys work as normal _and_ the normal number
keys work as normal. Have anyone solved this problem?

Where you map a hallway as a single room instead of making it longer or 
shorter to match other instinces of parallel rooms.

It could be termed 'conceptual' mapping.  Most muds do it half-way (like 
a building-front only takes one city room and a city only takes one 
geographic map room).  I prefer when the whole of the mapping is based on 
this...  otherwise its just a big maze.  You have ot imagine where things 
are conceptually... it makes the game more of a story and less of a video 
game.

It can not be done.  From /help keys:

  Because TF runs in a terminal and not in a windowing system, it does
  not see the key itself, but only the characters generated by a key.
  If two different keys generate the same characters, TF can not tell
  them apart.  For example, on most keyboards, with Num Lock on, the
  numeric keypad generates numbers, which can not be distinguished from
  the numbers generated by keys above the letter keys; and with Num
  Lock off, the numeric keypad generates codes that can not be
  distinguished from the codes generated by the arrow keys.  So on most

Actually there are a number of solutions to this. Ofcourse none of them
are generally acceptable. Depending on where we are, we can rebind the
numeric keypad to different key sequences which then can be bound in tf.
If we are using a console, we can usually make a new keymap and load it,
to get different bindings for numeric keypad. If we are using X, we can
usually do the rebinding there too... simplest way would be to just use
Xmodmap to redefine those to function keys forexample. A second and more
elaborate option would be to use the xkb extension of some X servers and
redefine the keys there. In there we can really affect the behavior of the
keys and make cool bindings like change only the numlock operation of
those keys. And finally, if we are using Xterm or some other program with
the vt100 widget, we can rebind the keys to (for example) function keys by
using translations... and we can even have it so that pressing F1 changes
between normal numpad and our own version. The xterm receives raw keyboard
events so we can do this. I have F1 bound to switching between normal and
dvorak keymaps and F2 swaps the backspace and delete for emacs.

But, none of these solutions are simple or elegant.

I have devised a new kind of input mode for tinyfugue, which has command
mode and input mode separate, just like vi, so you can bind movement and 
others to the main keyboard and still be able to type. It is however hard
to learn and a bit elaborate, so I wouldn't suggest to anyone but someone
with the utmost need.

From personal use, a simple rescue script, trying to rescue players in a group of 30 or so lags zMud so much that you _have_ to write extra triggers as your keyboard response speed drops becomes too slow to be effective. I've used TF with full rescues and other trigs on my Uni. comp. Soc. server while 20 others have been on  (its an old 486dx2 66) without any diminished performance. The fact you can run TF on a system that zMuds self extractor would be likely to hang on speaks for itself.

Maybe something like this:

/def -E'!kbpoint() & !kbtail()' -B'up' north_bind = n
/def -E'!kbpoint() & !kbtail()' -B'Right' east_bind = e
...


Assuming -B'up' and such work with your term.

 I might be running an ancient tf (3.5 beta 4), but I've never noticed
a -E flag to the /def command...

Sorry, that wouldn't work anyway...but the idea works. If your number pad
generates numbers with numlock on, you could do something like this:

/def -b'8' north_bind = \
  /if (!kbpoint() & (kbtail() =~ "")) \
    n%;\
  /else \
    /input 8%;\
  /endif
...

This assumes that you will not have any commands the first character of
which is a number, but the numbers will work normally otherwise.

[several X-specific solutions omitted]

The original problem will no longer exist on many terminals in version
40a11.  That version will put the keypad in "application" mode, which
on at least some terminals will make the keypad keys transmit a unique
character sequence instead of a digit character (if Num Lock is on).
For example, on an xterm with the keypad in application mode, a shifted
or numlocked keypad-8 transmits "^[Ox", which is different than the
up-arrow sequence "^[OA".  Whether this will work for you depends on
your terminal emulator.

This will probably be the last version before 4.0 beta.

Changes:

4.0 alpha 11 (7/22/1998)
------------
Added "%@" conversion to and removed length restriction from ftime().
Added -i option to /fgrep and /egrep.
Improved precision of process timing.
/def -E interprets enumerated special variables as integers, not strings.
Skips signal handling confirmation prompts when input is not a terminal.
Disabled OS/2 hostname resolution error messages, which apparently do not
  work on all versions of OS/2. (40a9)
Added codes for named keys when using HARDCODE terminal codes.
Numeric keypad keys now generate unique character sequences on more terminals
  (this may break some existing keypad usage).
Fixed codes for named arrow keys on some terminals (vt100 in particular).
Fixed "color bleeding", where mid-line server attributes were sometimes
  applied to the beginning of a line if lp=on.
Fixed handling of interrupted server attribute code with lp=on.
Fixed bugs involving unset {k,m,q}prefix.
Fixed autologin and localecho problems on some telnet worlds.
Fixed overflow in floating point significant figures.
Fixed potentially fatal error in failed nonblocking hostname resolution.
Fixed /tee in textutil.tf.

  Sorry if this is a stupid question but I was wondering if there was a
precompiled Windows version of tf available? I seem to recall something
like that being discussed a week or so ago but didn't really pay much
attention at the time since I'm an OS/2 user and have no need of a Windows
port. However, last night while I was mudding another participant said he
was sick of zmud and wanted to try another client so of course I suggested
tf but he was only able to find the source which he couldn't use so I told
him I'd ask about it on here. Any help is appreciated. TIA

OK gang.  It's official, the TinyFugue for Windows precompiled has packed up
and moved.

The new and permanent address is now http://www.druware.com/tf and will
house my TF information and binaries from here on out.

You will find both a "stock" build, and a slightly modified build here, both
with source available.  The only change that is implemented in the modified
build is the addition of a command for executing external Windows
applications.  The command is /winexec "file to execute"  and can take any
file, including a .wav file and will do whatever windows would do with it
should you double click it or type it in the "Run" command.

Good lick and have fun mudding

Andy

Is it possible to define the logfile so that I can add the date to the filename?
So the output will be to "tiny.log.thisdate"

something like:

/def beginlog = \
  /let logname=$[strcat("tiny.log.",ftime("%d_%m_%y",time()))]%;\
  /log %{*} %{logname}

/def endlog = \
  /log off

I recommend reversing the order of the date components ("%Y_%m_%d"), so they
sort nicely when you list your files.  And using %Y instead of %y - the
year 2000 is just around the corner!

Since whoever posted those hotkeys that use pageup and pagedown to
scrollback
that has made life a lot easier.  But this is to kenkeys,  you have
anyplans of
making a built-in scroll back.  Basically you would type something like
F6 function
key or something else this would enter in scrollback mode, since
scrollregeion is
supported in cygwin32 19.1 now this will work under windows as well.

Then you can just use PGUP or PGDOWN or UP or DOWN to go up by a page
or up by a line, this would rock hard.  Also while in scrollback you of
course
buffer all input coming from the mud till you exit the scroll back.
Doing this should be possible using VT100 escape codes I would think.

Well just an idea to suggest on.

Hi folks,

I've got a problem with adding date and time to my comms log for a mud I play. Although it works fine, I think its very inefficient:

/set timedate=%d/%m/%Y %H:%M
/def dtime = /@test echo(ftime({*-%%{timedate}}, time())), time()

/set tell_file=~/tf/LOGS/tells
/def -Fq -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ tells you \'(.*[^\'])\'$' log_tells=\
  /set dtime=$(/dtime)%;/test fwrite(tell_file, strcat( {dtime}, " ", {1}, " told you: ", {P1}))
/def -Fq -mregexp -t'^\(tell\)[^ ]+ (.*[^\'])$' log_tells1=\
  /set dtime=$(/dtime)%;/test fwrite(tell_file, strcat( {dtime}, " ", {1}, " ", {P1}))

/set gos_file=~/tf/LOGS/goss
/def -Fq -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ gossips, \'(.*[^\'])\'$' log_goss=\
  /set dtime=$(/dtime)%;/test fwrite(gos_file, strcat( {dtime}, " ",{1}, " gossip: ", {P1}))
/def -Fq -mregexp -t'^\(gossip\) ([^ ]+) (.*[^\'])$' log_goss2=\
  /set dtime=$(/dtime)%;/test fwrite(gos_file, strcat( {dtime}, " ", "(gossip) ", {P1}, " ", {P2}))

/set gp_file=~/tf/LOGS/group
/def -Fq -mregexp -t'^[^ ]+ tells the group, \'(.*[^\'])\'$' log_group=\
  /set dtime=$(/dtime)%;/test fwrite(gp_file, strcat( {dtime}," ",{1}, " told the group: ", {P1}))
/def -Fq -mregexp -t'^\(group\)[^ ]+ (.*[^\'])$' log_group1=\
  /set dtime=$(/dtime)%;/test fwrite(gp_file, strcat( {dtime}," ", {1}, " ", {P1}))

/set info_file=~/tf/LOGS/infos
/def -Fq -mregexp -t'^\[INFO\] (.*[^\'])$' log_info=\
  /set dtime=$(/dtime)%;/test fwrite(info_file, strcat( {dtime}," ","INFO: ", {P1}))


I tried using $(/dtime) as an element in the strcat instead of {dtime} but it wouldn't work properly.
Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Cheers,

Rowan

hi,

I have compiled the new version and some problems with the login
I stored following line in my .tfrc file and it works before.

addworld -T"telnet" Avalon charname password  avalon.mud.de 7777

But now the login dont use the charname and password and stops
at the char question.

I read the new help to addworld but it dont the works.

>4.0 beta 1 (7/27/1998)

I'm still running 4.0 alpha 4, is there a bug that's been fixed or perhaps a
limitation in tf in general that would cause it to shut down after several days
of being constantly connected?  Let me explain how I run it.  I have it running
in a "screen" session on my shell account at my ISP.  I telnet into the shell
and attach/detach from the screen session, so tf is always running, even when
I'm not connected.  After a few days, sometimes over a week, I'll connect and
the session has shut down for some reason.  No core dump or anything to explain
it.  Any ideas?  Does it maybe run out of some resource over time?  Btw, I'm a
high level imm on a mud, so I use it to monitor what goes on, its very handy
with a large buffer to recall from.

Secondly, what would be the best way to preserve my history buffer from session
to session?  If it does shut down for some reason, how could I restore the
buffer, preferably with all the color (doubt this is possible) intact?

Thanks,
Ron

I do not remember where I forst saw this, but I have the following in
my .tfrc to recall the input buffer:

;; Logging of input history, a little like .bash_history
/sys tail -n 1000 < /home/mpc/Personal/tf-logs/input.log >
/home/mpc/.tf/.ih
/quote -dexec -S /recordline -i '/home/mpc/.tf/.ih
/sys rm /home/mpc/.tf/.ih

;; Log input stuff
/log -i /home/mpc/Personal/tf-logs/input.log


I imagine using /recordline with appropriate options can load a
specific world's history in a similar fashion.

Cheers,

Mark

Someone asked for a mechanism to save and load histories, so here's
a way to do it.  Attributes are lost unfortunately, but timestamps
are saved.

This can be publically posted, as long as the comments remain intact, and
I am informed where it is displayed.


;; histories.tf - Save and load histories
;; by Karen Etheridge, ether@tcp.com
;; based on storehist.tf by David Moore (oj@egbt.org)
;; and feedback from Ken Keys (hawkeye@tcp.com)

;; Needs at least version 4.0a9.

/require lisp.tf
/loaded histories.tf

;; In this file:
;; /save_histories - save all global, input, world histories
;; /load_histories - restore all previously saved histories
;; /save_history - save a global, input, or world history
;; /load_history - load a global, input, or world history

;; /save_ and /load_histories require a connect hook (commented out at bottom
;; of file) to set %all_worlds, and a hist/ directory.

;; Warning: loading histories into TF will result in any previously-existing
;; history lines of later timestamps to be lost/unreachable by /recall.
;; Therefore, load histories before opening any worlds.

I think it is the Bash shell, though Tcsh is capable of it also, that can use
a .history file in the homedir as a recall buffer rather than memory. While
it takes up more space on the disk, it has the advantage of being consistent
no matter when you log out. Could maybe Tf, in the next alpha series, offer
a similar option, of writing all the history stuff into the appropriate files,
perhaps in the .tfhistory directory, and have TF reload them at startup?

This wasn't documented, but world type "telnet" now requires "login:"
and "password:" prompts.  Avalon isn't a telnet world and doesn't send
those prompts, so you should use type "lp".

That final time() isn't needed.  (/time only does it to set the return value,
which you aren't using.)  You can also eliminate %timedate.

  /def dtime = /@test echo(ftime("%%d/%%m/%%Y %%H:%%M", time()))

Use $$(/dtime).  The evaluation of log_tells changes that to $(/dtime),
which then does the desired thing in the /test expression.

Or even better, change dtime to a function by getting rid of the echo,
and use dtime() intead of $$(/dtime):

  /def dtime = /@test ftime("%%d/%%m/%%Y %%H:%%M", time())

More importantly, you can use tfwrite(tell_handle, ...) instead of
fwrite(tell_file, ...).  Before you start, do:

  /set tell_handle=$[tfopen("~/tf/LOGS/tells", "a")]

The process may have reached your ulimit for cpu time or some other resource.
Use the "limit" or "ulimit" command in the shell to view or change it.

That's right ladies and gents.  I've got the self-installer rebuilt and ready to go.  This version does not include 
any of my Extras.  For the extras you will have to wait until I get a free hour or so to apply the patches and 
rebuild it.  As usual, source for both will be available from the Website.

Enjoy!

 Some commands in textutil.tf are obviously not meant to be used
without the %| pipe, for ex /grep, /fmt, /uniq, /tee. Typing one
of those commands while having stdin as tfin renders the current
tf-session unusable. This behaviour is quite 'unfriendly', maybe
 some kind of warning or denial of service would be appropriate?

I agree that it's not very friendly, and I may do something about it.
But it doesn't make the session unusable:  you can always interrupt the
macro with SIGINT (^C).

This is just a status report but if any of you had an interest I thought I would let you know.

I now have TF 4.0 beta 1 compiled under BeOS and working to a point.  In about another week or so I should 
have it complete enough to begin informal testing of it.  This is a difficult port as BeOS doesn't support 
select against file descriptors, I have however worked around that and have a 90% effective solution in 
place.  As soon as I resolve a couple of last blocking issues, this should be ready for release.  I will 
be looking for a couple of Be users to help me test this in a couple of weeks and if all goes well I will 
submit my minor changes to Ken for approval and inclusion into the mainline code.

Hi folks,

I use the following trigger to gag out the prompt on a mud I play. The problem is it also gags anything that comes after the prompt.

/def -wbb -F -ag -q -t -mregexp -t'^([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)H( | -)([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)M ([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)V >' prt= \
/set chp=%P1%;/set cma=%P3%P4%;/set cmo=%P6%;\
/set mhp=%P2%;/set mma=%P5%;/set mmo=%P7%;\
/if (%{chp} < %{recallhps} & recalled=1) \
		/if (%{cma} < 50) home%;\
		/else rl%; \
		/endif%; /set xsdamage=1%; /set recalled=0%; \
		/endif%; \
/if (cma < 1 & nomana!=0) gtf , &+Rhas no &+GMANA!%; /set nomana=0%; /endif

I tried adding a /substitute {PR} at the end of the macro and adding a [^$]* to the end of the pattern.

/def -wbb -F -q -t -mregexp -t'^([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)H( | -)([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)M ([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)V > [^$]*' prt= \
/set chp=%P1%;/set cma=%P3%P4%;/set cmo=%P6%;\
/set mhp=%P2%;/set mma=%P5%;/set mmo=%P7%;\
/if (%{chp} < %{recallhps} & recalled=1) \
		/if (%{cma} < 50) home%;\
		/else rl%; \
		/endif%; /set xsdamage=1%; /set recalled=0%; \
		/endif%; \
/if (cma < 1 & nomana!=0) gtf , &+Rhas no &+GMANA!%; /set nomana=0%; /endif%;\
/substitute {PR}

This works except when there is nothing after a prompt (just a line feed) where it adds extra blank lines to the output.

Also is there any way to preserve the colour from the original text as this is lost when using /substitute.

Cheers for any help,

Rowan

Hmmm..

How hard would it be to let /load return a value? I'm thinking about 0 for
failed and the full file name of the file loaded if succeeded. Something
like that..

Mad.

/Load always has returned a consistent value, although it wasn't documented.
It will be documented in 4.0 beta 2, and you may rely on it now:

  /Load and /require return 1 if successful (for /require, this
  includes not needing to read the file), or 0 if not successful.

Returning the filename would be ambiguous (what if you tried to load a
file named "0"?) and unnecessary (you already know it, since you passed
it as an argument).  Besides, the LOADFAIL hook provides the filename
in %{1} and the reason for failure in %{-1}.

The only useful functional change is tfclose("o"), which is an efficient
way to prevent further output from a macro.  For example,

  /def -i ismacro = /test tfclose("o")%; /list -s -i %{*-@}

instead of the old hack

  /def -i ismacro = /list -s -i %{*-@} %| /test {?}

Other than that, the only changes are installation fixes for lame
platforms and some minor documentation improvements.

4.0 beta 2 (8/6/1998)
----------
Documented new "telnet" login handling.  See /help addworld.
Fixed tfclose() of tfin/tfout; closing tfout prevents output in a macro body.
Fixed compilation on systems (SunOS 4.1.4) without a putchar function. (40b1)
Fixed compile error in expand.c under non-ansi compilers. (40a5)
Fixed build problem in some versions of make. (40a11)

Hi all,

I want to set a trigger that as soon as a creature in a room tells me
to pay a certain amount of money/coins, TF will automaticly respond
and pay that number of coins.  The amount of coins are randomly
generated, and thus not always the same.

The MUD text is as follows, and I quote:
>The swordsman blocks you with his sword.  'You're not going anywhere
>until you pay me 27 coins,' the swordsman says.

I'll normally respond with 'pay 27' but I'd like the trigger to do
this automaticly.

All help would be appreciated :)

Thanks in advance,
-SandMan

I use regexp's because I find globs get a tad annoying.

/def -mregexp -t'The swordsman blocks you with his sword\.  \'You\'re not going anywhere until you pay me ([^ ]*) coins,\' the swordsman says\.' payhim=pay 27

Hmm, DUH! Friday afternoon and my brain aint working, should have been as follows:
/def -mregexp -t'The swordsman blocks you with his sword\.  \'You\'re not going anywhere until you pay me ([^ ]*) coins,\' the swordsman says\.' payhim=pay %{P1}

Hoi, i have some problems with variable substitution.

I wanna do the following regmatches:

/if ($[regmatch("(YY|XX|VV)",tmp)]) /echo %tmp%;/endif
/if ($[regmatch("(AA|SS|FF)",tmp)]) /echo %tmp%;/endif
/if ($[regmatch("(WW|EE|GG)",tmp)]) /echo %tmp%;/endif

No Prob so far, but now i wanna store the regexp to match in a variable:

/set grnpfl=YY|XX|VV or /set yelpfl="(AA|SS|FF)" or /set redpfl=(WW|EE|GG)

What is the best way, and how looks like the regmatch call then ?

/if ($[regmatch("(%grnpfl)",tmp)]) /echo %tmp%;/endif  ???


Thanks, Michael

/help regmatch
...
Subexpressions can later be extracted using the Pn variables or 
%Pn substitutions.
...

So your code fragment would look like
/let grnpfl=(AA|SS|FF) %;\
/if ($[regmatch(grnpfl, tmp)]) /echo %{P1} %; /endif

Hello,

I try to do the following:

/def -p1 -mregexp -aBCyellow -t'^(He|She|It) is almost mashed to a puddle of$' =
\
    /def -n1 -p1 -mregexp -aBCyellow -t'^blood\.$'

Which should highlight the line "He is almost mashed to a puddle of" and then
the same should happen for the next line which just contains the word "blood."

The trigger gets triggered properly and the first line gets highlighted ("... is
almost mashed ...") but the /def within the trigger seems not to work.

I get:

% macro not defined: '
% def: unmatched ' in t option

Anybody knows what that means? The ' definitely *is* terminated.

Thanks for your hints.

Harry

PS: I use TinyFugue version 4.0 beta 2.

Using regexp trigs inside an extra evaluation layer is tricky, you have to
escape the $ and such. In this case a simple match trigger will work and
you don't have to escape anything. Also, always name your macros. So try
this:

/def -p1 -mregexp -aBCyellow -t'^(He|She|It) is almost mashed to a puddle
of$' condition_trig = \
  /def -n1 -p1 -msimple -aBCyellow -t'blood.'

I've been pondering lately what would the best way to display the tick.tf
info to the status bar. Couple of the ideas were to just leave the status
bar area blank until the 10 second timer, then put something like 10sec in
it, and then TICK for a second or two at the time (or leave the TICK info
in the regular text flow. The other idea was to have a counter that counted
down the seconds until
the next tick. I think this idea would be the coolest way of displaying it, and
also the most immediately apparent...but I wonder a) how efficient this
would be, and b) how it would look w/ the status bar always flickering.
Also I'm not
sure what the best way to code this would be.

Any suggestions, idea or code wise?

 Hi gurus!

 This is probably a very simple problem, and in fact it hasn't got that
much to do with TF, but as my problem is in TF, I'll put it in here
anyway. :)

 What I want to do is change all the spaces in a variable to underscores
("_"), so as to change "this is just a test" into "this_is_just_a_test".

 Nice and simple, but I'm too tired at the moment to figure out what
function(s) to use, so I'll just go to sleep and let you guys worry about
that ;)

I believe this is the nicest solution using bundled functions..

/require tr.tf

tr(" ", "_", "this is just a test")

will yield
this_is_just_a_test

The command must be run in expression context - e.g. with a /test or
inside a $[] or /if (..)

See: /help expressions, /help tr

I'd be more interested in seeing someone write up a buncha stuff so tf
supports MCP.  Pueblo is dead.

I've written MCP 1.x and 2.1 support, each with a local editing package
that supports Xwindows and screen background editing.  The MCP 1.x stuff
is a bit broken due to changes in TF.  Find me online if you want to play
with the 2.x code...

Yes, Pueblo is dead, and an Xtf (or a front-end that uses the TF engine)
would be nice.  However, I'd like to make use of the dead client's
extensions with Linux if possible.  But if nothing has been done with it,
that's a good reason why Pueblo died. ;)

I've got a little function that does something more than that, but also
works pretty well for you :)

It's an adaptation of 'tr' which allows you to change more characters to
another one than just one, or part of a string.

;;; strallsubchr(string change_from, char change_to, string str)

/def strallsubchr = \
    /let old=%;\
    /let new=%;\
    /let left=%;\
    /let right=%;\
    /test old:={1}%;\
    /test new:={2}%;\
    /test right:={-2}%;\
    /while /let i=$[strchr(right, old)]%; /@test i >= 0%; /do \
      /@test left := strcat(left, substr(right, 0, i), new)%;\
      /@test right := substr(right, i + 1)%;\
    /done%;\
    /return strcat(left, right)

Usage is something like: 
strallsubchr(" /.!","_","some/string with/thingies.!")
Resulting in: some_string_with_thingies__

Anyway. It's probably inefficient and all :) But I needed a quick hack to
transform filenames to something that could be used as a variable name.

Mad.

I think someone was working on a GTK/Gnome frontend to TF... I'll look
around for urls etc.

Hello,

I'd like to have a trigger which is like:

Trigger it if it contains "abc" but does NOT start with "Party". The normal
"contain" part is easy but I have no idea how to do the "not" part.

Any ideas?

Harry

There is no way of (easily) doing nots in regular expressions.

Here are some options:

1. -t'^[^P][^a][^r][^t][^y].*abc' ...
  caveats:  does not match if "abc" is in the first five characters.

2. -t'abc' -E'!regmatch("^Party", {*})' ...
  caveats: WILL NOT WORK! Listed here just so you don't try it.
           (The %*, %n, %Pn variables haven't been defined yet.)

3. -t'abc' macro_name=\
  /if (regmatch("^Party", {*})) /break %; /endif %;\
  <body here>
  caveats: Any highlights will come into affect whether or not "Party" is
    in the string.

4. -p101 -t'^Party' ... (make sure not -F)
   -p100 -t'abc' ...
  caveats: Highlighting will be better than in #4, but you need to choose
    the trigger priorities (and fall-through flags) carefully, so you don't
    block any other triggers or highlights that you don't want to.

It's worse than that.  It also will fail to match "Porky abc", "Bar foo abc",
etc.  (For the logically inclined, the error above was in the application of
DeMorgan's Law.)

Good call.

If the trigger has no attributes, this is the way to go.  If it does, you
can take them out of the trigger and apply them with /substitute after the
test:

  3a. /def ... -t'abc' macro_name=\
         /if (regmatch("^Party", {*})) /break %; /endif %;\
         /substitute -a<attrs> %*%;\
         <body here>

As stated, #4's Party trigger may interfere with other triggers.  Since
solution #3a doesn't have the attribute problem, I recommend #3a over #4.

I am using colour in TF on several words, actually an awful lot of words.
All enemies are red, all immorts yellow, all friends green and so on.
But... after I got a unix account at school, compiled tf version TF 4.0
beta 2, and copied in my old .tfrc and the file with the defs, I don't get
colour from these defs.  I get colour from the mud, so it is not a
terminal emulation problem.
As an example of the lines here is one:

/def -p1 -F -P0Cgreen -mregexp -t'[mM]istress'

That would in the old tf on the other account produce a green word
Mistress or mistress and continue with the looking so several words on
each line could have different colours.

Here I get none, whatsoever.

Please I want some help, if someone out there know the solution, please
mail me or post the solution on the mailing list.

Thanks on beforehand, 
Morten-Christian Bernson

Hello,

I wonder wether it is faster to use several triggers like

/def -p1 -mregexp -aBCblue -t'^\[INFO\]: (.*) abc ' = ...
/def -p1 -mregexp -aBCblue -t'^\[INFO\]: (.*) def ' = ...
/def -p1 -mregexp -aBCblue -t'^\[INFO\]: (.*) ghi ' = ...

or just one which looks like

/def -p1 -mregexp -aBCblue -t'^\[INFO\]: (.*) (abc|def|ghi) ' = ...

Is there a number of lines where one gets faster than the other or is the
combined version using (..|..|..) always faster/slower ?

What do you think about it ?

Harry

The only real test is to try them all and time them, which I haven't done.
But I can offer some theory.

I'll assume that lines beginning with "[INFO]: " make up a relatively
small fraction of the lines received.  So, the best thing you can do
for performance is to make the other lines get rejected as efficiently
as possible.  Most lines will get rejected before the comparison
reaches the expensive ".*" part.  If you have 3 separate triggers, then
most lines will get tested against "^\[INFO\]: " and rejected 3 times;
if you have 1 trigger with alternation, those lines must only be
tested/rejected once.  So 1 alternation trigger is better.

By the way, in a quoted string (like the -t argument), backslash should only
be used to escape a quote or another backslash.  Thus, to use the regexp
  ^\[INFO\]: (.*) (abc|def|ghi) 
as a trigger, you should write the -t option like this:
  -t'^\\[INFO\\]: (.*) (abc|def|ghi) '

In most cases, including the one above, TF will actually do what you
wanted, but you should not rely on it.  For example, say you wanted to
make a keybinding for
  ^[\
(escape backslash).  If you wrote it like this:
  /def -b'^[\' foo = bar
TF would interpret the backslash as escaping the quote, and it would
continue scanning to the end of the line for the closing quote.  So you
must write it like this:
  /def -b'^[\\' foo = bar

If you /set pedantic=on, TF will warn you about incorrect backslash use
in quoted strings (among other things).

I don't know about either of those, but sometime in the next week or so, I will be making syntax files available for 
tf syntax on Object Edit (a text editor that comes with Object Dekstop for Windows) and another for MED available on 
Win32 and or OS/2 on the TF for Windows WebPage at www.druware.com/tf

 This may once again be one of those easy-to-do-if-you-know-how-to
problems, but I can't seem to get it to work.

 My problems is simple: I want a trigger to trig on everything but a few
selected words. E.g. if I type "blah" or "bleh" it won't trigger, but if I
write anything else, it should get caught and triggered on.

 I tried doing this with the following trigger:

/def -Fp1 -mglob 'Text to start the trigger.'\
 trig_start = /set trig_start_time=$[time()]%;/trig_time_report%; \
 /def -ag -F -h'SEND {*}' trig_stop_check = \
  /if (({1} !/ "blah") | \
       ({1} !/ "bleh") ) \
   /echo << Trig activated, time is %%{trig_time} >>%%;\
   /send {%*}%%; \
  /endif

..but it doesn't work. I've tried this so many times around with several
different methods that I got totally confused, and decided it's time for
some proffessional(?) help.

DOes anybody have this???

I have compiled tf for windows using cygwin, but if i'm reading things
right, tf will need the SOCKS library to compile, and to run.
and i have zero clue on how to pull THAT off. any ideas would be greatly
appreciated!

Thanks,
	Kenn

TF does not require SOCKS to run correctly on Win32, nor do you need it if you have a telnet proxy set up 
for your PRoxy Server.  If all you want is a precompiled TF-Win32, you can get that from www.druware.com/tf.

If you NEED SOCKS support I can compile that in this weekend.

Andy

I need it with SOCKS support, as i now have to go thru our SOCKS proxy to
get out to the internet.

if you could compile it this weekend, and make it available, i'd
be very grateful, as w/o it my tf'ing days may grind to a halt soon.



Thanks much,
		Kenn

Not elvis, but the tf web page has syntax coloring for vim (which is superior
vi clone anyway).

Your /if condition is always true:
    ({1} !/ "blah") | ({1} !/ "bleh")

What you mean is:
    ({1} !/ "blah") & ({1} !/ "bleh")
Or, to match your english phrasing (if "blah" or "bleh", don't trigger):
    !({1} =/ "blah" | {1} =/ "bleh")

Hello all, 
  I've sent some mail off to Ken about this, but I think
something is messed up and he's not getting his mail. I
have written the first part of a GUI front end to Tinyfugue.
It's written in C with the GTK toolkit. I have the ability
to link it statically so you don't even need GTK. At this 
point it is very basic, yet powerful, in that  it relays 
your input to TF and takes the output and stuffs it in a 
text box. Therefore, you are able to use all the commands
of TF, with a cute resizeable window, etc. Currently I'm
working on an ANSI color parser, so that ANSI is displayed
correctly. 
  Ken, I would like your permission to distribute this, as
I have a great respect for your work on TinyFugue, thusly,
my gui front end is named Crescendo. The first release would
be available to test and play with. I find it quite useable 
and its all I use now.  I await a responce, as I will not
give this out, unless Ken deems it acceptable. Ken, I hope
you get this email.

Cordially,


WIll LaShell

That I have seen, but I can't use vi(m) since I'v been using emacs tha
last 8 years or so.Well I guess I'll have to hack this myself then.
Thanks for response anyway :)

Oh and I have a little question too...

Is it possible to change colour in the middle of an /ECHO so I can have
more then one colour
in one line? This I'v been tweeking with for some time now, since It
whould be nice to use.
The same thing whould be useful in a /substitute.

I use the following macros so I don't miss directions, It seems like IT
whould be easier to do this someother way but I can't
for my life see how, also the colorization of << and >> don't work
atall, not that it matters all the much since I have bright yellow
on te directions anyhow :)

/def -F -mregexp -t" leaves (north|south|east|west|up|down)( |\.)"
auto_leave_replace =\
        /substitute - <=- %PL leaves <<$[toupper(%P1)]>> %PR
/def -F -mregexp -t" has arrived from (the |)([a-z]+)( |\.)"
auto_arrive_replace =\
        /substitute - -=> %PL has arrived from %P1<<$[toupper(%P2)]>>
%PR

/def -F -P0Cyellow -mregexp -t"(<<|>>)"
/def -F -P0hCyellow -mregexp
-t"(EAST|WEST|NORTH|SOUTH|UP|DOWN|ABOVE|BELOW)"

As an example It whould be nice if one could have the colour changes as
some sort of system variables, how about:

/def -F -mregexp -t" has arrived from (the |)([a-z]+)( |\.)"
auto_arrive_replace =\
        /substitute - %FGyellow-=>%FGnormal %PL has arrived from
%P1%FGyellow<<%FGYELLOW$[toupper(%P2)]%FGyellow>>%FGnormal %PR

Where %FG whould be ForeGround and then a colour, yellow or YELLOW in
this example, Highintensity in capital.

Donno if this whould be a bad I dea, I once coded a simple mudclient and
had a global way of changeing colours
I used something like this then. And in the procedure that displays text
I just changed the colours that way I didn't
have to change any commands when I made new once, they whould all have
colour support on the fly :)

Yust my 1 cent worth...

I have something similar. For fifty matches it's faster to use the latter
example.

Greetings. I've been having some minor problems with a bit of interface
customization, and as the styles and methods I've seen on the list have
been startlingly varied (to say the least) I'm hoping to pick a few brains
for insight.

On several occasions, I've needed TinyFugue to perform some action on an
alphanumeric keypress (hook-style), but my solutions have been problematic
at best. Most recently, I've wanted the input area (visual=on) to resize
automatically to fit the text in it. I've plugged the following into my
.tfrc file, but as is probably obvious, it's a pretty painful hack of a
solution.

	/def ~bind_letter = /def -ib'$[char({*})]' bind_letter.%* = \
		/input $[char({*})] %%; /~resize

	/for i 65 90 /~bind_letter %i

	/for i 97 122 /~bind_letter %i

	/def -ib" " bind.space = /@test input(" ") %; /~resize

	/def ~resize = /set isize=$[1 + kblen() / (columns() - 1)]

I'm open to any suggestions about how this can be handled more smoothly.
If it's potentially useful enough, maybe Ken can be talked into installing
a 'KEYPRESS' hook. (Lousy idea/good idea?)

Thanks.

Hi,

tf sends to me a warning which I don't understand, perhaps one of you can
help me. (Yes, I read /help functions, it did not help me.) The message is:

% walk: walk_getRoom: warning: argument passing semantics for macros called as 
functions has changed in 4.0.  See '/help functions'.

This warning is given when I use the command /walk for the first time, in
short:

/def walk = \
    /let _Ziel %{*}%;\
    /let _Ziel=$[walk_getRoom({_Ziel})]%;\
    ...

/def walk_getRoom = \
    /if ({*}=~"A Fog-Shrouded Trail") /return "Emerald1" %; /endif %;\
       (...and many similar lines)
    /return {*}

By the way, does anyone of you know how to make tf warn EACH time it
encounters such a thing (same for the warning %{variable} in expression)?
I have quite some such "errors" in my code, which is an awful lot of lines,
and I would prefer to be told about them to step by step get rid of them.

Thanks in advance,

     Susan Dittmar

Hi Susan,

I cannot really explain this as I don't really understand it myself :)
But it basically has to do with command form versus function form invocation of macros,
where in command form spaces separate arguments and in function form they
do not. And when you try mixing the two, it almost always works but
sometimes gives this warning.

Perhaps try something like this:

/def walk = \
  /let _Ziel=%*%:\
  /test _Ziel := walk_getRoom(_Ziel)
...

	Im using:
TinyFugue version 4.0 beta 2.
Built for SunOS Generic_103093-23 5.5
	Under a zMud windows, just because of maps...

	My question:
	Whats mean of the character (hex 0F) than tf sends after bold 
sequences? Could i set him to stop it?
	Or i just can set zMud to gag it?


Thanks for your atention.

PS: Could someone give me some help with make data strutures in tf like graph
of rooms, so i would need anymore of zMud.

I have been working on this a while, it is a library that emulates
tintin++ almost completely using send hooks. I've written it mostly for my
friends that are too lazy to learn a new mud client, even if it is alot
better :) You can find it at:

This excerpt from the next version's "/help functions" should clarify
things:

| Macros and builtin commands can be called using function syntax, unless
| there is a builtin function with the same name. The syntax is
| "name(parm1, ... parmN)". A builtin command called as a function can
| have 0 or 1 arguments; the argument is treated as a command line. For
| example, the function call
| 
|   def("-t'{*} has arrived.' greet = :waves.")
| 
| is the same as the command invocation 
| 
|   /def -t'{*} has arrived.' greet = :waves."
| 
| A macro called as a function can be called with any number of
| arguments; each argument corresponds to a positional parameter (%1, %2,
| etc.). For example, assuming "spam" is a macro, the function call
| 
|   spam("foo", "bar", "baz")
| 
| is the same as the command invocation 
| 
|   /spam foo bar baz
| 
| The function call syntax allows positional parameters to contain
| spaces, which is not possible in the command syntax. (Note: prior to
| version 4.0, a macro called as a function could only take 0 or 1
| arguments, and a single argument was broken into positional parameters
| at whitespace.)

The warning occurs the first time you call a non-invisible (-i) macro using
function syntax with exactly one argument which contains space, e.g.

  spam("foo bar baz")

because that behaves differently now.  Specifically, in 3.x, %1 == "foo",
%2 == "bar", and %3 == "baz"; but in 4.0, %1 == "foo bar baz".  The
warning occurs the first time to inform people who didn't read the new
/help carefully that their old macros may be broken.  However, a
warning for every occurance of such code would be annoying, since it is
still valid code (maybe you really want %1 == "foo bar baz").  Invisible
macros are ignored so that warnings are not generated in standard TFLIBDIR
code not controlled by the user.

The meaning of spam() with 0 arguments and spam("foo") with 1 single-word
argument has not changed, so they do not generate warnings.  The call
spam("foo bar", "baz") was not valid in 3.x, so again no warning for
unexpected behavior is needed (in 4.0, %1 == "foo bar", and %2 == "baz").

The function syntax warning can not be changed.  But many other warnings,
including the warning for %{var} syntax in an expression, can be enabled
with "/set pedantic=on" (which I highly recommend).

It would be cool if there was a way to store passwords in crypted format
somewhere.  Doing /addworld <charname> <password> is nice, but if you
for some reason are concerned about security of your files on a given
box, it isn't something you can make use of.

I don't know of a clean way to implement this w/o using some kind of
/addworld command while running tf that would add the info to a saved
database, but it'd be nice to see.

Well crypt() would not be the way.  Perhaps an encrypted file that you had
to know the password to, but there is in all honesty no truly secure way to
store passwords without having to enter a password.  And crypt() definately
won't work because it is intended for storing passwords for verification
later, not for storing passwords for retreival.  In fact, there is no way
to recover a crypted password.  (Well there may be, besides password
grinding, but if there is, it's not known)

Yeah, I realized right I sent it that crypt() wouldn't do it at all.  That's
what I get for thinking right after I wake up ;)

You're right, it would have to be something to do with starting tf with a
password.  Anyone with the know-how willing to write something that would
allow me to keep the file with my addworld stuff encrypted, then prompt
for that password when I started tf?

Use PGP and pipe 'world.tf' through it when you start TinyFugue, then have
it reencrypt when you exit TinyFugue.  Invoke TinyFugue through some
script like this:

pgpv -o world.tf world.tf.pgp
tf
pgpe -o world.tf.pgp world.tf

Oh, you'll likely have to dink with it.  You'll have to set up the default
key, you should be sure that 'world.tf' is 'user only read-write'.  You
might need to set up absolute directories.  If you want to get really
grim, you could even set up a shell to do this 'on-the-fly' to have it
decrypt the info only as it needs it, and somehow perhaps not have it hit
the hard drive unencrypted.

In my case, I encrypt logs I archive to zip disk, but that's about it.  If
you are using Win95 which has no enduser security, or if you are using a
public server where your files are exposed and there's nothing you can do,
you might consider installing Linux if possible, even if you are using the
computer from a remote location.  I've telnetted into my own computer at
home from the public library and run TinyFugue from there.  It's about as
secure as I'm going to want for what I do.

From the sound of your situation, your TinyFugue passwords would be only
one of your concerns: Your email, your logfiles, your private work would
be just as open.  While an encryption tool such as PGP can _help_, the
best place to start is to reduce your risks of all around exposure.

Best 'o luck!

OK folks..  

I have it compiling and working to a point, but my time to work on it has dissolved.  If anyone is 
interested in picking up the work, I'll be more than happy to provide what I've done so far.  

Right now I have 4.0 b 1 and b 2 compiling and working until you actually connect to a world at which 
point my hacked implementation of select() that allows the us of FD's as socket descriptors blocks on the 
second keypress.  

I think it's a screwup in the select() implementation.  Two things to keep in mind though.  The rumor 
mills has it that BeOS R4 will include a revamped select() that is more BSDish, and I am primarily a 
Pascal programmer with just enough C/C++ to be VERY dangerous, so the code may be utterly unusable.

If you're running on a unix based machine, that's actually quite easy..

Just do this:
/sh ls -alF

Mad.

Hello,

I try to program a macro which takes a numeric argument and puts this number in
the -n argument of the /def command.
I try this:

/def -i try = /eval /def -n%{1} -p1 -mregexp -aBCyellow -t' the huge (.*)$' cap
ture01 = /echo %{PL} %{P1}

But the only thing I get when I call it is:

% macro not defined: '
% def: unmatched ' in t option

But I can't see anything wrong there. It looks as if it should work this way.
:-)

Any ideas how to get what I want?

TIA, Harry

	First of all, you don't need the /eval.  Second, you need to
double-up key parts in your second /def, otherwise they'll be expanded
when the /try gets executed (which I'm assuming you don't want).  Note
the first example in /help def.  And finally, depending on the output 
that you're trying to capture, you may be able to exchange the expensive 
(.*) with somethign a bit more sane.  So try this:

/def -i try = /def -n%{1} -p1 -mregexp -aBCyellow -t' the huge (.*)$$' 
	capture01 = /echo %%{PL} %%{P1}

	And if you really want to capture everythign after 'huge' to
the end of the line, then use this:

/def -i try = /def -n%{1} -p1 -mglob -aBCyellow -t'* the huge (*)' 
	capture01 = /echo %%{PL} %%{P1}

Maybe someone has some insight into a problem that I am having.

I have no problems defining and calling macros, but I cannot seem to get
triggers working for anything.  I have tried mutliple ways of defining
them and they just don't seem to respond to anything.

simple example.

/trig "hello" = say goodbye

from what I understand, any instance of hello that appears should cause me
to say goodbye on the mud.  Nothing ever happends.

Is there a compilation option that I missed, or a variable that I have set
incorrectly?

Thanks,

Stephen

You're forgetting about the matching type - If you don't supply a -m option,
you'll default to whatever's in %matching, which unless you changed it should
be glob.  For information on how to do a glob match, see /help glob.  Also
take a look at /help matching.

You'll likely want:
/def -mglob -t'*hello*' hello = say goodbye

or with regexp (/help regexp):
/def -mregexp -t'hello' hello = say goodbye

Mike was right about the /eval and the metacharacter doubling, and his
first solution is correct.  But his glob enhancement does not work, because
glob patterns do not set the %Pn parameters.  The regexp can be simplified,
though:

  /def -i try = /def -n%{1} -p1 -mregexp -aBCyellow -t' the huge ' 
  	capture01 = /echo %%{PL} %%{PR}

Those who answered forgot to answer to this question directly.
What is wrong here is the "-signs.
/trig hello = say goodbye
would trigger on a line which contains only "hello",
/trig *hello* = say goodbye
would do what you wanted.

On the other hand, I recommend not to use the /trig command. You cannot
name your triggers with the /trig command, so you cannot redefine them,
the old /trig's will always stay in if you define a new /trig with the
same trigger pattern. Therefore I always use /def -t"<pattern>".
(Solutions with /def were posted already.)

Hi,

This is probably a popular question, but I can't easily find the answer,
so I'll go ahead and ask here.

I have a file, the contents of which I would like to send to a world
prepended with "@emit ".

Normally, I would use something like:

	/quote @emit '"file.txt"

But I am lazy.  What I want to do is something like this:

	/q file.txt

Any ideas on how I'd define "q" to make this possible?

In addition, I sometimes have something in my copy/paste buffer which I'd
like to spew into tf and have everything prepended, say, with @emit during
the time of the splat.  What I was thinking of here was a toggle so that
events would transpire thusly:

	/qtoggle on		-- A command prefix is set so that
				   all commands sent to the world are
				   prefixed with "@emit "
	<paste>
	/qtoggle off		-- Command prefix unset.

I'm not quite sure how to do this in the first place, let alone how to get
the trailing space encoded.  Thoughts?

Thanks for any help.

Hi

Is there a spec. variable or something to turn off the "% Resuming
TinyFugue." text on the return from /sh. Or another way, to exec script
without any output.
Second (not so important) problem: When logged in to a server, there is a
double-echo when I type something. It's like this:
say Hell_   <- inputing text, and then I get:

say Hello
say Hello
>You said: Hello
 
I didn't spend much time to figure out what's on this thing, but it fixes
if I do a /localecho off, and immediately after it a /localecho on.
Any idea, how to fix this? I've already searched for a spec. variable on
this, but didn't find the right one. It's a strange thing, that when I do
the /localecho off and on in a /def, it doesn't work (the echo stays).

Thanx in advance.

Bye.
Demon.

n variables named array_1, array_2 ... array_n and find that?

Thanks for any help.

when you connected to a new place using /world -l <address>, (unnamedX) gets
created, and X increases with each new /world -l. once i've disconnected from an
(unnamedX) world, is there a way i can find out the address of that world.

what i mean is i've connected to a place and disconnected without noting the
address, and it isn't in any /recall logs :(

i use a quick hack:

gzip your file with your passwords in it, eg, .tfrc, with a different suffix:

gzip -S.doc .tfrc

and place the following in your local.tf:

; GNU compression
/def -i COMPRESS_SUFFIX=.doc
/def -i COMPRESS_READ=gzip -c -d -S.doc

if you ever need to edit .tfrc just gzip -d -S.doc it.
it's simple, but giving it a suffix other than .gz is likely to foil any git who
wants to look at your passwords, unless they look at the header, or indeed if
they've read this :)

Don't be fooled into thinking this provides any kind of security whatsoever;
if anyone has knowledge enough to somehow break the system and thereby access
files in your account, chances are they know enough to do a:

# file fray.doc
fray.doc: gzip compressed data, deflated, original filename, last modified:
Thu Aug 21 22:46:11 1997, max compression, os: Unix

If you want to secure your tiny.world or .tfrc files, you'll need to play
around with something like pgp and make sure it doesnt write the plaintext to
anywhere on disk (/tmp, etc). Even then, someone with root access while
you're running tf can just access the plaintext from memory.

Sounded to me like an overall system security threat issue in which
TinyFugue passwords would be among the least of problems.

Hello,

I wonder what I'd need to run a testserver to test new macros. I'd like to
connect to a server which just looks like a terminal where I can also type
commands via the keyboard.
This way I could enter the proper lines which I usually get from the mud and see
what my macro is doing.

Any ideas how to get a server like this ?

Harry

You could just set mecho=on and use /trigger's.

It might be more simple just to grab a copy that's like your favorite MUD
server, and you can use it for more than running TinyFugue, such as
finding security holes to exploit or to understand how to squeeze more
performance from your character.  If the server of your heart's desire
simply is not available, I know of the MUCK server used by FurryMUCK,
http://www.belfry.com/fuzzball/ is freely available, and setup isn't _too_
bad.  There are likely better servers to use, perhaps even a 'do-nothing'
server just like you want.  But if you are going to go through the
trouble, you may as well duplicate the conditions of where you enjoy
playing and run it as a private test server.  You'll get more milage for
your effort that way.

Also check http://otterspace.com/~nameless/ where we are putting together
a software package for use with FurryMUCK.  The package isn't for Beta
release yet, but it will duplicate software available on NamelessMUCK so
again, you may run a test server and get the inside scoop of the software
running there as the GOD player.  We hope it's a development idea that
catches on with other MU*'s.  The starter database with FuzzballMUCK is
terribly insecure and buggy.

Hope you can access the MU* server of your heart's desire, but if not...
as close as you can get will likely prove more useful than a 'goes
nowhere, does nothing' blank server.

Several people have suggested actually running a copy of your MUD server,
which is certainly educational, but may be more work than you care to
undertake. If all you truly want is a dummy 'world' you can connect to, which
you can type commands into from somewhere outside of tf and have tf react to
this input, check out something like netcat
(ftp://avian.org/src/hacks/netcat-1.10.tgz) which is a lightweight package
designed to do just that.

This tiny little tool is exactly what I've been looking for. Its perfect for
testing mud stuff and will also be helpful in many other things. :-)

Thanks alot for the hint!

Alternatively, if I understand the request correctly, you could just
connect to port 7 (the echo port) of many (but not all, to be fair)
systems, wherein anything you type or send will be sent back, line by
line.

Hi,

Why not just use /trigger <text>

Read /help trigger for more information.

Yep, it's certainly a handy little bugger. I've used netcat for everything
from packet dumps of suspect port scans to acting as pipes to funnel around
data for network backups. Definitely a worthwhile tool to have in your belt
:-)

Hi,

The problem was, to find a way, to execute a shell command, without any
output on screen. /sh is not good, 'cos it writes % Resuming * - text on
the screen. But I forgot to say, I need this command in background, so
like "/sh -q [command]&" but without the % Resuming text.
With /sys and /quote I can't make my script to run in background, because
it produces a command such as : { [command]; } <dev/null 2>%1
I would be very pleased, if someone had an idea.

Thanks.
Demon.

I wrote a noddy little pipe program to server sounds from TF.

I use:

/sys tfsound klaxon.wav

with the tfsound script:

#!/bin/sh
echo $1 > /home/mpc/.sounder

You need to create the pipe .sounder (or .execpipe, or whatever), and
the following bit of C for a 'sound server':

#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

main()
{
    int funix, n, l;
    char line[4096], name[2048];
    fd_set readfds;

    funix = open("/home/mpc/.sounder", O_RDWR);
    if (funix < 0) {
            printf("Cannot create pipe endpoint.\n");
            return -5;
    }
    
        /* Main loop begins here. */
        FD_ZERO(&readfds);


    for (;;) {

                /*
                 * Add the Unix Domain Socket to the list of read
                 * descriptors.
                 */
                FD_SET(funix, &readfds);

		n = select(FD_SETSIZE, &readfds, NULL, NULL, NULL);
                if (n > 0) {
			l = read(funix, name, 2048);
			name[l - 1] = '\0';
			sprintf(line, "cat /home/mpc/mmedia/sounds/%s > /dev/dsp\n", name);
			system(line);
                }

    }
}


The principle: Cheat. Spawn a very fast syncronous call that just
echo's the name of the sound file to the pipe. The server (that you
start before tf in the background), reads from the pipe, and does
the sound generation.

Note: The server is not the most efficient bit of C, nor is it overly
secure. It is a quick hack I threw together to tie sounds to trigger
matching.

Eg, the following macro sounds a kalxon when a new contact is seen,
provided we didn't sound off in the last 60 seconds:

/set ATS_Contact_Sound=Yes
/set ATS_Contact_pid=-1

/def -i -wMFrl -mglob -t`\[WARNING\]--\[New sensor contact (*): Ship\]` ATS_Contact_Alert=\
	/IF (ATS_Contact_Sound =~ "Yes") \
		/set ATS_Contact_Sound=No %; \
		/sys tfsound klaxon.wav %; \
		/repeat -60 1 /set ATS_Contact_Sound=Yes %; \
		/set ATS_Contact_pid=%? %; \
	/ELSE \
		/kill %ATS_Contact_pid %; \
		/repeat -60 1 /set ATS_Contact_Sound=Yes %; \
		/set ATS_Contact_pid=%? %; \
	/ENDIF

Mark

How about making the comman you execute a script, called runme, like:

---------->8-----cut here--------->8------------
#!/bin/sh
$@ >/dev/null 2>&1 &
---------->8-----cut here--------->8------------

That is... execute the script, which is turn till start the program you
want to run (the command is sent in as an argument to the script).
The script simply executes the command in the background, so it returns
instantly. Wouldn't that work?

Hi Mikael,

TF waits until all the child processes exit before resuming.
(At least when compiled on Linux/Redhat 5.1)

Hi

Thanx for all the help 'bout the % Resuming problem. I think I've found a
good solvation on this:
/def -ag -hRESUME
It's very simple, and kills the % Resuming text, and I can use the /sh
command. AND the /sh command doesn't wait for child processes to
terminate, so you can start background processes.
The problem on this is, it makes something with the screen (refresh, or
something) when in /visual mode. It's a good thing I don't use /visual
mode (:

Bye.
Demon.

As long as you're hacking COMPRESS_SUFFIX, you might as well hack
COMPRESS_READ to be an actual decryption program, instead of gzip.

But you can just as easily write a decrypting version of /load without
interfering with the compression feature:

  /def xload = /quote -S -dexec !decrypt %1
  /xload worlds.tfx

You can do your editing outside of tf, or on a unix system you could even
use something like this:

  /def xwritefile = \
      /quote -0 -decho !mkfifo -m 600 fifo; encrypt <fifo >"%1"; rm fifo%; \
      /writefile fifo

  /eval /listworlds -c %| /xwritefile worlds.tfx

"/quote -0" essentially runs the shell command in the background.
Error checking and an "-a" append option are left as an exercise to the
reader.

Use tf's "background", not the shell's.  E.g.,

  /quote -0 -decho !command

You can do whatever shell i/o redirection you want (and you probably do
want to make sure it produces no output), but do NOT use a "&" to make
the shell background the command.  The only difference between this and
/sys is that /sys uses -S, which makes tf wait for the command to
finish, while this uses -0.

Hello,

is it possible to bind F1, SHIFT+F1 CTRL+F1 and ALT+F1 to different functions? I
got the normal keys bind to a macro but all combinations with CTRL/ALT/SHIFT
result in the same key code.
Can I somehow find out which other keys are pressed ?

TIA, Harry

That entirely depends on whether your terminal application sends
ascii codes for these keys to the tf-application.
As you seem to get the same result with every combination, you
can safely assume that your terminal program is not that good.
(That means there's no way to do it without replacing your terminal
 program...)

Also keep in mind that function keys are not bound to the same combination
on every machine (I use ^[[[A, ^[[M, ^[OP, ^[[224z, ^[[001q and ^[[11~
for F1 and ^[[23~, ^[[Y for Shift-F1 ;-). TF also has the builtin defines
F1 and Shift-F1 for that, but unfortunately these don't work on several
of the lousy configured systems I work with...

Well, there has been no responce from Ken, so I don't know
how he feels about this, but probably on Sunday or Monday,
the first version of Crescendo WILL be available for public
testing. Basically I'm trying to nail down some ANSI color
problems, and may just release the non colored version.
I am planning to release both source code, and a few
precompiled binaries. To compile from source, there are 2
requirements.  A) you must have gtk-1.1 and b) you must
have an existing TF. To use the precompiled binaries,
I'll most likely offer static, and shared binaries. I'm
sorry that I can't offer gtk-1.0 binaries, but my current
developement environment just won't allow it. All feedback
please send my way, reports of it working, not working,
etc etc,  If any of you have any questions, please send
them and I'll do my best to answer. Andy, I've lost your
email addy, if you send me some mail, I'll get you some
code. :)  Thank you all.

Hello,

I put some triggers together which meassure the lag every few seconds.
It sends a "tell player ..." message to yourself and checks how long this takes,
collecting the times and displaying it as a diagram on request.

If anyone is interested in that just email me. :-)

If I read the help files right, partial hilights are supossed to only be
some default color. Well, what if you want to make them another color, and
have different partials come up different colors?

Say I have 3 different partial highlights I want to do...

HSW>
Corbeth>
At your place,

I want HSW to be bright Blue, Corbeth to be bright Yellow, and 'At your
place,' to be bright White. How can I format each of them to switch on and
off without being totally screwy to any other partial hilights I may have
configured elsewhere?

They don't have to be just one color, no :)

/def -F -P1xBCBlue -t'(HSW>)'
/def -F -P1xBCyellow -t'(Corbeth>)'
/def -F -P1xBCwhite -t'(At your place,)'

..should work. However, you should probably set the priority of each of
these (with -p) so that they are either executed before or after your
other partial hilights. From what you've said, I would think you'd set
a low priority so that they run after. Of course, if you do have any
other hilights around, you'll need to make sure that you use -F in them
so that they 'fall through' to these definitions above.

Hope this helps,

I really like these two defs.  Not only are the pages in RED, but
I get a "bell" which tells me I just had a page (in case I'm across
the room).


/def -p1 -ahbCred -t"* pages:*" page 
/def -p1 -ahbCred -t"From afar,*" pages 


Now, I notice that my /def's are different from the above, especially
in regards to the flags.  guess I better go look up what x does.

Sounds like a good one to put up over the mail list, if the macro isn't
too long. ;)

Count me as one interested.

As there seem several people to be interesten in that, I put the stuff on my web
server. You can find it at http://www.respublica.de/lag.tf
The setup for how to use it is included in the file itself. If you have any
suggestions, questions or problems please let me know.

First might I suggest a -a attributes flag in /quote.

Secondly, the example macro given below has the problem that the /recall line
doesn't get executed. I have left it's ending %; out because when left in, the
following /else body doesn't get executed, so I am left with the choice of
either not having that, or not having the /recall line executed :(

Let's get to the chopper!

/def -i example = \
        /if (getopts("e")) \
                /let file=$[strcat(note_dir, "/", tolower({*}))] %; \
                /if ({opt_e}) \
                        /sh -q pico %file %; \
                        /recall -g -q $[lines() - (visual ? isize + 2 : 0)] \
                /endif %; \
        /else \
                /let file=$[strcat(note_dir, "/", tolower({1}))] %; \
                /if (tfopen(file, "r") == -1) \
                        /_echo %% File %{1} not found. %; \

Firstly, getopts will ALWAYS return 1 here, so the /else block will never
get executed, as it should be. Try it, eg: 

/def blah = /echo $[getopts("e")]

/blah
1
/blah -e
1

Secondly, what is the purpose of that recall line? Executing a shell
command pauses tf processing, so when you come back you'll get a bunch of
scroll from the latest mud output, ending with the last screen, this will
just echo the last screen again. 

Thirdly, you are trying to use quote on a file handle. If you want to use
tfio, use tfread() or /readfile or some such, and /quote will tell you
whether or not it was able to open the file.

So what you want is something like this:

/def -i note = \
  /if (!getopts("e")) /break%; /endif %; \
  /let _file=$[strcat(note_dir, "/", tolower({1}))] %; \
  /if (opt_e) \
    /def -ag -n1 -hRESUME temp_resume_gag %; \
    /sh -q pico %_file %; \
  /else \ 
    /echo -ar %% Contents of file %1: %; \
    /quote -decho -S '%_file %; \
    /echo -ar %% End of %1. %; \
  /endif  

Have fun,

Raf

I'm trying to run tf through a proxy server running WinGate under Windows
NT.  (I'm using tf-4.0a9 for Linux.)  I had to redefine the proxy_function
because WinGate expects simply "host.dom:port" after its prompt instead of
"telnet host.dom port".  Here's the code I'm using:

/def proxy_command =\
    /def -p10000 -1 -h'PROMPT WinGate>' =\
        /localecho on%%; \
        $${world_host}:$${world_port}%%; \
        /def -p10002 -1 -h'PROMPT WinGate>' proxy_error_$${world_name} =\
            /undef proxy_success_$$${world_name}%%%;\
            /dc%%;\
        /def -p10002 -1 -t'Connected' proxy_success_$${world_name} =\
            /undef proxy_error_$$${world_name}%%%;\
            /trigger -hCONNECT $$${world_name}%%%;\
            /if ($$${world_character} !~ "") \
                /trigger -hLOGIN ${world_name}%%%;\
            /endif

And here's what happens when I try to log in to my default world:

% LC_TIME category set to "C" locale.
% Loading commands from /usr/lib/tf-40a9-lib/stdlib.tf.
% Loading commands from /usr/local/home/ender/.tfrc.
% /usr/local/home/ender/.tfrc, lines 3-15: def: Redefined macro proxy_command
% You have mail in /var/spool/mail/ender
% Activity in world IFmud
___________________________________________(Active: 1)_____________________02:02


At this point, no more text shows up and tf stops echoing my keystrokes
(I've tried it both with and without the "localecho on" in the above
macro).  I know its processing my keys, and is connected, because typing
blind "/connect IFmud" returns

% connect: socket to IFmud already exists

and "/quit" gets me out.  But it doesn't give me any of the text from the
world.

Any ideas what's going on?  I've taken a bried look at the WinGate setup
and it doesn't seem to be a problem at that end.

That's a system dependant error number.  TF will display a more meaningful
string if the system provides one, but apparently yours did not.  You'll
have to look up 118 yourself on your system (e.g., in /usr/include/errno.h
or /usr/include/sys/errno.h).

It's connected all right, and the activity notices indicate that there was
even text received.  It's just in the background.  Use "/fg IFmud" (for
example) to bring it to the foreground.

The only question is why it didn't come to the foreground automatically.
Normally, that is done with a CONNECT hook defined in the library; do you
have another non-fall-through CONNECT hook blocking it?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Usually, I run multiple sessions of TinyFugue with only one world
each; I use virtual consoles under Linux, which means I can always get
to the TF connected to world one by doing alt-F1, world two with
alt-F2, etc.

The past two days, however, I've been doing graphic editing under
X-Windows, and thus have been using TF under X-Win instead of the
consoles as I usually do.  To conserve both desktop space and memory,
I've been doubling up, doing two worlds per session (and xterm).

I have a system going whereby, whenever my system loses its netlink
(which it does on a very regular basis), my standard TF session that
monitors my system logfiles will send a SIGUSR1 to all the other TF
sessions when the net goes down, and then they all /retry until they
find the network usable again.

This worked fine, until recently.  However, as stated above, the past
two days or so, I haven't been using my system as I usually do.  I
find that occasionally (three times in two days), TF gets totally
confused, and if I try to send to world one, the signal has a 50-50
chance of being redirected to world two.  If I disconnect from one
world, generally, if I then try to send to the other world, I get a
'bad file number' disconnect.  Output from both worlds can also be
occasionally garbled.

I can only assume that, in the shuffle of disconnecting and then
reconnecting to both worlds near-simultaneously, under a bit of lag
due to X-Windows, TinyFugue is getting confused, possibly due to
nonblocking connects.

I'm running TF 4.0 alpha 4 simply due to a lack of time to upgrade.
Has this been fixed in more recent releases, or is it a bug that's
still out there?  I'll probably make the time one of these days to
upgrade and figure that out for myself, but if it's still not fixed,
this might be something to look into.

Ah.  The 'Connected' /def isn't firing, so its not calling either the
CONNECT or LOGIN hooks.  (To get it all to work, I have to type "/fg
IFmud", "/localecho on", and login by hand.)

No, the only thing I've changed is proxy_command.  Otherwise its
out-of-the-box.

So why isn't that nested macro firing?  Connecting through telnet gives
this:


WinGate>fovea.retina.net:4000
Connecting to host fovea.retina.net...Connected


Which looks like it should work to me.

Every once in a while, someone asks how to point a trigger towards a WAV

email from this list and couldn't find any saved messages pertaining to that.

Any chance someone could post an example again?

Thanks!

I'd like help with a macro that would randomly send the message "&tee-shirt
me=<random text>" every time I connected to a specific world. I know how to
write the connect hook, but, I don't know how to randomize from a list of
"sayings".

This would be used (obviously?) to randomize a character's tee-shirt
expressions so each time I logged in they would be different. I know how to
write this in MUSH code, but, I'm trying to move as many commands off the
game as possible since TF is written to handle things like this anyway.

Under older builds of the Cygnus DLL that TF uses to work on Win32, TF could easily use the the /sh 
command to do this.  In newer releases of the cygwin DLL's /sh does some funky things.  In an effort to 
alleviate this, I personally rebuilt TF to include a /winexec that let's me use a full command line.  
unfortunately that's pretty complex for what you want.  

I'm trying not to make too many changes to the TF Base code itself, but I think in this instance a 
/shellexec would be appropriate.  If I get to it this week I will build a copy of 40b2 that includes these 
cahnges and actually fix and update my web page and it's braindead broken links..

	Depends.  Is your default matching regexp or glob?  If
you're running strictly 'out-of-the-box', then your default matching
will be glob, and simply 'Connected' won't match your string as
you've given it.  
	Either add in a '-mregexp' to your /def, or
change your pattern to be -t'*Connected'.  You could do '*Connected*'
if you really wanted to, but I personally like to be as accurate
as possible in my patterns.  
	You should probably explicity specify a -m option in your 
/def anyway, incase you later change your default 
matching, or even chagne it for a 'quick second' while running TF.
It's just a Good Idea (tm).

If anyone's interested in othello.tf, drop me a line.
It's a set of macros that implement the game Othello (aka Reversi).
It's probably not the cleanest or best (and it's not written in 4.0),
but it works for me, so I thought I'd share it.  It only does
2-player (human vs human) play, but it wouldn't be too hard to have
the computer pick moves.

If there are more than just a few responses, I'll post it to the list.

Even more shocking, I actually updated the webpage to boot!

Someone wrote a couple of macros which would do just that.
Usage is: random_file_line <file>
You'd get a random line from that file returned.
Apology to the author of the macro for not acknowledging you but I don't

/def -i random_file_line = \

Hi - I'm first time at that list, my nick: Maro
Hiya guys!
I've got some questions about tf:

1. How to trigger few lines, fo example action will be only when
few lines like here will be shown :

Far to the South : A Doddering Old Sot
Far to the South : The RagMan
to the North : Xanthus the Healer
to the South : The RagMan
to the South : Orban, Page to the High Prince
Down : Max The Banker

You know not only one line but six as here. Now I'm able to
trigger a line.
2. How to organize such a thing - telling to people for example
I want to type : "Heya Janek, Franek, Zosia, Jozek Nice to see
you 

And on screen I will see :
You tell Janek Nice to see you
You tell Franek Nice to see you
You tell Zosia Nice to see you
You tell Jozek Nice to see you

It'll be useful not only for tells of course
3. How to make commands only for one world when I'm on two, three
or even more worlds simultaneously. 
For example I want the same command name - /jedz 
world1 - it makes c san
world2 - it makes sl
world3 - it makes say Hiya

Dependent in which world I'm now.

I tried something like that :
/def -wwordl1 jedz = c san
/def -wwordl2 jedz = sl
/def -wwordl3 jedz = say Hiya
I want something similar

4. How to make my commands only for one world in order they'd
have effect only for one world, even If i change them (I'm at the
same time on 4 world and change them from time to time.

I don't to see : Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
.
.
.
.
Huh?
Because lines off commands from the world I was at before
interferere with that world I'm at now.


5. What to do to make tf react only for exact triggers
/def -t"to the * : Train Monitor" = /dopath %1
reacts on:
"to the east : Train Monitor"
and "Far to the east : Train Monitor"




                  Maro



Thanks in advance for your answer. If you'll be able to answer
only for some problems from a list above answer them please, even
if only for one.


 
P.S. Thanks for all of things.

Or, if you'd rather keep the list right in the macro instead of in a
dedicated file,

  /def random_arg = /result {R}

which you use like this:

  /def random_tee_shirt = \
     &tee-shirt-me=$[random_arg( \
        "TinyFugue: for mudders who care more about power than prettiness.", \
        "DruidMUCK: on the Internet, no one knows you're a tree.", \
        "My tf connected to CaveMUCK and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.")]

I assume that "*." should be ".*" ;-)

/def -P1h -t' says:' = \
	/set who=$[strcat({PL}, " says:")]

and {who} contains your full match (if you really want this "says:" in it
anyway. {PL} contains the beginning of the line.

I subscribed the list and wonder if anybody has an archive of
that list in a file.
Maybe there is such an archive on www site provided.
That's because I want to know the problems that was discussed
here and do not touch them again by an accident and of course to
know some interesting things about tf.

So:
1. If anybody has such ac archive PLEASE contact me :))
2. If there is a web site with that PLEASE gimme an addres :)
Thanks in advance for that info.

Hi,

I'm wondering if there's a way to edit the line which notifies you of
world changes.  When I switch to world Utopia, I get:

	---- World Utopia ----

Is the format for this line configurable?

I finally decided to try tinyfugue now that ive gone 100% linux, but
when I connected to the mud I normally play on, the display did'nt
fit my screen.  I thought maybe it had something to do with my
display libraries, but I tried the windows port and got the same
problem.  I even tried removing the visual bar, but i need the screen
moved up a couple of lines so I can see the prompt.  I play at
mud.phrozen.org 9000 , could someone take a look and see whats going
on.  I'd really appriciate some feedback on how to solve this problem
thanks.

According to /help hooks, the WORLD hook defines this behavior.
You should be able to redefine it as desired.

Hi!

I have some problem using status_line in situations where it's updated
with nearly every textline that comes from the mud (e.g. by triggers)
during combat. 
The problem itself seems to be caused by the line, if i reconfigure my
script, not to change the line but leave it alone, it all seems to
work.
What doesn't work?
Well, the line shows my status (sometimes updated with nearly every
line in rush periods with lotsa triggers, and the all the sudden, i
don't get any output in the window any more (the status_line still
works and the mud still reacts to every imput, TF just doesn't send
the text to me any more).
The strange thing is, i've tried it with the WIN32 (tf 4.0 beta2) and
linux compiled (tf 4.0 beta 2 and 3) version, all seem to lock up
after a while, but a friend of mine uses a script similar to mine
(Well, mine's based in his with only sliht changes) in solaris
environment (tf 4.0 alpha 11) succesfully.
I first though it was caused by some gag triggers but it still locks
up when i remove them all and set gag=no .. I reduced the amount of
triggers but that only slows down the progress and in some situations
the triggers are needed that fast.
I know it's hard to find such problems but if someone has a hint what
i could try ...

I checked with telnet and tinyfugue. It seems to me that it's a standard
diku mud. If you connected with /connect mud.phrozen.org 9000, then your 
prompt is screwed up indeed. You need to use:

/adddiku phrozen <your_name> <your_passwd> mud.phrozen.org 9000

and then /world phrozen.

That way your prompt will be ok.

Save that line in a file and launch tf with the -f<file> option.

See /help adddiku, /help addworld, /help world and /help tf for more info.

Ciao, Duckie.

what i mean is i've connected to a place and disconnected without noting the

Hello,

I'd like to highlight certain words in a line which gets caught by a general
trigger like this:

You glow red.
You glow bright green.

I want to trigger this line with something like a regex match

/def -p1 -mregexp -t'You glow (bright |slightly |)' trig01 = 

And then replace %{P1} and %{PR} with the appropriate inverted colors
(background red/green with white letters).

Any idea how to get this done ?

Harry

/help def, see the section for the -P option.  Or /help partial.

Hmmm, but that doesnt solve my problem. I want to hilite the colors "red"
"green" and such in the lines starting with "You glow", but NOT in any other
lines. And the part "You glow" should not be hilited.

Hrm.  Maybe I'm not understanding what you need.

/def -P1Cwhite,Cbgred -t'You glow (red).' glow_red_trig

will take lines saying 'You glow red.' and display them with the 'red' as
white text on a red background.

Using the above, it won't be.  That's what the -P (partial) option is for.

The above will match on the regexp 'You glow (red).'.  The '1' option on the
-P applies the partial hilite to the 1st parenthesized subexpression (the
'red').  The 'C' options color just this part white on a red background.

From '/help def':
  -P[<n>][nurfdBhC]

          the <n>th parenthesized subexpression in a regexp trigger.

Hi there,

the examples posted by Mark Cooke did exactly what I wanted to do. I didn't see
that -P really solves the problem when I'd use () in the regex. :-)

That's what I was looking for:

/def -F -P1nCred -mregexp -t'^You glow (red)\.'

Thanks to everybody who sent me his thoughts.

Harry

Alright, I've found myself on a MUX that treats who like WHO, so I can
do softcode work arounds to make 'who' work like '+who'.. So my question
is, is there a way to bind 'who' to '+who', ONLY if 'who' is the only
word on the input line? Thanks.

This is perfect for a SEND hook.

  /def -msimple -T'tiny.mux' -h'SEND who' mux_who = /send +who

 Hello , i am plaing a mud , angalon , and i wanted to colour some words to
notice them easyer , i did that , with hit,bruise,... when i hit they are
underlined and a creature hits me: hits,bruises,... this words are reversed.
 Then i thought to colour the levels of hits but not with the same colour
... so i write the next line but they don't work!
 Could anyone tell me why is that ? Please !
                                                 Thanks , Archie.

  Greetings, my friends.
1.
 In the version 4.0b3 of tf running on Solaris I have this problem with 3
and 5 on numpad: when numlock is off Keypap generates some new
codes ([Ox, where x letter)  all but 3 and 5 keys.. nothing appears on
screen  ( you can be sure that my keyb is ok becouse when  numlock is on i
get the 3 and 5 numbers).
2. 
 How can i bind the up and down arrows to send Ctrl-p and Ctrl-n ?
3.
 Is there any way to unalias all aliasses with a single command? something
like /purge for /def
    

                  Thanks alot.

  Hello , i want to hilite some parts of a line for exemple if i would have
the line: 
 The bright dressed human says: hello iuli ! 
  comeing from socket i need that the 'The bright dressed human says:' to be
hilited.the next def gets the string in %{PL} but this doesn't help me:
  /def -mregexp -t'(:) '
 There is a solution but is very ineficient :
 /def -P1h -t'^(.* ):'
 Could anyone tell me a more eficient way to solve my problem ?

On the MUCK I've not seen a way to 'interactivly parse' lyrics.  We will
have 'singing', mostly something between typing the lyrics in 'raw' and
mechanical quoting of pre-typed words.  I'd like some way to perform
something like what I do with 'ctrl-p' to recall history.  I've the
pre-formatted text right there, and I can choose to edit, send, stop as I
wish.  Any ideas on how I can pull this off?

While it doesn't really effect anything, I found that a bit interesting.
I'm on a 486/dx2 50, running linux and tf4b2. Like I said, it doesn't 
reallly effect anything for me, but I thought I should let you know just in 
case it my be a symptom of something else.

Lo.

I've just scanned /waaaay/ down the CHANGES file (I was bored) and
noticed that since the days of Tiny{War,Talk}, TinyFugue has never been
out of alpha or beta.

Now me, I like the fact that there are always new features to play with,
etc etc.  But are there any plans to stabilise sometime soon?  It would
be kinda nice to pick up a GNU/Linux distribution and find tinyfugue
already on there.  And hey, some of the commercial OS vendors might
stick it in their unsupported-but-we-provide-compiled-versions freeware
collections!

Just a thought.  Or have I missed some vital announcement in the months
I wasn't in a position to be subscribed to this list?

Thanks.

Since I work on TF just for the fun of it, I sometimes skimp on the parts
that aren't fun, namely thorough testing and documentation.  And, instead
of hassling with multiple development branches, I've always added new
features and fixed old bugs in the same code, so most releases have had
new not-thoroughly-tested code in them.

This has changed.

You may have noticed that since 4.0 beta 1, the releases have contained
only fixes, no new features.  After the last 4.0 alpha, I split tf into
stable and development branches.  So, the 4.0 branch is becoming
increasingly stable, and I plan on making a better-than-beta (I'm still
trying to decide what to call it) release of 4.0 in the not-too-distant
future.  Meanwhile, I'm adding some major new features to the development
branch (tentatively labeled 5.0).

In the past, TF's version numbering, particularly its 'alpha' and 'beta'
status, has not been terribly consistent.  There have been alphas that
were more stable than some betas.  And while IMO most releases have not
been stable enough to go above beta, IMO the same is true of a lot of
so-called 'release' level software out there; I guess some vendors just
have lower standards.

BTW, TF's apparent 'unstable' status hasn't stopped it from being included
in software distributions.  I know for a fact that it's been published on
Red Hat and Debian Linux CDs, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it
elsewhere.

Not lower standards, just larger organizations.  The difference between
beta and leading-edge (bleeding-edge) production is that beta is shipped
to a limited number of customers who are then given a shortcut around the
usual support organization to report problems and get help.  The
leading-edge production release usually still has a lot of bugs but now a
support organization is involved so the paying customer gets to experience
the wait-in-queue and poor quality of first-level help that most vendors
make available.  Some organizations immediately escalate problems called
in against leading-edge releases, but only if the user describes the
problem in such a way that it becomes obvious that it's associated with
the new release -- new features, for example, auto-escalate. 


I have often referred to these releases as gamma.  Not quite out of beta,
not really ready for production, but you have to get it out the door or
your competitor will kill you!!

Since Ken does this on his own and makes all releases generally available
to anyone and handles all the development as well as all the support,
there's technically no difference between beta and production.  I guess if
we ever start paying for TF things might change but, since it's a labor of
love, I personally don't care what Ken calls it or how he numbers the
relases.

Keep on fuguein',

In newer versions of tf, use this:

; Syntax: /ql file line_number
;
; Puts line line_number from file into the input buffer
;
/def -i ql = \
  /let _handle=$[tfopen({1}, "r")]%;\
  /let _line_number=%2%;\
  /let _line=%;\
  /while (tfread(_handle, _line) != -1 & --_line_number) /done%;\
  /input %_line%;\
  /test kbgoto(0)

If you specify a line that is outside the range of lines in the file, the
last line will be used.

What you are trying to do won't work, becayse (if my understanding of this
is correct) adding a trigger that matches a line tinyfugue is currently
processing will not add that trigger to the list to check against. 

For example:

/def -t'foo' temp = /def -n1 -t'bar' temp2 = /echo baz

/trigger foo
/trigger bar
baz

/trigger foo bar
<nothing>
/trigger bar
baz

Fortunately, what you are trying to do can be accomplished in a couple triggers with better use of regexps:

/def -F -P1u -t' ((hit|stab|bruise|scrape|brush|cut|jab|slice|pierce|impale|cleave|slash)( (very|rather|wide))?( (hard|deeply|open|completely))?)( |$)' youhit

/def -F -P1r -t' ((hit|stab|bruise|scrape|brush|cut|jab|slice|pierce|impale|cleave|slash)e?s( (very|rather|wide))?( (hard|deeply|open|completely))?)( |$)' otherhit

Your terminal settings might not be, however. I can't think of why this
would happen off-hand but a few things you could check:

your TERM setting
settings for your terminal emulator (xterm, rxvt, or whatever) you can get
menus on an xterm by pressing ctrl+a mouse button somewhere in the window.
your xmodmap settings

There is no highly efficient way to do this unless you have better
criteria for these highlights, so if you want to for example highlight all
"says: " you might use:

/def -P0h -t'^[A-z -]+ says:' say_highlight

Actually, the new trigger macro is added immediately (macro deletions
are also applied immediately).  The question is, at what point in the
list?  If the new trigger has higher priority than the calling trigger,
it won't be tested.  If the new trigger has lower priority, it will be
tested.  But, the priority rules (in "/help priority") don't specify
the order of testing of two fall-thru triggers with the same priority,
as in the example above, so their behavior is unpredictable.  They can
be fixed by making "youhit" and "otherhit" higher priority than "l1"
and "l2".

How feasible would it be for -P to accept L & R for equivalents to %PL
and %PR and also for /def to accept more than one -P ?

Assuming multiple -P options are infeasible, but -PLxxx isn't, which
would be more efficient (in terms of speed) out of:
 a) /def -P0h -mregexp -t'^[A-z -]+ says:' say_highlight
 b) /def -PLh -F -msimple -t' says:' say_highlight1
    /def -P0h -msimple -t' says:' say_highlight2

I know, two questions, neither of which helps the original poster ...

I asked this some while ago but lost my internet access shortly after so I
never saw ther replies:


I have a regexp trigger,
/def -mregexp -t"^You tell ([^ ]+) "

and I would like to exclude something from the pattern, like
"You tell the group <...>"

Right now, I have an if command in the body. I think it's much better to
change the regexp to exclude it from the match, if possible. Could anyone
help me out?

Thanks,

Duckie

Well this is probably caused by your TERM settings...

When in console you probably have TERM=linux
and when in X ( xterm / rxvt ) you have TERM=xterm or TERM=vt102

IF you set the TERM to say vt102 in bouth cases, the same should be
generated, the vt102 is kinda good since it works well in bouth console
and rxvt/xterm. I whould make separate 2 sets of bindings though, one
for console and one for X.

While I'm at it, does any one have the slightest idea of how I can read
a
unix enviroment variable from inside TF? Say I like to use some
enviroment
variable to controle what to load and not at start up, how can I read
the
variable?

tf always only triggers on single lines. 
But of course you can set variables or define the trigger for the next 
line in the trigger that matches the first one. 
Please try to explain a bit better what exactly you want with this trigger,
then we can try to help ...

> You tell Franek Nice to see you
> You tell Zosia Nice to see you
> You tell Jozek Nice to see you

The easiest solution that comes into my mind at the moment would mean to type
"/Heya Nice to see you : Janek Franek Zosia Jozek" :
/def Heya = \
    /let text=%;\
    /while (({#}>0)&({1}!~":")) \
        /let text=%{text} %{1}%;\
        /shift 1 %;\
    /done %;\
    /shift 1 %;\
    /if ({#}=0) \
        /echo -e %% usage: /Heya <text> : <addressants> %;\
        /break %;\
    /endif %;\
    /while ({#}>0) \
        tell %{1} %{text} %;\
        /shift 1%;\
    /done

> It'll be useful not only for tells of course

Then you either need different tf-commands for different mu*-commands,
or you need to split the command line again like I did already to split
between the list of addressants and the tell text.

You are touching a problematic point here. Tinyfugue distinguishes the
commands by their names - and if you give the same name to all these
commands, only the last definition will be kept.
But there are ways to get around it. For example you could define

/def jedz = /${world_name}_jedz
/def -wworld1 world1_jedz = c san
/def -wworld2 world2_jedz = sl
/def -wworld3 world3_jedz = say Hiya

I worked on multiplayer-code like that during the last weeks (creating
new versions of /def, /undef, /edit, /reedit, /save and a command to
create the "jedz"-like command, and a new version of alias.tf) which
helps working with such kinds of commands. In case you are interested,
write a short mail ...

I think with the set of world-dependent commands from 3. the problem should
be fixed, except if you use /quote or /repeat commands, in this case use
the -w switch there.

/def -mglob -t"to the * : Train Monitor" walkTo_TrainMonitor = /dopath %3

only triggers "to the east : ...", but not "Far to the east...".
Btw, it's a good thing always to name your macros, then you can redefine
them by again defining a macro with this name, and the old version does
not spoil everything because it triggers too.
If you want you can add a -F flag to the trigger, then it tests other
triggers even if this trigger did match.


I hope I could help you a bit, feel free to ask more :-)

Hm, this would remove all other colors from the text, but you could try
something like

/def -p1 -mregexp -t'You glow (bright |slightly |)([A-Za-z])\.' trig01 =
    /substitute -p You glow %{P1}@{C%{P2}}%{P2}

I had to complicate your trigger a bit in order to remove the fullstop
from the color command. I'm sure there are better solutions, but this
one seems to work.

   Me agin ... :)
 I send a message to ask you how can i hilite text for the start of a line
to a certain word and i haven't got a good answer ... but a new mail gave
me un idea and it's working :)
 What i want to know is witch of the next formes works faster :
/def -P1h -t'^([A-Za-z_]+ tells you:) ' hilite1
/def -mregexp -t' (tells you:) ' hillite2 = /substitute -p\
 @{h}%{PL}%{P1}@{xn}%{PR}

  I have also a second question to ask ...
 you notice that the last part of the message in second def(%{PR}) will be
printed normal , what i want to know is what happens if instate of @{xn} i
would put just @{n} ... in help sais that the now attr will be combined with
the old attr of the text but normal and hilite are can't be combined so i am
wandered what would be the result of the below trigers :
/def -p10 -P1h -t' (killed) ' hil1 
/def -p5 -mregexp -t' (says:)' hil2 = /substitute -p\
 @{h}%{PL}%{P1}@{n}%{PR}

 and the text which come from socket would be :
The orc says: you killed the wizard!
  
 A last question : How can i keep hilited the words that are already
hilited in %{PR} of message and the rest of the words to remain normal ?

                                          Thanks , Archie !

This is very cool! Leads to exciting possibilities for processing the
current line with more /defs, thank you for pointing it out.

I'm already considering some sort of argument to -P to cover the
unmatched left and right ends of the string.  If they don't allow
multiple -P options, then a single -P option probably will allow a
range, so the attributes could cover an unmatched and a matched part.

>     /def -P0h -msimple -t' says:' say_highlight2

The range option I mentioned above would handle this.  I haven't decided
on a syntax yet, but just for illustration, it might be something like this:

  /def -P(L-0)h -mregexp -t' says:' say_highlight

(BTW, your -msimple wouldn't have worked.  -P only works with -mregexp, and
simple triggers don't match _part_ of a line.)

There's no way to do that in a single regexp.

Your /if is probably the best way to do it.  Another way is to block it
with a higher priority non-fall-thru trigger on "^You tell the group",
but that may block other triggers you don't want blocked.

All environment variables are automatically imported to tf when it starts,
as if they were set with /setenv.

Okay, normally my %emulation is set to ansi_attr.  Which works fine, and
/recall obviously keeps the records, since it recalls all text with the
colours the world sends.

/log doesn't write these colours.  I've tried /log after setting
%emulation to raw.  I've tried relog.tf's /relog, which didn't store the
colours, tried with %emulation on both raw and ansi_attr.  Though
/relog's fwrite() implementation does happen to strip off leading
white-space, messing up a few bits (perhaps a bug?)

What am I missing?  Is there a /help page I've missed / forgotten about
(AARGH!! I've been using tinyfugue for over three years... I feel old
suddenly) ?  What should I do (in future) to recall into a log ALL text
from a world, including ANSI escapes?

Thanks:
 a) for any help;
 b) to Ken Keys for mainataining tinyfugue and implementing so many
 feature requests  (makes you think ... six years according to /version)

Umm... How do you manage that?
To me TF isn't really usable without "/visual off" and "/set emulation=raw"
since it strips stuff to be able to do "/visual on" even when you're
in "/visual off" mode (stuff like clear screen, xterm codes, etc gets killed).

For this reason I always run in "raw" mode, and if I do "/log bar" and
do something which has colors in it and then "/log off", I then "cat bar"
in a color xterm at my unix prompt and get the colors correct. It's been
like this for as long as I can remember, and I've used TF for years.

"raw" mode logging works. If it doesn't for you, you have another problem
of some sort.

Before you all ask, don't expect 5.0 for _at_least_ several months.

Greetings,

This is my first post here, so excuse me if I'm knocking on an open door:

I have, here at CIUMix, Portugal (http://ciumix.ci.uminho.pt), a couple of
systems available to our users, namely a Sun Enterprise 3000 running Solaris
2.6 and a Data General AV2000 running DG/UX R4.20MU02.
We have a long history with supporting TinyFugue here, because most of our
users like and use it as their favourite MUD/MOO client, and it's "no-brain"
tool to any sysadmin.

The problem is that, with our last upgrade, (when we got the above systems),
we made TF available by compiling and instaling it the usual (and documented
way), and we started noticing that it "eats" all our CPU time like it never
did before... equally in both systems.. so I guess this is not an OS issue..
more over I also guess it's not a version issue, because we compiled 2 or 3
different versions of the program and watched the same results.

Is there something I should know ?
Ask away for what you will for anything that may help solve the problem..

TIA

Did you install with any of the defaults changed (e.g., did you change
anything in unix/Config, or put anything in %TFLIBDIR/local.tf)?

Does it happen even when you start with "tf -f", so you don't load your
personal files?

When it happens, does "/ps" in tf show anything running?

Ken,

TF do use alot of CPU power compared to many other clients...
Granted this should bew no problem since most systems have
ALOT of CPU power now. I run a Linux Workstation with limited
power it's a P100 with 64Mb memory and a rather normal gfx card.

On this system running my configration with alot of substitutes and
partial hilights it's a slow mother' scrolling and such... The same config
on a PPro 200 system with avrage 30 users and 2 Muds running is blistreing
fast. I don't know if it's my way of makeing hilights that is rather badly done.

But, with a P100 running Linux it's slow...

hiya 

i am new on this list by a have a question for you:
how can i adjust the colors ?
let me be more specific:

     my tf is set that the colors are white on black background ( i guess
that is the implicit set ... i never modified colors ...

     but in the evening the combination black/white has too much contrast,
my eyes hurt me .... :-)
     even i work on a b/w monitor computer ... i want to set the colors
that the tinyfugue writes with ... let's say green on blue for example ...
what i meen is that on every line that is written an \033[ ; m sequence or
whatever need, so i can be ok 

i hope you'll understand me 

10x

Alex.

We're running TF on a 486SX100 w/36MB RAM, w/Red Hat Linux 5.1.  No gfx card --
all connections to the box are remote.  We normally have around 7-10 very
active TF sessions running among our users, connecting to various local and
remote muds, with a heckuva lot of colors, triggers, send hooks, etc. (I've
written all the stuff for our system and it's extensive).  And TF runs fine.
I've never had any complaints of anyone even noticing it being slow.  If I ever
have a slow connection, it's always due to net lag, not TF.

And we're also running a mud as well as the normal services (apache, sshd, ftpd,
etc).

I've never seen tf use more than a fraction of a percentage of CPU
time, EXCEPT on occasions where I get disconnected badly (I've yet to
figure out the details).  In those cases, it will bog the system down,
using 90% plus.

If anyone's really curious, this is all I know so far:
I'll be mudding away just fine, then hit a control-key (while looking
for ^w or ^u or another), and hit one that causes tf to lock up cold
-- ^s, ^q, ^c, ^z, nothing. I have to kill the session from another
login.  Sorry that's all I know -- it's only happened 3 or 4 times in
... many years.  I'm using 3.5b4 (on that account).

We're also using 4.0b2... I know my TF code isn't nearly as efficient as it
could be, so yeah, I'd look around some outside of TF for your problem.

Yeah, tf used to start racing when it suddenly lost standard input.
I think it locked itself in a terrible loop in that case.
However I haven't seen this behaviour recently, so it might be fixed ;-)

If you're using a black and white (1 bit) monochrome display, there is no
way you can adjust the colours with software; everything will either be
"black" or "white".  Your only recourse in this situation is to fiddle with
the monitor's brightness and contrast controls (I often turn my brightness
down at night too).

If you have a colour or n-bit monochrome monitor (n>1), you could also
play with the xterm colours you use (assuming you use xterms).  Personally,
I use -fg LightSkyBlue1 -bg black, which is a bit easier on the eyes than
stark black and white.

As for adjusting colours of all text with TF, you can do this:

/def -Fq -p1000 -aC<colour> -mglob -t'*' colour_all

Take a look at /help colour for a listing of what colours you can use.

All this is assuming, of course, that you are using a terminal that supports
colour.  If it does, /help colour should show up in multiple hilites and
colours.

 I don't realy think that tf is such a hog.
On my system, a normal Sun server, dual processor with 512Mb RAM.. and

Well, I've used tf in xterm, rxvt and currently on a Linux VT.  Wit
/visual on and %emulation set to ansi_attr.  It works fine.  If I set
%emulation to raw, then I get some unusal behaviour... things like my
%prompt getting indented arbitrarily and /recall not interpreting ansi
%escapes but instead converting the escape to a printable character and
%then sending the lot -- ugly.

I've used tf for a while, and had problems, which've been fixed.  But
I've found the ansi stuff to work pretty well, as long as not on weird
terminals like ADMs (long story).

It works, insofar as I can then view the logs.  But /recall is than not
pleasant.  And as I /recall far more often than I /log, that's more
important to me.  If I switch to raw mode, then anything received after
that point is logged with ansi sequences, but previously received text
loses ansi.  Hence my question.

Any other ideas, ppl?

Assuming that you do not want to go back to previous lines in the song,
this could be pulled off using kbstack.tf and some code. (You need perl
for this.)

/require -q kbstack.tf

;;; Syntax: /load_song <song_file>
;;;
;;; Loads a song into the keyboard stack for access with ESC-UP
;;;
/def load_song = \
  /quote -S /~load_song !cat %1 | perl -e 'print reverse <>'

/def ~load_song = \
  /let _line=%*%;\
  /if ( _line !~ "" ) \
    /set _kb_stack_top=$[_kb_stack_top + 1]%;\
    /set _kb_stack_%{_kb_stack_top}=%{_line}%;\
  /endif


Enjoy

This drove me nuts till I figured out what I was doing. On some terminals
CTRL-S is bound to stop the terminal, and you then have to press CTRL-Q to
restart the flow to the terminal. You can disable this thusly in your
.login or whatever:


stty start ^@ stop ^@


Hope that helps.

A good point, but I don't believe that I'm hitting ^S, as I've tried
^Q to restart, but it doesn't work.   If I get extra bored one of
these days I'll experiment :)

> :-)

For those of you who don't know, a solution for N pieces takes pow(2,N) - 1
moves, so 20 pieces would take over 1 million moves (which I estimate would
take about 47 minutes on my machine), and 30 pieces would take over 1
billion moves (a little over a month on my machine, if it had enough
memory).  Assuming you used the /hanoi in the standard hanoi.tf, the
recursion depth would only reach N+2 (i.e., 22 or 32), well under the
default %max_recur value, so TF would never automatically abort it even
though it takes a very long time.

Of course, /hanoi or any other macro can be killed with an interrupt signal
(^C), which always kills any running macros, and gives you the option of
continuing TF, exiting TF, setting borg=off, or killing quote/repeat
processes.

yeap, this is true and i allready new that hanoi is pow(2) recursive ...

anyway ...i have to thanks to Karen for the solution with colors ... with
some changes i guess it will work great .... 

i have now another problem:
i want to make a trigger witch will execute a macro, but the macro name is
not known before trigger execution 

exemple:

/def <blah blah ... > -t'SIGN ON:' welcome = /eval /welc${world-name}%3

or something like that ... what is the problem ? if the macro is not
defined ... there is a message "macro not defined" ... how can i get rid
of that message but only here ( i meen if other macro is not defined ...
but in other part that message i want to appear )

thank you 

( poor english ... ? well ... hope i'll learn it some time ... )

I haven't been following this discussion (and I know this comment
doesn't relate to the line quoted above), but I'd like to point out
that the non-recursive solution to Hanoi is much simpler than the
other one (even though it's more difficult to understand). The problem
is still NP, of course.

How can I make a trigger that will say catch anything
that that has a name and then shouts: blah after it.
So in an example "blah shouts: this is cool" I want to be able to catch
the line.  but if I was to receive something like "blah says: blah
shouts: way to go"
then I want it to not catch it.

Thanks , Kairo

I use this for colouring of all the text before the actual shout. With the
colouring part removed, it looks like this. 

/def -mregexp -Fp0 -t'^([A-Za-z ]*) shouts: ' shout_catch = /<foo> %PR

%PR is everything right of "shouts: ", and that's the text you want, if I
didn't misunderstand you. 

If you want the "Foo shouts: " part as well, I guess there might be a
variable similar to %PR as well, though I'm not sure.

I am wanting to make a bot for questing on god wars type muds
The problem is that I'm not sure how to make tf just activate on the first
pattern it sees on the card and not to activate triggers for the 2nd 3rd
and 4th items on the quest card

The cards are layout in the following manner :
You still need to find:
	item 1
	item 2
	item 3
	item 4

How could this be done?

/def -mregexp -t"^([A-Za-z]*) say:" yousay = /test
substitute(strcat({P0},{PR}))
so like "tom says: hello" this whole thing appears in yellow
is there a way to change just the text after the ":" into a different
color ?
In the above trigger P0 captures everything including the colon.
PR contains everything else after the colon
and it only searches from the start of the line.

All lines must be compared against the regexp, but only the ones that match
invoke the macro body.  Assuming most lines _don't_ match, efficiency depends
more on the regexp than on the macro body.

That said, I don't actually know which regexp is more efficient.  The first
is more precise, however; the second may match a line like

  Hawkeye says, "this 'tells you:' will break your second macro."

which you probably don't want.

Also, to handle names containing punctuation, change "[A-Za-z]" to "[^ ]".

This one seems to catch "   LT:" but then drops the spaces I need
to find out how to make it so it dont drop the spaces.

Also if the line wraps say 2 or 3 lines only the first line
is in grey, how can I make it so it stays grey until another
ansi code comes in ?

I have tf 4.0 and I'm interested how to organize such thing :
grabbing some texts from the screens like tells, gtells and
pileing them in a file.
What command should organize that ?
For example triggered lines "*tells you* I want to collect in a
file.
Kind of irclog but not for all the mud history - where i may use
/log.
And how to get back to the mud after command /writefile.
I know now only about Ctrl+C and then P - stupid way as you can
see :)

Like this:

/def -mregexp -t'^You still need to find:' item_list_start_trig = \
  /def -n1 -mglob -t'*' first_item_needed_trig = \
    /do_whatever_you_need %*

%* to list the whole item 1 line, or %1 for "item" and %2 for "1" etc.

Yes, see /help substitute on how to use inline attributes, but you don't
need it here.

/def -mregexp -P1Cyellow -t'^[A-Za-z]+ say: (.+)" yousay

Will do what you want if I understood you correctly.

If there's more than one item (as above), then this'll only catch the
first one. Catching the rest is more difficult -- how do you know when
to stop?  Maybe you could have a macro that sends two commands:
1) the one that lists the above information ("You still need to
   find...")
2) A command with known output.

You can set up a macro similar to Rafael's above, but without the -n1.
Set up a trigger on the output of #2 above to /undef the first macro.

It drops the spaces because you are using the command form of substitute,
which distinguishes parameters based on spaces between them, so leading
spaces don't make much difference, do they. char(32) won't help you :P
 
/def -mregexp -F -t'^ +LT: ' 3klinktell = \
  /test substitute(strcat({P0},"@{C8}",{PR}),,1)

see /help substitute on the function form.

When tf wraps a line, attributes work just fine. But tf cannot know when
your server wraps a line, they look exactly like separate lines to it,
and they are. If your server has a line wrapping option turn it off.

see /help tfio and /help textutil

Some functions like this:

/def open_log = \
  /set %1_log = $[tfopen(strcat({1},".log"),"a")]

;;; /log_line(handle,text)

  /open_log tells

/def -F -hDISCONNECT end_tell_log = \

Open a file for writing with tfopen(), and save its handle.
Make a trigger on the desired lines, which does /test tfwrite(handle, {*}).

> And how to get back to the mud after command /writefile.

The 'P' is unneccessary; no process (/repeat or /quote) is involved.
'C' (continue tf) works just as well.

The problem is that there's no way to indicate the end of input when
tfread() is reading from the keyboard.  For now, ^C is the only way,
and it interrupts the entire macro, not just the read.  So, when using
tfread(), you need to either provide another way to break the loop
(e.g., typing "/endpaste" during /paste), or just don't use it with
input from the keyboard.  /writefile is intended to be used with 
tfin from a pipe; e.g.,

  /eval /list <options> %| /writefile [-a] <file>

is nearly identical to

  /save [-a] <file> <options>

It's an artifact of doing decimal floating-point arithmetic on a binary
computer.  The simple program

  main() { printf("%.14f\n", 99.4); }

will give the same result.

But you'll be happy to know that TF 5.0 (not available yet, don't ask)
actually uses fixed-point arithmetic for numbers with up to 6 decimal
places, so it won't lose precision.  (This is really a side effect of
5.0 measuring time with microsecond resolution, another feature I know
many of you will like.)

What system time does the TF clock in the lower right corner calibrate
itself to? Does it matter if it's the Win95 version compiled by Andy Satori?

I ask, because I've noticed that it seems to be exactly one hour off the
Win95 Tray clock on my machine. I'm wondering if it actually goes by the
system time of the game being played (the main MUSH I play at is in a
different time zone) instead of the system time of the machine running it?

Or, is there possibly some configuration glitch somewhere I don't know about?

Cygwin seems to think Daylight Saving Time ended a month earlier than
it really did.  Presumably the time will be correct again when DST really
ends this weekend.

What are the odds of a rewrite where TinyFugue runs 'as is' whether run in
Linux or in MS-DOS Console mode after it is directly compiled?  No Cygwin
in the middle?  An example of this would be the 'loadmuck' program I use
at http://www.otterspace.com/~nameless/tools.html.  The two different
platform versions stay in step and there is no Cygwin to fight with in the
middle.

It's possible, but not really something that I (or I suspect, Ken) would 
wish to do..   Before you get all grumpy about it, let me explain why.

The first and foremost reason is that in the current implementation, TF 
relies heavily on the UNIXish assumption that File descriptors and socket 
descriptors may be used interchangeably.  On Windows this is not true, and 
the CygWin libraries implement this in a wrapper.

Now, I suspect that Ken has played with modifiying this behaviour at 
various times and I would imagine that if it's going to happen it won't 
happen until the tf 5 development tree makes it's way into the general 
public's hands.  There are many things about the CygWin kits that may 
annoy us all, but they are an effective solution and they are free.   I 
have a version of TF running under Interix, however, it's less stable than 
the CygWin build and while some things work better, Interix is a very 
pricey solution just for TF

No worries.  I'm going to _have_ to impliment cygwin to run the DOS
version of a MUCK server.  A more direct route would be 'nice', but unless
my development work for Nameless takes me into Windows, I try to stay in
Linux.  Windows expects you to have gobs of memory for the typical
bloatware application, so I don't think it's a problem.  What _I_ want for
Christmas is a decent 486 with Linux to run a mini-Lan server off of, and
I'd be tempted to run Windows for GUI, and have Linux running services.
Then my 'high-powered' Windows box can gag, spit, choke and die while I'm
in the middle of doing 'real-work' on the Linux box, and it's no big deal.
I reboot, resume my Linux screen session as if I never left.

Oh, and I _would_ be running TinyFugue, but on Linux through Telnet, not
the Cygwin version. ;)  Don't throw away those old 486 computers, ladies &
gents!  With a little work you can have the best of 'both' platforms.

Is there any particular reason tf is so sensitive about trailing spaces

Or blank lines in macro bodies?

In ansi_attr mode is there anyway to make a trigger to go off
when a certain color comes in ?

Also in this same mode can I change the color say I trigger
off yellow coming in, can I change displayed text to say red.

So far I can only do this in raw mode.  but the cygwin32 ansi color
emulation sucks.  I played around with it and it does color emulation
but you have to send the codes exactly. like <esc>[5m sets flashing
then say you send <esc>[1;31m to set red, the cygwin32 ansi color
emulation wont flash the red unless you send it as <esc>[5;31m
so as you can see the emulation for cygwin32 has a long ways to go
in that area. so I am avoding raw mode because of that.

tfopen does not require textutil.tf
tfopen returns an integer. Gotta store this on a variable, to use it as
handle, for example:

/set testText $[tfopen("~/tinyfugue/test.txt","a")]
If you try this from the command prompt, put /eval in front of it ;) Or
/set sub full, I think.

you can now write to the file with for example:
/test tfwrite({testText}, "blah") %;\

and close the file with:
/test tfclose({testText})

Reading from a file for example:
/set testTextRead $[tfopen("~/tinyfugue/test.txt","r") %;\
/while (%{returnRead} != -1) \
       /set returnRead $[tfread({testTextRead}, textLine)] %;\
       /echo %{textLine} %;\
/done %;\
/test tfclose({testTextRead})

This will, however, read the lst line twice. Maybe someone else has a
better sollution. I don't like texutils.tf btw ;P

I'm logging some stuff as well, and I have a few questions now.

I log messages only if I am away from keyboard. What should I do, leave
the file handle open all the time, or open it when I go AFK, or open and
close it on each message...

I didn't see a tfopen mode for both read and write (like fstream in c++)
so I assume there isn't any? I just open the file twice now, one handle
for reading and one for writing. Any unwanted side affects with that
method?

Can someone give me an example how to use wc -l <handle> and store the
number of lines in a variable? I cant get it to work.

Thanks,
Duckie.

Most of my files are loaded from .tfrc - there are commands
handling that. But... often when i make some changes and load
that files second time nothing changes - I have to /quit tf and
then get back. 
What's wrong - is it  a fault of tf or just my terminal.

*Shrugs helplessly*

I do that all the time, and works fine. You *did* save the file first,
didn't you? ;)

Oh... if you don't give your macros names, problems like yours could
arise. A trigger like

/def -t"Some text to react on" = /reaction

will work fine, but after changing the trigger in a file and reloading, tf
does *not* replace the trigger, but creates a new trigger while the old
trigger remains active. From /help priority:

>If there is more than one of the highest priority, one of those is chosen
at random.<

So if you don't name your trigger, and reload it, there's no way of
knowing which trigger tf will use.

If you give your macros  names, however, the old one will be replaced by
the new one. I would recommend to name your macros *always*.

Correct.  (I'll assume you meant "synchronous", not "asynchronous").
I personally set my ptime=0.1 now; it's fast enough to be less annoying
than 1 second, but not as dangerous as 0 seconds if something goes wrong.

No.  Only the text is compared to triggers.

You can convert _all_ yellow to red by making tf emit the red code
when it wants to display yellow (i.e. "/set start_color_yellow=\033[31m").
But there's no way to do it only for one particular text pattern.

I always recommend avoiding emulation=raw.  But emulation=ansi_attr
wouldn't help with the cygwin problem as you described it (I haven't
tried it myself).  In that mode, TF can understand any combined codes
(e.g., "\033[1;5;31m") sent by the server, but it always prints them
to the terminal separately (e.g., "\033[1m\033[5m\033[31m").

Well, I wouldn't know from a side-by-side comparasin, I don't know of any
statistics work done on it.  But I figure TinyFugue should kick-tail on
any MUD for someone who knows what they are doing.  I would _expect_ it to
work even better than Z-Mud for that.  I'm curious to hear on opinions
about that.

Yes, that's one reason for the development of 'loadmuck', one of the tools
we are using for NamelessMUCK development
(http://www.otterspace.com/~nameless).  loadmuck has some other scripting
benefits, but synchronous quoting (thank you for the correction) vs. once
a second quoting was the driving force behind it.

I want you to advice how to organize such a thing (or maybe
somebody coded that or similiar thing and could help with a
file):
Automatical exploring of whole area : Area has habits :
1. no doors, no secret passages, just clear doors between rooms,
no exits from the area - cant exit from there just maching
2. Explring takes till trigger in one of the rooms.
3. Can't map the area because it's changed every reboot.

Well - if somebody coded that, similar things please - contact
me. :) I'm interested even in a whole idea of course.
I simply can't organize that because I'm not able to match
explored rooms and build kind of a map directing me to new ones.

I've written a Java MUD/MOO/talker thing, and one of the things it does is
automatically detect terminal types.  This is fine for telnet, but doesn't
work when the person is using tinyfugue.  I've had a looksee at the code,
and I'm fairly confident I can add telnet TTYPE support in, but I'm a
little unsure about the procedure for doing so (or if it's even allowed).  
Can I just do it and send Ken (?) the patches, or do I need to check with
people first? (I don't really feel like doing it and having it rejected.
;)

Also, I'm not sure what terminal types tinyfugue should be responding
with.  We can supply a list of them - the linux console might (I forget,
exactly) return types like 'linux', 'ansi', 'vt320', and 'dumb'.  The idea
is to go from most specific to least specific.  I was thinking of having
tinyfugue start with 'tiny' or 'tf' or something, and then go to 'ansi'
(since it seems to accept and convert ansi codes depending upon which
terminal you're on).

The advantage of telling the server that it's tinyfugue is then we know
other things about the client, like that it's okay to use IACGA or
whatnot.

Oh, the server is available at:
http://realm.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~subtle/key

Unfortunately There are five or something like that types of
rooms and the rest (100 I think) are copies of them.
So the only possibility I see in creating kind of virtual map or
maybe something else.

Is there some way of making /set (or similar) execute a command?

This is what I got so far:
	
	/set crap=0
	/def -PCgreen -mregexp -t'I wanna get triggered' trigger_me = \
        /result crap + 1

What I need is to have the result from the /result command set into the
variable "crap"
so that whenever "I wanna get triggered" comes up crap grows by 1.

/set crap=0
/def -PCgreen -mregexp -t'I wanna get triggered' trigger_me = \
	/set crap=$[crap + 1]

Or is it not as simple as I think?

Or even better, make that last line
      /test crap := crap + 1
or just
      /test ++crap

There's not a huge difference, but it's always a little better to use
an assignment expression instead of a /set and $[].  This will be even
more true in version 5.0.  And, $[] is just uglier looking than a pure
expression. :)

Hiya all, I'd like help with a code bit I'd like to make, but I'm not even
sure where to begin.  I'd like to implement an auto-rearranger for a MUD I
play on, similar to zMUD ones I have seen in use.  The MUD gives you a
random set of stats based on your order of importance, and asks if you want
to save it.  If not, it does it again, ad infinitum.  Each stat ranges from
1 to 20, with an anomaly at 18, where it goes into 18, 18(10),
18(20)...18(100), 19, 20.  Each race has different maximums as well,
ranging from 18(50) to 20 in each stat.

I'd like to be able to have a rearranger that you give it your maximum
intelligence, and it will keep rolling until it comes up with a roll with
intelligence at maximum, and strength and con both at at least 18(10).
Neither of those will go over 18(60), as they are not designated the prime
stat, I hope that makes it easier.  This is what the MUD spits out each
time you hit enter:


Generating re-roll!
These are the random stats generated for your character.  Are they acceptable?
   Intelligence : 18(20)
       Strength : 18
   Constitution : 12
      Dexterity : 9
         Wisdom : 8
Pressing <enter>, by itself will cause a re-roll.
Entering 'q' or 'quit' will exit rearrange without saving.
Entering any other key will save this roll.


As you can see, the three stats are all on different lines, and I don't
know how to deal with this.  The closest I have come to is is these 2
triggers, assuming my Int maximum is at 18(90):

/def -p2 -t'*Intelligence : 18(90)' blah = /beep
/def -t'*Intelligence : *' blah2 = /send

That's the limit of my abilities, I'd like to see what other people can
come up with.  C'mon, you can do it if zMUD can, right?  :)

How about just:
/def -t'*Intelligence : *' blah2 = /send
/def -p2 -t'*Intelligence : 18(90)' blah = \
	/def -p2 -t'*Strength : 18(10)' strength1 = \
		/def -p2 -t'*Constitution : 18(10)' const1 = \
			/beep %%;
		/def -t'*Constitution : *' const2 = \
			/send %;
	/def -t'*Strength : *' strength2 = \
		/send

That's ofcourse proveded that they will always come in the order
intelligence, strength, constitution. I don't know, but I think that
should work.

Actually, this would only work for Str & Con being 18(10) and not higher.
Also, the triggers for Str & Con will stay, so that if you've recieved Int
18(90) and Str 18(10) one time (but not Con 18(10)), any later appearance
of Con 18(10) will cause the client to /beep. 

I suggest using regexps and if-statements for Con & Str, like this: 

  /def -1 -p2 -mregexp -t'Strength : 18\(([0-9]??)\)' str =\
    /if (%P1 >= 10) \
      /def -1 -p2 -mregexp -t'Constitution : 18\(([0-9]??)\)' con =\
	/if (%%P1 >= 10) /beep%%;\
	/else /send%%;
    /else /send%;

Although, I have not tried this, I think it should work. I might have
gotten some of the %%'s wrong though. (I wish they could be replaced with
{}-brackets instead, just like in C. :)

Well, try it, but I suggest you do it when no Admin of that mud is
watching, unless you're allowed to use triggers for whatever you want. :)

Ack! Yes...Very true. DOH! Your solution:

Umm... This wont work either, I'm affraid. The trigger is not set off unless
these things reach exactly 18 (xx) and that might not happen so your "-1"
wont help. The /if can be killed in favor of changed regexp, also...
Let me try again, combining out efforts:

/def -t'*Intelligence : *' blah2 = /send
/def -p2 -t'*Intelligence : 18(90)' blah = \
  /def -1 -p2 -mregexp -t'Strength : *18\([1-9].\)' strength1 = \
    /undef strength2 %%;
    /def -1 -p2 -mregexp -t'Constitution : *18\([1-9].\)' const1 = \
      /beep %%%; /undef const2 %%;
    /def -1 -t'*Constitution : *' const2 = \
      /send %%%; /undef const1 %;
  /def -1 -t'*Strength : *' strength2 = \
    /send %%; /undef strength1


Now... does this look like it could work? :-)

TF emulates only a subset of vt100/ansi terminal functions (specifically,
display attributes), so it would be incorrect to respond with "DEC-VT100" or
"ANSI".  If it did, servers might decide it's safe to send cursor motion
codes, etc.  I'm considering inventing and using a nonstandard (non RFC
1700) name, "ANSI-ATTR", which means the NVT supports the display attribute
subset of an ANSI terminal (i.e. sequences of ESC, '[', digits and
semicolons, and 'm').

True, although it's not really the right way to do it.  Maybe I'll make
it send "TINYFUGUE" first, then "ANSI-ATTR".

As far as IAC GA is concerned, it should be safe to send to any client that
supports telnet protocol, which you can identify as soon as the client
answers any telnet option negotiation.  Only TF and a few others will
recognize the IAC GA as a prompt terminator, but any other client that
supports telnet protocol should handle it gracefully.  Or, you could use the
more robust IAC END-OF-RECORD method, which must be negotiated first.

  Hello , i have
  I want to know if there is some sort of attribution operator ? like in C , 
 i mean can /set macro return a value or there is a set function ?
  I want to evaluate and modify in the same time a variable , like in C !
  If anyone has an answer please tell me about !
                                                     Thanks !

The := assignment operator in TF works just like the = assignment
operator in C:  it assigns a value to a variable, and its value is the
new value of the variable.  You just have to use it in an expression
($[...], /test..., etc.).

Well it can freeze at numerous points. Your terminal emulator might freeze
up on ctrl-s, mine does, your connection might freeze up if stty hasn't
got suspend/resume disabled, or it could even freeze the mud side (seen
one mud implement this). And after all this, it could freeze your 'screen'
if you are running tf under that software. Normally ctrl-q restarts, but
your stty settings might vary. And the screen locks up with ctrl-a 's',
and resumes with ctrl-a 'q'. Oh and your screen or terminal emulator might
send ctrl-s and ctrl-q as flowcontrolling by itself, if it's getting too
much data. You can enable this feature in screen by typing ctrl-a 'f'.

The are many places where the problem can be, but don't give up on
computers and let them control _you_ instead of you controlling them.

 I have been running verion 35a20 for some time and it works well. I wanted to upgrade to the new 40b2. After I upgrade
my tf I find that when I log into the telnet type system I get the first prompt but after I type in my loging name I dont get the
password prompt (I did try and send my password anyway) the system will end up timing out and kicking me off. Seems
as if am not sending anything to the host system.

 After that I tryed to telnet into my Linux box and it seems to work fine even tried my Linux box at work over the net.
I have tried a number of settings to make this version work without anyluck anyone have any ideas?

The host system is novalink.com/23 if someone wants to try it.

Novalink enables binary mode, but still expects CR LF end-of-line markers.
By default, TF sends LF in binary mode.  You should "/set binary_eol=CRLF"
in TF.

Anyone know if the latest beta release of cygwin beta 20 will fix some
of the
problems with TF like shell not working or pipes not working, etc.

Also is it cygwin that causes flashing to not work, I have to run a
special
dos app or run edit at the dos prompt in full screen mode, before
runinning
TF to get flashing characters to flash.  If I hit alt-enter to goto
window mode
then back the flashing is lost and all flashing characters appear on a
grey back
ground.  This is all in windows NT4.

  I play on a cyberpunk MUD and often team with other members of my guild
in order to help them boost their stats and recently decided to write some
triggers to keep track of who was teamed with me so I could automatically
calculate their split of money we had earned by selling stuff we took off
NPCs and then transfer it to them.  I found 2 libraries (ARRAY.TF &
LISTS.TF) on a web site at <http://www.ph-cip.uni-koeln.de/~dittmar/tf>
which seemed to be ideal to handle this and wrote the following triggers
using them (actually I only use the functions in LISTS.TF, but it needs
ARRAY.TF to operate):

  This one adds the new teammate to my list:

/def -p1 -F -mregexp -t'([^ ]*) joined your team.' joined = \
  /test temp:=tolower({P1})%; \
  /addlist teammates %temp%; \
  /unset temp

  This one removes players who leave the team:

/def -p1 -F -mregexp -t'([^ ]*) left your team.' left = \
  /test temp:=tolower({P1})%; \
  /remlist teammates %temp%; \
  /unset temp

  And this one keeps a running total of the amount of cash I've earned by
  selling at a shop in a var called "profit."  So far, so good.  All these
  triggers work just fine:

/def -mregexp -t'\$([^ ]*) has been deposited into your account.' profit = \
  /test profit:=profit+{P1}

  Which brings me to the problem trigger and the subject of this message.
  This trigger is supposed to calculate the amount of cash each player in
  the team (including me, of course) is due from the total profit (which it
  does properly) and then, using the foreach function in LISTS.TF, send a
  "transfer [amount] to [teammate]" command to the MUD for each member in
  the list.  The problem is that it only sends "transfer [amount] to" and I
  can't figure out why the [teammate] bit is not being added.  If anyone
  can offer me any help with this I'd sincerely appreciate it.  TIA.

/def tran = \
  /test split:=profit / (teammates__count+1)%; \
  /foreach member teammates transfer %split to %member%; \

I have noticed that tf (4.0b3) tends to crash when people disconnect
and immediately reconnect again to a world that is lagging.
Some users here have a simple macro they use when a mud gets lagged:
/def re = /disconnect myworld%;/connect myworld

Under some circumstances (30%) this crashes tinyfugue...
However when I tried to reproduce it, it won't crash ;-)
I wonder if anybody had simular behaviour. btw. we run linux-current (2.1)

Greetings,
Johan van Selst

I've already fixed this for the next version, which will be available soon.

I have observed a bug with ^G (beep) for the last few versions of TF. 

My mud sends lines such as "Xxx beeps.^G\n" (\n stands for newline). The
setting emulation=debug shows that the line is received as "Xxx beeps.\n"
and the ^G-character remains at the beginning of the input-line (/visual
on). 

If new lines of text are received before I send commands to the mud, the
^G-character seems to get included by the prompt. From now on, every new
line of text beeps ...

With 'lp=off' the ^G-character does not get included by the prompt. So TF
beeps only once per line with ^G.

I can't test where the two characters ^G and \n get exchanged - if I can
trust the sourcecode of my mud, the line is send as "Xxx beeps.^G\n". ;-)



Bye, Stephan

It's the first ever better-than-beta release of TF!  It should be quite
stable, and will probably be the last release for some time.  If you've
been waiting to upgrade, now's the time.


4.0 gamma 1 (11/10/1998)
-----------
Supports SOCKS5 in addition to SOCKS4.
/edit can delete a macro's body.
Improved prompt detection heuristics for typeless worlds.
/relog (in relog.tf) preserves leading/trailing space, and is more efficient.
Improved error messages for failed connection under SOCKS.
Improved error messages for disconnected sockets on some systems.
Avoids rounding error in displaying floating point numbers.
Refuses telnet SUPPRESS-GO-AHEAD option.
Fixed bug in using /connect in a world file; PROXY, CONNECT, or LOGIN hook;
  or %status_int_world.
Fixed fatal bug in redefining the "default" world.
Fixed fatal bug in "/recall -t" when %time_format is unset. (40a9)
Fixed: floating point exception caused crash on some systems.
Fixed zombie processes left by failed nonblocking gethostbyname on unix.
Fixed possible "Bad file number" and "crossed connections" when reconnecting
  in a DISCONNECT hook.
Fixed memory leak in expression stack overflow.

Yes in a fit of productivity, Hawkmoon the worlds laziest Web Admin not only recompiled it but has gotten the WebPage updated 
accordingly.


4.0 Gamma 1 is ready in binary form.  This is still linked against the b19 of the Cygnus tools, expect a b20 version available some 
time in the next couple of days.  It does appear to work with pipes (/sys and /quote) however, using them needs BASH installed so I 
have added a download for the user tools of the Cygnus stuff as well.

Also available is the long ago promised tf.syn syntax file for Object Edit (from the Object Desktop software package)

My friend is having a strange problem with tf 4.0 gamma 1.
He's connected to a MUX that he hasn't defined in his .tfrc, 
he just types 'tf host port' to connect.  About half an 
hour after he connects, he gets the message:

% addworld: illegal world name: (unnamed1)
% This looks like an lp-prompt world, so I'm redefining it as one.
% You should explicitly define it with the -T option of /addworld.
)

It then gave him a colon prompt.  The trailing ) was not a typo.

What's up with this?  I assume it's related to the 
"Improved prompt detection heuristics for typeless worlds"

around it by using the addworld command, but he doesn't want

You can't nest %{} (or any other substitution) inside the selector part
of another %{}.  Often you can use /eval to get around this, by nesting
%{} inside %%{}, but that doesn't work in this case because /for does
not inherit the parameters of /trig.  Using /while and /eval instead of
/for will avoid that problem.

/def deftrigs = \
    /let i=0%; \
    /while (++i <= {#}) \
        /eval \
            /def -F -mregexp -t'%%{%{i}}' tr_%{i} = \
                /set var_%{i}=%%{%{i}}%; \
    /done

BTW, "trig" is the name of a standard command, which is I picked another
name.

I haven't seen your mud's source, but tf's source and actual tests
agree:  if the ^G appears after the newline with emulation=debug, then
that is indeed what the server sent.  If the mud source doesn't seem to
agree, then you need to look at the mud source more carefully.

I know Ken doesnt like them *grin* But I've made RPMs of tf-4.0g1
available (i386, libc6 versions only - mail me if you really need libc5).

They're at:

http://www.ozemail.com.au~/chriscog/tf/

And will soom be at redhat's contrib site: ftp://contrib.redhat.com/

Note, if you see any problems with the package, mail /me/ rather than Ken.
Ken's had nothing to do with the packaging of the RPMs. Thanks.

Note that I'm following redhat's suggested convention with
alpha/beta/release versions, and calling each series with a different
package name. This means that if you're upgrading from a beta version to a
gamma version, you'll need to erase the beta version explicitely. (The
reason for this is so that a new beta version wont cause a release version
to be removed from contrib)

Okay, since my earlier message gathered no response, I'll assume 
this is perceived to be a feature and not a bug, although why 
I'm not sure.  So I will ask this:

Is there a way to:

a) turn off the automatic prompt detection for typeless worlds, 
   or have it stop checking after the first few minutes of connection?
   He's gotten this message twice, once after half an hour and 
   once after over an hour, with different prompt characters.
   I would think that if you were really connected to a prompted 
   world, you'd see a prompt sooner than that.  Since he never 
   connects to prompted worlds, disabling the feature would be a 
   satisfactory solution.

b) turn off the automatic prompt detection for undefined worlds - 
   it *can't* use /addworld on (unnamedx), so why try?  At the 
   very least, it should be handled more intelligently.

c) explicitly choose a type for undefined worlds, either by default 
   or on command?  (grasping at straws here)

Since my friend uses primarily tf to connect to test servers that 
don't stay in one place, it really is easier for him not to define 
his worlds.  So I would appreciate an answer on this before he goes 
back to using 4.0b3 in frustration.  :)

I can't figure out any other answer, but how about a workaround?  Make
up an alias that adds a world and defines it as a telnet type, then
connects to it.

At a guess,

/def nworld =
   /addworld -T"telnet" %1-%2 %1 %2 %; \
   /connect %1-%2


Additional nifty property that you then get the host-port on the
status line :)

Well, normally I don't post "me too"'s, but since there have been no
response to this, I'm making an exception.

I have the exact same problem.  There's also the fact that if I don't
define a world type in my worlds file, I honestly don't want it to have a
type.  I know this may seem illogical, but TF just doesn't "do the right
thing" with some of the servers I connect to, unless I leave it typeless.
Now I no longer have that option.

I agree that something needs to be done about this, it's quite annoying.

"Just have it work" is the whole point of the prompt detection heuristics.
When users connect to an lp-prompting world without defining a type, these
heuristics make it Just Work for them.  But, as you say, it should also
Just Work for non-prompting worlds; the heuristics which used to favor
non-prompting worlds have gotten too agressive.

I'll probably implement it this way soon.  I didn't before because the
current method is simpler, and I didn't think that the false positives
would be so common.

For now, you can disable it completely by adding this line to your .tfrc:

  /eval /if ($(/ver) =~ "4.0 gamma 1") /undef ~detect_worldtype_2%; /endif

4.0 gamma 2 will allow /addworld to REdefine any world, even "(unnamedX)",
so its type and other fields can be changed.

That's not a bad idea.  Maybe "/addworld -T<type> default"; or, a
default_world_type variable.

What type did you use?  You probably should use "tiny" or "tiny.<something>".
"tiny" and blank are treated identically, with two exceptions:

* A "tiny" world automatically sets lp=0 when you fg it; an untyped world
  leaves lp alone.  This doesn't matter if you never set lp=1.

* A "tiny" world is not subject to the type detection heuristics.

The /eval is unnecessary, so this command is better:

  /if ($(/ver) =~ "4.0 gamma 1") /undef ~detect_worldtype_2%; /endif

Yes, that's what I was trying to say... thanks.  :)

I think that would be most excellent.  You could extend that idea to 
define a default username and password, too.

One of the problems I've been up against, from time to time over the past seven years of using tinyfugue, has been the dread 'oh, no, the MU* has changed sites. Again.' syndrome.

Mind you, it's always been easy to get around, because, well, I know how to use global search and replace in vi, and nowadays, in WordPad too. But now that every world works better with a 'type' set, it's time to talk about this one again.

What I'm looking for, is a format that would enable me to enter the address for a world only once, and then symbolically represent it for all of my characters (or my family's characters, or anyone else using my computer) on that world.

Perhaps....

/addworld -t"Tiny.MUSH" VaporMUSH caisr2.caisr.cwru.edu 4250
/addchar VaporMUSH VM-Jad Jadawin mypassword
/addchar VaporMUSH VM-#1 #1 potrzebie

The kicker, is, though, that when I change the definition of VaporMUSH, I want that address
to change for all my worlds, too. I would think that would need a change in the tiny.world
format, and such would have to be evaluated every time the world was to be initialized.

Or Perhaps even a new file...tiny.world and tiny.char ? Sure would make it easier to send someone your world file, if it's got none of your characters, and none of your passwords.

Again, just requests for discussion on the topic...I'm SURE there's a way to do it all within the scripting language. :) Perhaps just read in tiny.char and make the entries into /addworld commands that are executed at startup of tf...but then you'd have to restart (or re/loadchar) whenever you changed a world definition...and lose any changes you made 'accidentally' in the old format...

Hey,

I'd like to bind the tab key to do the work of ESC-f, to cycle through my
open worlds.

Anyone know how to do that?

4.0 gamma 2 (11/15/1998)
-----------
Worlds without type or mfile now use corresponding field of "default" world.
Improved prompt detection heuristics for typeless worlds.
/addworld can reset fields other than host and port for "(unnamedN)" worlds.
Clarified scope rules in "/help /for".
Fixed fatal error when reconnecting in a DISCONNECT hook. (40g1)

I've RPM'd the latest version of tf (right on the heels of the
announcement), and is available at:

http://www.ozemail.com.au/~chriscog/tf/

and soon also at ftp://contrib.redhat.com/libc6/i386/

Again, if anybody spots something wrong with the packaging, contact me
rather than Ken. Goes for comments or suggestions, too :)

Thanks, and enjoy.

If I wanted to reverse a string, and then send it with a prefix, how would
I go about doing this?

/backwards cl Text to send

would send off:

Thanks in advance,

/help result contains a string reversal function:

    /def strrev = \
        /let len=$[strlen({*})]%; \
        /return (len <= 1) ? {*} : \
            strcat(strrev(substr({*},len/2)), strrev(substr({*},0,len/2)))

A reversal macro suitable for sending text to a mud would look something like:

/def backwards = $(/strrev %*)

and with prefix:

/def backwards = %1 $(/strrev %-1)

          ^^^^^^^

Oops, that should have been /result (so that /strrev can be called as a command
as well as a function).

Afternoon,

Quick question about what changed w.r.t hilites
in the gamma releases of tf.

I was previously running a 4.0 alpha release
under screen with colour hilites for various
purposes. (A hack in the .screenrc gave me
colour. Very useful).

I just upgraded to tf40g2 and screen now
no longer displays hilites in color, though
I can get the full range when I run outside
of it.

Anyone any ideas? I'm running screen-3.07.04,
tf40g2 on a SunOS box.

I experience similar problems.
OS: SunOS 5.5.1
screen: 3.07.04
TF: 4.0g2 (although this also happened in at least 4.0g1 and 4.0b3)

1. If I use BetterTelnet SSH (Macintosh) to connect securely to my shell
account, and then run TF inside screen, I have no colour.
2. If I use BT SSH to connect securely to my shell, and then run TF _outside_
screen, I have colour.
3. If I use BT SSH to connect non-securely (ie. vanilla telnet) to a local
host, and then use ssl telnet to connect securely to my shell, and then run
TF inside screen, I have colour!

Cases 1 and 2 sound like what you describe above.  What I don't understand is
how I can get colour inside screen, if I connect to my shell differently.
I suspect BT SSH isn't setting up the terminal identically (it is beta and
known to be buggy) as vanilla/ssl telnet does.  So is telnet correcting
terminal problems that screen is introducing?  What's going on?

PS. The lines I use in screen to get colour are:
termcap  vt100 'AF=\E[3%dm:AB=\E[4%dm'
terminfo vt100 'AF=\E[3%p1%dm:AB=\E[4%p1%dm'
termcap  vs100 AF=\E[3%dm
terminfo vs100 AF=\E[3%p1%dm
termcap  vs100 AB=\E[4%dm
terminfo vs100 AB=\E[4%p1%dm

It is possible, as long as at the end of your processing you include the
/dokey NEWLINE command. You can then get text from the input line using
the kb functions (see /help functions). Example:

/def -i do_enter = \
  /echo $[strcat(kbhead(),kbtail())]%;\
  /dokey NEWLINE

/def -i -b'^m' enter_bind1 = /do_enter
/def -i -b'^j' enter_bind2 = /do_enter

There is a minor problem with /foreach in that library, on line 227 in
lists.tf, change this line:

        /eval -s0 %{command} %;\

to

        /eval -s2 %{command} %;\

And then this should work.

This message is meant mainly for Ken, but I'm still sending it to the list
in case someone else is interested.

Tinyfugue has come to many enchancements lately, but one thing which has
stayed the same is that it still uses the same old regular expression
engine. A better regular expression engine would ease many things
considerably.

I will point here some things how they are in tinyfugue and how they are
in perl and other advanced engines:

TF			Perl		Explanation
[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]	\d{4}		match four digits
....?.?.?		.{3,6}		match three to six characters
[A-Za-z0-9_-]		\w		"word" character (locale dependant)
n/a			\b		a word boundary (zero-width)
n/a			(?:...)		expression grouping without
					creating sub variables
n/a			(?i)		case insensitive matching
\([^)]*\)		\(.*?\)		(not exactly the same, the latter
					uses non-greedy matching which is
					_very_ useful)

And some more complex examples for what is possible with regexps:
foo(?=bar)		Foo followed by bar, but not including it in {P0}
foo(?!bar)		Foo _not_ followed by bar
(?<=foo)bar		bar predeceded by foo

These are just small examples of things that are currently very nasty to
do in tf. Also, we can create every possible glob expression thru regexps
(example, "{foo|bar}" == "(?i)\b(foo|bar)\b"). Repetitions other than
?,+,*, assertions and case sensitivity are the biggest problems with
current regexps.

So, the solution: Implement a new regular expression engine. If you want a
new type for them like -meregexp or something that's your decicion.

Most newer generation engines handle some of these things, but the most
complete one I have found is the PCRE Package by Philip Hazel. It is Perl
5.005 compliant and supports all the latest additions, as look-behind
assertions and conditionals. I have personally tested the package and it
worked very well.

I would love to hear your opinions on the matter.

TIA,

I was already planning to use GNU regexp in tf 5.0.  It supports the
features Nuutti described in Perl regexp except for the (?...) extensions.

Aside from "nifty" features, the things I want in a regexp library for tf
are:

* portability
* ability to be compatible with tf's current regexps, so users' code
  doesn't break
* trouble-free licensing (e.g., gnu copyleft)

GNU regexp has those features.  If PCRE has them, I'll consider it as well.

I am currently very busy, and will attend the matter more carefully in the
next few days.

PCRE is portable as far as I know. PCRE is compatible with tf's current
regexps as far as I checked, and PCRE is based directly on perl regular
expression syntax which is based on V8 Regular Expression engine. GNU
regexps are based on POSIX standard, which imho defined different
expectations on solving ambiguity. So PRCE should me more compatible than
GNU. As for licencing, it has no more of a problem than is with the
previous version of regular expressions, they were too under a copyright.

If you are interested in the subject I would suggest reading "Mastering
Regular Expressions" by Jeffrey Friedl.

Assertions and case insensitivity by parts are imho very important parts
of regular expressions. For example it is hard to do this without case
insensitivity "We are here to help, ((?i)if anything)".

But I can make a proper comparison of the two regular expression engines
and correctly answer these questions somewhere in the near future.

In the meanwhile, if you are interested in checking yourself:

PCRE, ftp://ftp.cus.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programs/pcre/
documentation for the regexps isn't complete, as they are compliant with
perl derivates.

I have given this some serious thought, and here's what I came up with:

/require -q tr.tf

;;; Syntax: /addchar world_name char pass
;;;
/def -i addchar = \
  /if ({#} != 3) \
    /echo -e % addchar: incorrect number of arguments.%;\
    /break%;\
  /endif%;\
  /let _new_world=$[strcat({1}, ".", tr(" ", "_", {2}))]%;\
  /test addworld(_new_world, world_info({1}, "type"), world_info({1}, 
"host"), world_info({1}, "port"), {2}, {3}, world_info({1}, "mfile"), 
world_info({1}, "proxy"))

Then you would use:

/addworld -T"Tiny.MUSH" VaporMUSH caisr2.caisr.cwru.edu 4250
/addchar VaporMUSH Jad mypassword

to add charcters, that's all. You characters will be defined as worlds
"VaporMUSH.Jad" for example. You will need to /load your world file though
if you make changes.

Perhaps this could be part of stdlib.tf?

I know I may get seriously roasted for suggesting this, and I may deserve it,
but...

Has anyone ever thought about making an xtinyfugue?  ie, TF with a GUI front
end?  Something that would let people use menus and dialogue boxes to set up
triggers, macros, etc?

We all know how nice TF is.  There are a lot of people moving to Linux from
Win these days, and those of them that MUD for the most part are zMudders.  It
would be nice for them if there was something that would bring TF to their
level.  For a lot of them, learning how all the handwritten defs work is
beyond them.

And even for those of us who prefer command lines, sometimes its nice to have
a GUI.  I have a lot of stuff I want to set up for my TF that I just haven't
had time to do... some kind of GUI tools could have made it so I would have
had the time.

I do NOT at all want to see TF lose any of the command line functionality it
has now or anything... I'm just suggesting a GUI /front end/ to what is there
now, nothing more (well, a graphical automapper would be a nice add on
module...)

Anyway, end of disclaimer... anyone else done any thinking on this?  Ken, do
you utterly hate the idea?

Flame away.

I would think the best away to go about this is someone write a tck/tk program/script to do the GUI part
then poeple could load a tf file to make the new settings take effect. No code change and still would be very portable.

I remeber a while ago someone saying they used a tcl/tk mapper of some sort (was during the tf/zmud debate). Anyone know where I can get this mapper?

Yes, exactly.  It would be a GUI front end based on some widget set
(tk/gtk/qt) that would basically just let users enter values and then generate
the appropriate config files for TF to use.

People who used the GUI could still run TF from a console, since the config
files would work regardless.  This way they could have the GUI available when
they wanted it but not be unable to use TF if they didn't have GUI access at a
given time.

I mostly asked if Ken hated it because TF is his project, not because it would
require any changes to TF itself.

Perhaps saying "gui frontend" is the wrong approach guys...
it gets the backs up on the ppl who really think gui's are unnessary
and waste cpu and memory.

from what i'm hearing, what you really want, is a configuration tool.
a way of addind/removing/editing triggers,worlds.. etc

And you are exactly right.. tcl/tk is the perfect approach for such a
thing. I pesonally have another tcl/tk project going, or i'd volunteer to
write it, but i'd be willing to help anyone who is interested in writing
such a tool.

I agree it definitely has to be in tcl/tk as that is the most portable
native gui toolkit. I have a few more ideas (which were lengthier until
the stupid win95 box crashed).

* Give user choice of terminal, whether color xterm, rxvt, NT console, or
a tcl/tk ansi-capable terminal (such as the on in the SMM client).

* Develop a way to use "themes" to help manage terminal settings. A theme
would define things like background pixmap to use (for rxvt and ETerm)
whether or not to use a scrollbar, background/foreground colors, extra
resources, etc. It would have a config file associating worlds with
themes, editable from the GUI. I think this is a good starting point, it
can help work out the design of the GUI itself, which is important for
useability.

* A help menu, which would just point a browser, system's or configured
choice, to a local directory with the help tarball. Add index and search
and stuff.

* We have to figure out how to do IPC with tf, probably using a socket,
pipe, or file. (it needs to be portable).

* Macro editor should be just something to help newbies and for testing,
people will continue to use an editor to do serious programming. But would
be nice for people to be able to add triggers, aliases, etc, easily
without having to learn alot of syntax.

Just brainstorming, learning a bit of tcl/tk since I never touched the
stuff before, maybe I'll eventually get to trying to implement some of
this...but hopefully someone with a bit more of a clue will, in which case
I would be very happy to help :)

allo all,  

        I've got at least a basic gui front end to tf done. It works 
well for what it does. I chose the GTK tool kit. It's available in
the GNOME cvs for those of you interested in it. The last time I posted
I got almost no response, so I assumed, perhaps wrongly that noone was
interested in it. It is licensed under the GPL, yes, I take patches. If
there is interest developing now, I would offer the program I've written
so far to you all as a base.

        For some basic program info, I'll offer this up: :) 
It'd designed as a complete front end to TF, so much in that every command
available to you under tf, is available under Crescendo (yes that's its name).

background links:

GTK =>  http://www.gtk.org
GNOME =>http://www.gnome.org

anything else you'd all like to know, I'd be more than happy to answer..

Will

	SOCKS doesn't use the proxy_* variables internal to TF.  Those
are used strictly for dealing with a telnet proxy.  SOCKS is something
else entirely.  When compiled with SOCKS, TF makes all the usual 
socket calls to equivalent calls in teh SOCKS library.  The SOCKS
library looks for its own configuration file, either /etc/socks.conf
for SOCKS4 or /etc/libsocks5.conf for SOCKS5, and then does its 
own thing.  
	If TF sees proxy_host has a value, it will attempt to use it
(basically defaulting to using a telnet proxy).  If you really want to
use SOCKS, you have to /unset proxy_host and proxy_port.  This way
TF will attempt a 'normal' connection, but the SOCKS library will take
over onthe socket-call level and handle the proxy-ing for you.

I can't seem to get SOCKS5 proxying to work.
i compiled with SOCKS='5' and the other options under it.
i set proxy_host and proxy_port
but it seems to immidately try to connect to the proxy host, and then is
disconnected.

i suspect its my proxy_command  but i have no idea what to change it to.
any ideas?

Okay, my problem is one that should be simple, but doesn't seem to be.
There is almost certainly something I'm missing.
I have a prompt from my mud that I get info from to put into my status bar.
 However, I don't want to see the actual prompt.  I've tried defining the
hooks that get the prompt info with -ag, I've tried doing 
/def -ag -w'worldname' -mglob -h'PROMPT ' gag_hook
None of it seems to work.  What am I missing?
To see the prompts themselves, if you care, log into dracos.ptn.net 3000
and type 'hud on'.

This is done with a trigger, yes?

Triggers don't automatically fall through unless you tell them to.  So
after the one setting the status bar has triggered, tinyfugue stops
looking for any more and the one which you want to gag, doesn't.  Use
the -F (for 'fallthrough) flag to the higher priority /def to allow the
second one to run.

Does this then fix it?

Christ, I'm an idiot, you said it was in the gnome CVS, sorry.

Now to see if it's possible to compile this thing not using the whole CVS
tree but just the regular gnome packages... libgtktty at least hasn't made
it into Debian yet, maybe there's an rpm somewhere?

Hi,

I've just upgraded my PC from FreeBSD 2.2.5 to FreeBSD 3.0, and
an unfortunate result was that my trusty old tinyfugue (version
3.5 alpha 16) stopped working due to shared library changes.

Not too worried, I installed tf 4.0 beta 2 which was with
the packages for FreeBSD 3.0. The result was not a resounding
success.

After a couple of wasted hours trying to figure out what
I needed to change/add/remove from my .tfrc to get it
to work, I gave up and deleted 4.0 beta 2. After much
rummaging around I eventually located the 3.5a16 source
and recompiling that I'm now happy again.

However, it would be nice to be able to use the latest
version of tinyfugue, so I'm wondering if anyone has any
ideas on how to configure 4.0b2 so that it behaves the
way 3.5a16 does?

The sorts of problems I'm experiencing in 4.0b2 are:

* colour support is erratic. 

Sometimes colour works, sometimes it doesn't. Mostly it
seems it doesn't, especially if the colour codes are at
the start of a line. (ANSI codes). If I set emulation=raw
rather than emulation=ansi_attr then the colour codes 
work but eventually the screen screws up in visual=on 
mode. (In 3.5a16 it works flawlessly with ansi_attr.)
 
I've tried various settings of the TERM environment
variable, ANSI, vt220, vt100, xterm, xterm-color etc
but nothing seems to help (TERM=xterm works for 3.5a16).

The xterm it's running in is an X11R6 xterm, as supplied
with Xfree86 3.3.2 for FreeBSD 3.0.


* automatic login doesn't work

3.5a16 connects and logs into my lpp type worlds fine.
4.0b2 never sends the login character name and 
password.


* worlds go into the background when you connect

In 3.5a16, I connect to a world and it stays in the
foreground. In 4.0b2 it goes into the background and
stays there until I type /fg. I've tried setting
auto_fg=on and bg_output=on in .tfrc but it doesn't
seem to have any effect.


* local echo defaults to off

In 3.5a16, the local echo in the command window stays
on unless the mud sends WILL ECHO (which it does to
disable local echo for password entry). In 4.0b2 the
local echo in the command window seems to switch off
as soon as you connect to a world. It doesn't come
back until the mud sends WONT ECHO after password
entry, or you enable it yourself. This means you
can't see what you are typing as you log in. I can't
find a way to turn off this extra echo.



* commands echo to the world window

In 4.0b2, commands entered in the command window are
echoed in the world window when you press enter, even
if local echo is off. This means when you enter a
password with local echo turned off by the mud, it
becomes visible in the world window when you press enter.


Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can
fix these problems? The vital one is colour support as
colour coding is important on my mud. The other three
are more annoying than anything else. 

On the other hand, should I just stick with 3.5a16 since
it seems to work fine? 

Any thoughts appreciated,

You should get 4.0 GAMMA 2.

These all sound like things you've done that interfere with the
defaults.  Check your configuration.

The FreeBSD ports collection still has 4.0b2 (no-one's found time to upgrade
it, I guess). It's easy to compile gamma2 yourself, although you don't get the
benefits of being able to automatically delete all the installed files later.

4.0b2 works fine for me compiled out of the FreeBSD ports collection on
3.0-current. I don't see any of the problems you mention here (in particular
the color/emulation problems - the others are less likely to be OS-specific);
I'd guess they're either a follow-on effect from something else on your system
(perhaps your .tfrc config files), or a bug in 4.0b2.

I've submitted an updated tinyfugue port (PR ports/8873) for 4.0g2. It may not
be committed straight away because of the ports freeze for the forthcoming
FreeBSD 2.2.8 release, but in the meantime you can download it from the GNATS
database at www.freebsd.org.

I'm now using tf 4.0g2 compiled myself, and it exhibited the
same lack of colour as 4.0b2 until I renamed my .tfrc file
so that it did not find it. Then colour works ok (should
have tried that before really).

Since my .tfrc is tiny, the problem was quickly traced to
the '/nohilite' command in my .tfrc. It was long, long ago
I made the .tfrc file and I can't remember now why I put
/nohilite in there, so I've just removed it.

However, I'm confused as to why /nohilite blocks incoming 
colours? The help suggests it should only affect /hilite
matches, and in 3.5a16 it doesn't affect incoming colours.

The .tfrc is tiny as I've said, I can't find anything in
it that affects the other problems - see my answer to Ken.

I'm now using gamma 2. 

The colour problem turned out to be caused by '/nohilite' -
if I take that out of my .tfrc then colour works fine. I'm
still confused as to why it blocks incoming colours though,
I thought it only affected /hilite triggers?

Well that was what I suspected as well, but I can't see anything
in my .tfrc that would affect them. Even if I remove my .tfrc
file altogether, automatic login still doesn't work and when you
connect the world goes into the background and local echo turns
off. Also I've noticed that the initial login prompt the mud
sends is never displayed.

I'd appreciate some hints as to what sort of thing to look for
to set.

Here's my .tfrc (less passwords):

/addworld -T"lpp" Scattermud scatter xxxxxxxx localhost 5000
/addworld -T"lpp" Termite scatter xxxxxxxx sorrows.imaginary.com 5050
/addworld -T"lpp" Scatter scatter xxxxxxxx eclipse.cs.pdx.edu 7680
/more on
/def -iB"up"    = /dokey recallb
/def -iB"down"  = /dokey recallf
/set proxy_host=10.0.0.2
/undef proxy_command
/def -i proxy_command = ${world_host} ${world_port}
/visual on

The only things I have changed from the 3.5a16 version is
that I've removed /nohilite, and the up/down key bindings used 
to be:

/unbind ^[[A
/unbind ^[[B
/bind ^[[A = /dokey recallb
/bind ^[[B = /dokey recallf

but these bindings don't work in 4.0g2.

Now, when I connect to my mud I see this:

%tf termite

[login screen snipped]

Dawn Whispers is deserted.
_________Termite_____________________________


Now there is a login prompt that has been sent, but I can't
see it. The login prompt is "Please enter your name:" followed
by telnet IAC GA. The local echo has turned off at this
point, even though the mud has not sent any ECHO negotiation. 
Now if I type my name blind, 'scatter', the prompt appears,
immediately followed by the password prompt:


_________Termite_____________________________
Please enter your name: Enter your password:

Once I enter my password, the mud sends telnet WONT ECHO which
re=enables local echo, and everything is fine from then on.

The commands being echoed into the world window when you
press enter does not happen with 4.0g2, so I assume
that the default was different in 4.0b2.

Do you have any suggestions as to what I might need to
configure / change to make the world stay in the foreground,
to have local echo stay on unless the mud offers WILL ECHO
and to make automatic login work?

Thanks for any help,

You probably don't want to connect to localhost through the proxy server,
so you should define Scattermud with -p.

Your proxy_command explains the lack of foreground and login.  The default
proxy_command uses /trigger -hCONNECT and /trigger -hLOGIN to invoke those
functions, but yours doesn't.

The localecho is also explained by the proxy, although the default
proxy_command would not handle it either.  The proxy server (not the
mud) requests that tf turn localecho off, and tf complies, before the
proxy server even makes the connection to the mud.

This proxy_command should fix all your problems.  It's just the default
proxy_command, modified for your proxy server's syntax, plus a localecho
correction:

  /def -i proxy_command = \
      ${world_host} ${world_port}%; \
      /localecho on%; \
      /trigger -hCONNECT ${world_name}%; \
      /if (login & ${world_character} !~ "" & ${world_login}) \
          /trigger -hLOGIN ${world_name}%; \
      /endif

TF 4.0 puts the keypad in application mode; on a vt100, this makes the
up arrow key transmit ^[OA instead of ^[[A.  (You can see this if you
type ^V up).  TF does this for agreement with termcap, so that -B"up"
works.

Using the ^[OA code is the "right" thing to do, but some odd emulators
may still transmit ^[[A.  So to cover both cases, you may want to define
identical bindings for ^[[A and ^[OA (like %TFLIBDIR/kbbind.tf does).

Ah, I guess this is the crucial difference from version 3.5 then,
which did the triggers anyway.

Yep, that has solved the problems. Many thanks!

Greetings,

When receiving lines that are gagged with -ag, my prompt disappears
but it is not restored untill I receive another prompt. And a new
prompt is only sent by the mud after I enter a new command (which
is quite acceptable from the mud). But I don't understand why tf
removes my prompt in the first place...

Also when I'm typing mud commands that are longer than my screenwith,
the beginning line(s) of the command are redrawn when gagged lines are
received. As a result these line(s) are shown twice right above
eachother.

This is especially annoying when you are gagging quite a lot of stuff.
I DO appreciate that tf removes the prompt when it does show some new
output from the mud though - and that it redraws the entire line when
I receive normal text :-)

Hopefully this can be fixed - either by a tf macro or by a source patch.

Thanks,
Johan van Selst

On a related note: when I gag lines containing special codes (like a ^G,
beep) then the first time the special codes (but not the rest of the
line) comes through: so I get beeped :) However all following lines are
gagged completely. Then I receive some output that I don't gag, and the
special code in the next gagged line is allowed through again...

I've only experienced this strange behaviour in one world, so it might
be a bug in that mud. However, I'm afraid it's something that TF
does wrong... Did anyone else get this kind of problems?
btw. I'm using 4.0 gamma 2.

Ciao,
Johan

I've seen muds that put the ^G before the newline, which means it's at
the end of the previous line, instead of the beginning of the line on
which it belongs.  This would explain your observed behavior.  You can
see if your mud does this by setting emulation=debug.

Hi!
I have a rather simple problem, but i'm stuck :(

I must do something like:

for(i=0;i<15;i++)
   for(j=0;j<15;j++)
      for(k=0;k<15;k++) {
         tell squire red secret is i;
         tell squire yellow secret is j;
         tell squire blue secret is k;
         (1 second delay here)       
      }
... you got my point.

  How can i do this in tf?
All replies appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

Are you *sure* you want to do this?

As written, this program will send 10125 lines of text to the remote site.
It will take just short of 1 hour to complete if there are no delays.

My guess is that you are trying to break a combination by trying every
possibility. When I coded a combination lock in a game, I used to refuse
all tries (until a reset) from that player after a number of wrong
attempts. This was just to defeat this sort of thing and make people solve
the puzzle to get the combination.

Yes, as a matter of fact, this is what i want to do... The important thing
here is that delay. I could do that manually, it would be the same number
of lines sent to the mud...
There is no puzzle to solve instead of breaking that lock, and the quest
creator allows for wrong iterations (i.e. doesn't block further tries
after a number of wrong combinations).
Just for the love of the art, how do i translate that in tf?

There is probably a very 'smart' way to do what you want. Mine is not
clever, but it does what you want and for a 1 off job, it is adequate.

/def crack = \
  /set i 0 %; \
  /set j 0 %; \
  /set k 0 %; \
  /crack1

/def crack1 = \
  /while (i < 15) \
    /crack2 %; \
    /test ++i %; \
  /done

/def crack2 = \
  /while (j < 15) \
    /crack3 %; \
    /test ++j %; \
  /done %; \
  /set j 0

/def crack3 = \
  /while (k < 15) \
    tell squire red secret is %{i} %; \
    tell squire yellow secret is %{j} %; \
    tell squire blue secret is %{k} %; \
    /test ++k %; \
  /done %; \
  /set k 0

I will leave you to put in delays and triggers to stop the code one the
combination has been found.

Keeping in mind Keith C. Howell's point that this will
take 56 minutes to run, it is possible:

/set i=0
/set j=0
/set k=0
/def do_next = \
	/echo /send tell squire red secret is %i %;\
	/echo /send tell squire yellow secret is %j %;\
	/echo /send tell squire blue secret is %k %;\
	/test ++k %;\
	/if (k == 16) \
	  /set k=0 %;\
	  /test ++j %;\
	  /if (j == 16) \
		/set j=0 %;\
		/test ++i %;\
	  /endif %;\
        /endif %;\
        /if (i < 16) \
	  /repeat -0:0:1 1 /do_next %;\
	/endif

/do_next

A cleaner solution might exist, if you're in it for the art, but
this'll get you going.

I think that sometimes triggers aren't caught. That's when a
screen is scrollin (via spam or something). I'm sure of that
because I vane  a trigger that react on mob in room and ...
sometimes it reacts sometimes not.
The same is with hilites - some textes that should be hilited
aren't. I think it's something connected with a speed of the game
but I'm not sure of that at all.
Does anybody has similar problems. If so - help me please.

Without further research, it's possible the line is being split in transi,
and tf processes one half, then the other, so doesn't catch the whole
trigger.  This would only occur in a world that had prompts, I believe.

This is just a guess, I'm sure Ken or someone else would have a better
explanation, or some actual advice.

Well, there's another explanation, too:
When there's a huge amount of text produced by the mud, the mud output
buffer for the connection will overflow and some lines will get lost
that way.
At last thats what i experience whith LP and DGD (didn't check others)
based muds with mass-combat rounds of 10+ people with many spamming
things and all verbose mode on.
Solution? None from the client.
It's a problem from the driver. Perhaps a faster line interface or a
larger buffer would help .. or just reduce the amout of text things
tend to generate .. :)
To check if thats the problem, log the whole event and check if the
trigger text comes through. If not, it's the above problem. If it
comes, wenn check your macros/troggers. Never had any problems in that
direction.

Check to see if you have multiple triggers that catch on the same text and
have the same priority. If so, a random one of those will be executed.
Find them and change the priority and/or add/change fall-through status to
them.

I'm assuming these are unterminated prompts detected with the lp=on
heuristics, not with IAC GA, IAC EOR, or PROMPT hooks.  With lp=on,
when tf receives a partial line, it interprets it as a prompt.  Then,
after some delay, if tf receives more text, it decides the prompt and
the new text are both parts of the same long line that was interrupted
by net lag.  So tf deletes the prompt and prepends it to the new text
to make one line.  If that resulting line is gagged, it doesn't matter;
the gag happens after the joining.

OTOH, if the prompt is definitely a prompt (i.e., it was terminated with
IAC GA or IAC EOR, or was matched by a PROMPT hook), tf will not change its
mind like that.  So, you should be able to prevent your problem (and several
others) by making PROMPT hooks for your mud's prompts.

Perhaps in the future tf will put a time limit on the concatenation;
e.g., if the delay between a partial line and some more text is more
than 3s, then tf will consider the prompt "definite" and will not join
it to the following text.

This is the same problem.  When the prompt is deleted, the entire input
buffer shifts to the left, and must be redrawn.

I have a whole bunch of highlights made as follows:

/def -F -PhCyellow -mregexp -i -t'.* asks you: ' asks_me_hi

Since I went to 4.0 b3 I keep getting spammed with a whole bunch of
lines telling me that .* as beginning in a regexp isn't a good idea, so
can someone tell me how I should make a highlight with the same
functionality, ie highlighting anything anyone "asks you:"?

It can be both one word or a description of an NPC or whatever. 

Regards,
	Kimmo.

Yep, you're completely right. When special codes appear in a line, the
mud decides to send a (non-terminated) color reset code on a new line.
(i.e. a line with just ^[[0m and no closing CRLF).
When they had a beep in the line, it would become "^G^[[0m"...
Thanks a lot for your help! Now lemme try and get people to change the
extremely annoying behaviour of that mud ;-)

Don't change the behaviour of TF; it's great just the way it is...

/at itself uses /repeat with only one execution, so why complicate it?

Just use -t' asks you: '  Regexps match on parts of the line anyway, so you
just don't need the .*

Or use -mglob -t'* asks you: *', since the docs say it's best to use globs
when you can since they are more efficient than regexps...

Although both these solutions will match the same patterns, they won't
perform the highlighting in the same way - #1 will only highlight "asks you"
and not the leading name, and the glob will highlight the entire line.

Assuming player names are only one word (cannot contain spaces), I suggest:

/def -F -PhCyellow -mregexp -i -t'^[^ ]+ asks you: ' asks_me_hi

I may be missing something, but is there an easy way to pause between 
commands in a script?

For example I want to do:

do something
<pause execution here for 5 seconds>
do something else
do some more stuff
<pause execution here for 10 seconds>
do yet more stuff
etc...


I think I can get this to work with /REPEAT, but the repeat statements 
get so long when I have to add the rest of the commands. I was just 
wondering, is there an easier way?

If not, Hawkeye, maybe this is something you could add in a future 
version?

Thanks!

Since TF processes triggers, macros, etc synchronously, if you had a method
for pausing mid-execution, the entire TF would freeze (e.g. you wouldn't
see any output on screen, wouldn't be able to type anything, etc).  This is
the same effect as executing something with /quote -S.

Therefore, you need to process your commands asynchronously - which means
scheduling events to happen later.  This is exactly what /repeat does...
so, there is no 'nice' way of doing it, other than putting the commands you
want to run after the pause into a macro to keep the length down:

/def do_stuff2=\
  /do_more_stuff... %%;\
  /do_stuff_3 %;\
/def do_stuff_3=... %;\

/do_stuff %;\
/repeat -10 1 /do_stuff

Yeah, that would work - but unfortunately, what comes before "asks" can
be both a name and a description with spaces. Thanks, though, will save
that one for future use!

Yup, I thought of that - but I like having the npc/persons name/desc
highlighted too, thus the .*, inefficient as it is.

Aha... thanks, I guess I'll just convert the highlights to globs then.
Come to think of it, there is no real reason to have them as regexes,
they're not that complicated.

Not exactly what you want, but if it's a long sequence, perhaps a look at
my so-called fifo would help. Instead on triggering on a special line from
the mu*, you could rewrite it to do an appropriate /repeat statement
after each part of commands.

It's some work and I'm rather busy now, but if you don't find any better
ideas and need help, I'll do my best ...

The fifo can be found at

Well, when I suggested that I wasn't seeing the -P option you were using.
Partial hilites /have/ to be regexps, so if you want to keep them partials you
do have a real reason to have them as regexps.

Still you perhaps can get rid of the .* just by hilighting PL too (did not
test):
/def -F -PhCyellow -PLCyellow -mregexp -i -t' asks you: ' asks_me_hi

Yeah... as I found out when I tried converting them. I really don't have
the energy to care deeply about learning to make tf macros, so I guess 
my next question is - how do I make TF stop spamming me with info about
how .* is inefficient, since I apparently need to have regexps that start
with .* to do what I want to do? =)

Mvh,

Since there should always be at least 1 character matched by the ".*",
you can change the ".*" to ".+".  (It's still just as inefficient, but
it won't generate a warning.  TF warns about leading ".*" because many
users write it without realizing that it isn't needed and slows down
their TF.  Cases of partial hiliting like this are the only cases in
which it really is needed.)

 Greetings,

 I am having trouble connecting through to a MUD using tinyfugue. I can telnet 
and reach the host after some delay, but connections within tinyfugue to that 
particular host always yield "% Connection to doti failed: nonblocking 
connect: Connection timed out"... connections to this exact same type of game 
on a separate machine work out fine, though there is not anywhere as much of a 
delay when using straight telnet to that host.

 So... I need to have tinyfugue wait the extra few seconds it takes to do the 
initial connection (gotta love AIX ;) Anyone know some way to do this, 
preferably on a per world basis when loading my tiny.worlds file?

 Thanks,

 -Chris

I was considering writing a C program to generate nfa's
(non-determined finite automata) tinyfugue code. TF makes it pretty
trivial. All we need is state-keeping and state-checking in the
triggers. Ideally, this would be a graphical application, but I'm not
going into _that_... :-)

Would anyone want something like this?

Answer number 1, read inside the parenthesis. :-)

Answer number 2, a non-determined finite automata is... a strange thing. :-)
Determined finite automatas are one of the most useful and used things in
programming and computer science, whether people realize [they are using it]
or not.

Non-determined finite automata are used mainly (to the extent of my knowledge,
which is not that extensive :) in protocol study, as far as computer science
goes (automata come from mathematics, so all kinds of studies exist outside
CS).

Most tinyfugue programs are, in fact, automata (or can be reduced to one). Not
surprisingly, since a computer itself is an automatum.

So, now, for the explanation... :-) I'll mix informal description with
explanation here. I think it'll be easier to understand this way.

An automatum is a collection (set) of states (let's call it S :) with a
function indicating transitions between them (f(S,W)->S, meaning that giving
the current state c, and an input w, the function returns a new state n; n can
be the same as c). This explanation can be easily expanded or formalized into
all sorts of automata. Let's give a simple example.

Think of a door. It has two states: open and closed. Giving two inputs, "open"
and "close", it has the following transitions:

State: closed. Input: open. New state: open.
State: open. Input: close. New state: closed.

We can also add (or, formally speaking, must add) the following transitions:

State: closed. Input: close. New state: closed.
State: open. Input: open. New state: open.

Or, we could add another state, called "error", and rewrite the transitions
above as:

State: closed. Input: close. New state: error.
State: open. Input: open. New state: error.

We would have to add the transitions for the state "error" then. Or not. That
depends on how formal we want this. It doesn't really matter, unless you are
applying automata theory to study the system.

So, what do I want to do? Well, it should be obvious that tf's triggers will
act as transitions. It might not be as obvious that /repeat will be used to
make "timeouts" as transitions too. The idea is having a list of possible
transitions, and then adding states and assigning transitions between them.
For every non-defined f(s,w), the system will assume f(s,w)=s, and will either
/undef the trigger or code it so that the state won't change.

ALSO, for each transition between two states defined, assign a macro to be
run. This let's the automata "do" things.

Examples of use:

1) I want an idler. I have only one state, called "idle", and one transition,
triggered by the passage of 30 seconds. So, f(idle,30s)=idle (the software
should spare you of writing things like that, of course; drag&drop on a GUI
would be wonderful, but I don't have the time or the tools -- any TCL/TK
hacker around? :). Each time this transition happens, I call the macro
"idler", defined as:

/def idler = /send :looks around.

2) Gimme a break, that idler s*cked! Ok, let's define two states: idle and
nonidle. We have two transitions: 30s timeout and sendhook. So, I'd do
something like this:

New [S]tate
State name: idle
New [S]tate
State name: nonidle
New [T]ransition
Transition name: timeout
Transition type:
[T]imeout trigger
Timeout time (in seconds): 30
New [T]ransition
Transition name: sendhook
Transition type:
[H]ook trigger
Hook type:
[S]end hook
[C]reate transition table
State: idle      Transition: 30(s) timeout trigger
Enter destination state:
(1) idle
Transition macro: <enter>
State: idle      Transition: send hook
Enter destination state:
(1) nonidle
Transition macro: <enter>
State: nonidle   Transition: 30(s) timeout trigger
Enter destination state:
(1) idle
Transition macro: idler
State: nonidle   Transition: send hook
Enter destination state:
(1) nonidle
Transition macro: <enter>

Yup?

3) Ok, that was better. Now, explain to me why do you want a "non-determined"
automata? What's that anyway?

Well, a non-determined automata is one in which there is possibly more than
one valid transition. What I plan to do, specifically, is make use of tf's
"chance" of a trigger happening. For hooks and /repeat it will be a little bit
more complicated, but absolutely managable (and since the C program will write
the tf code, you don't need to worry about it). That's not exactly what a nfa
is, but there is an nfa for it. Also, there will be random selection between
valid triggers, which is what nfa provides for.

So, what could I use it for? Well, let's get back to the example above. We
have one timeout trigger. Let's define instead 10 different 30 seconds timeout
triggers. Each of them executes a different macro (idler1, idler2, etc). So,
when the timeout happens, it will just select at random one of the macros to
run. Like:

/def idler1 = :looks around.
/def idler2 = :plays with his buttons.
/def idler3 = :tries to catch a fly.
etc

Next, instead of making the timeout a 100% chance transition, let's give it
10% chance. So, after each 30 seconds, the system checks which transitions
"happened" (average 1, of course, but more likely either 0 or more than one),
then randomly selects between the remaining ones, if any.

We could even assign a 90% or 95% chance to the sendhook transition from idle
to nonidle, so that sometimes the idle messages would appear even during
normal action.

So?

I guess that's the big question :-) For all of the formalism, what would this
/really/ be useful for? What could you do this way that would be impossible

I am from Yugoslavia and cant ftp outside my country and was wondering if
someone could send me some version of tinyfugue that would work best on
solaris. I got one version compiled it but i get the impression that
status bar of TF hides the text mud sends under it. How can i set the
number of lines i tried /set LINES 19 but i doesnt seem to work!

It's useful for 'bots.

It can also be used to create complex monsters in a game. I know of at least
one MUD that has it. 


In physics, it has been used to smulate various things, including magnets
optical filters. In CS, I think the N stands for non-deterministic, rather
than non-determind, but I could be wrong.

This got me thinking: is there anyway we could apply regexp patterns
to parameters? It might be quite handy at times.

As for the question, I don't know. I tried a little bit with "kill",
"sleep", "at" and scripts, but no success. Good luck... :-)

Well... since I'm not much a fan of 'bots, I tried very hard to
avoid mentioning this. :-)

But, mind you, this thing generates tf code. It's for player use.

Just to set the record straight, that's correct. As I wasn't paying
much attention to what I was writing, the more familiar "determined"
got in instead of "deterministic". :-)

Well, that's a good question I should have got into. There is
absolutely nothing this thing does that you can't do in TF, because
the only thing it really does is *generate TF code*.

In fact, when I first thought about it, I considered it more as a
tool to generate skeleton code for "applications" in tf.

And that's the whole point, really. Making it easier/faster/"safer"
to create certain kinds of programs.

I once played on a battletech muse for which I had tons of tf source
code. A lot of that code were manually-implemented automatum. A
little bit boring, specially for some kind of changes, but really
simple.

But one tool I never got to implement, to which my mind always gets
back (even though that muse is out of order for a long time now, and
it's not even a muse anymore), is a system to help radioing of
messages.

Some battles where quite big, and you had a lot of "radio" channels,
up and down hierarchy. Commanding officers were often spending much
more time sorting out the radio traffic than considering the
battlefield. The natural solution would be having radio operators to
exchange, prioritize, select and forward messages, but without good
tools, that task was hopeless.

On the other hand, creating such a tool is also a nightmare. And
this is where that program I suggested comes in. With it, I can
easily work on the protocol. Changing it gets much faster and
simpler, and I avoid a lot of coding bugs that would get into the
way of detecting protocol bugs.

Well, I guess if you would find it useful, that's reason enough to do the
work. For other people, coding a proof-of-concept with a real-world example,
showing how it's easier to do it using your system compared to vanilla TF,
would probably be best. This may well be quite useful (probably would be, to
some people), but I'm still having difficulty imagining exactly how and why. A
PoC would likely fix that..

Try something like: 

/def s = /send /s %*

I've run into the same problem on various talkers, when in an editing
mode for messages, a / is required to do regular, non-editor commands.
To get around this, just use two slashes, ie "//s" to perform your
action.

I have been very busy and haven't had the time to look into the matter, but
here I will outline some points on why we should use Perl-like regular
expressions rather than POSIX regular expressions. As for compatibility,
portability and copyright matters, everything seems to be fine, but I still
haven't had the time to look into the matter.

1. Non-greedy matches

The classical example of this is the C comment matching, where we try to
use the regular expression
  /\*.*\*/
to match this line
  /* first command */  not comment  /* second comment */
and we ofcourse see that this doesn't work because the .* gobbles up all it
can all the way to the final comment. This could be solved by other mean
probably, but the regexp would look horrible - with perl regexp that have
been in use for years, we simply write
  /\*.*?\*/
to make the .* ungreedy by changing it to .*?. This is a very important
feature in a regular expression matcher and it was the first problem I ever
had with tinyfugue regular expressions.

2. Subgroups

I have very often big regular expressions with multiple parenthesis. I have
to use often more than 20 of them to make my expression exact. This makes
me hard to extract any values I need from the expression because tinyfugue
spits out fields only for the first 9. I often have to first match the
whole expression and then specifically regmatch a less definite match to
get the fields that I need. Perl facilitates this by having "(?:foo)" to be
exactly like "(foo)" but it doesn't spit out a submatch from it. This can
also processing time for we do not need to assign variables for parenthesis
that are used only syntactically.

3. Efficiency

The perl regular expression engine has been specifically engineered for
speed and efficiency. Example, if an expression starts with .*, it is
implicitely anchored to the beginning, which lessens the speed drain on the
expression. Also, one thing which IMHO is very vital for tinyfugue, perl
regular expressions allow us to "study" the string being matched
beforehand, if multiple matches are going to be used on it. This doesn't
matter much to those glob users, but us regexp junkies might have hundreds
of regexp matches for a line - this way, the processing time needed can be
reduced noticeably. Ofcourse we would have to restudy the string everytime
it's changed thru a substitute or something and the feature should be
toggleable. And there are many ways to finetune the regular expressions
faster, like once-only subpatterns (example later).

4. Comments and extended syntax

We can have comments ("(#this is an important place)") in the regular
expressions and we can use the extended syntax, where no whitespace is
interpreted unless it is preceded with the quoting char ("\"). This makes
large regular expressions much readable.

5. Assertions

The POSIX package knows 4 pre-defined assertions. Or 6 if you count ^ and $
in it also. These are word-boundary, non-word boundary (within word),
beginning of word, end of word. Perl regular expressions have unlimited
ways of creating assertions. Most of the time you are using assertions even
though you don't notice it. Assertions are zero-width operators that look
ahead or look behind in the inputstream. Simple ones are ofcourse done
easily without assertions, example:
  foo(?=bar)                  Foo followed by bar, %P0 contains foo
  (foo)bar                    Same thing, %P1 contains foo
The true power starts to manifest itself when we start doing negative
assertions:
  foo(?!bar)                  Foo that is not followed by bar
  (foo)[^b][^a][^r]           but what if the string ends before that?
  (foo)([^b][^a][^r]|.{0,2}$) ...and it even spits out extra fields etc.
But this is all doable, and gets simpler if we move it to tf code. Then we
go into lookbehind:
  (?<=foo)bar                 a bar that has foo following it, %P0 has it
  foo(bar)                    same things, %P1 has it
And ofcourse negative lookbehind is fausible, and doing it without
assertions would be even harder. Now let's take a real world example - we
have a word-boundary operator - now we want a digit-boundary operator. We
make the word boundary operator first with assertions. So it's a non-word
character followed by a word character or word character followed by a
non-word character.
  \W\w|\w\W
Now we notice that we have to handle the beginning of the string and the
ending specially.
  (\W|^)\w|\w(\W|$)
Fine. Now we translate these to assertions so we don't change the input
position.
  ((?<=\W)|^)(?=\w)|(?<=\w)((?=\W)|$)
OK this matches already exactly the same things as \b does, but spits out
extra fields, so
  (?:(?<=\W)|^)(?=\w)|(?<=\w)(?:(?=\W)|$)
OK now we have a functionally exact alternative to \b. But, as a closer
examination reveal, this is still not absolutely the same. This part is a
hard one to explain so I'll take an example. We match the line
  ---foo
against
  \bfob  or  (?:(?<=\W)|^)(?=\w)|(?<=\w)(?:(?=\W)|$)fob
So. We start looking for a match from the beginning of the string, and we
find places that have a non-word character behind them, but not a word
character in front of them, until we come between "-f". There we find a
match and continue trying onwards in the string, where we will find the "f"
and the "o". But as we come to the "b", we have a non-match situation. The
match "\bfob" would end there, but _our_ expression starts backtracking to
see if the other alternative of our main alternation would match (the \W\w
| \w\W alteration - our first case matched so the second case isn't checked
until we find a non-match situation). This is ofcourse very minimal speed
loss but still a notable difference. We solve this by making the expression
once-only subexpression like this:
  (?>(?:(?<=\W)|^)(?=\w)|(?<=\w)(?:(?=\W)|$))
Now we have finally achieved exactly comparable functionality with \b. Our
original goal was to make a digit boundary expression so we make it simply
by changing the character classes:
  (?>(?:(?<=\D)|^)(?=\d)|(?<=\d)(?:(?=\D)|$))

Now I could go on at this for hours, showing you how we can make a line
that is matched case sensitively all the way but for two words in the
middle of the expression and others, but I hope I got the point thru. POSIX
regular expressions aren't in no way sufficient for heavy-duty usage as
tinyfugue requires. Studying, expression inheritent case-insensitivity and
other switches are like made for tinyfugue.

And for the url's on where to find more info:
http://sunland.gsfc.nasa.gov/info/regex/ - for POSIX regexp documentation
ftp://ftp.cus.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programs/pcre/ - for PCRE package
  (the PCRE package is almost fully compatible with perl 5.005 regular
   expressions and is excellent otherwise also)

Now, I'd like to hear opinions on this from others also.

TIA,

Hiya ... 

i have a problem with autologin ... 

i was upgrading my tf from alfa 7 to gamma 2 ( some upgrade, isn't it ?
:-)))))) ) and now the autologin it just doesn't works know ( btw: even in
my old version ... sometimes it just did not work too ... i guess it was
just a question of timing ... ) ... anyway can anybody teach me how the
autologin works in version gamma 2 ? well ... i must mention ( but i guess
you know allready ) that i was use tf for talkers ... and i have defined
the worlds like :
/addworld -T"telnet" world char pass site port ...
so ? what can i do ?

10x
c u l8r, alligator !

It means I shouldn't answer my mail when I'm sleepy. Or, in other
words, I meant like in:

/def at = if $(regmatch("now+[0-9]+m",%*)) ...

Or something like that.

A couple suggestions, Bojan:

- please consider using a smaller '.sig' file ... having a signature
  larger than your whole post is bad "netiquette"

- for multiple commands, use:
  /def -t'You are hungry' eat_pie = get pie back%;eat pie

- as above, name your macros so that you can /edit and /undef them
  later.

- triggers react over and over, any time they see the trigger text, unless
  you define them with -n1 (or -1). You might see a trigger randomly go
  off with a different one if they are both non-fall-thru and of the same
  priority.

No, the default is for triggers to remain permanently.

          The macro is a multi-shot, that is, it will be deleted after it i=

Use %; as the separator, and always name your macros.

Just use two /
In stead of:
/whatever
you type:
//whatever

Works fine for me at least.

On "telnet" worlds, tf 40b1 and later wait for "login:" and "password:"
prompts before sending anything, to avoid timing problems.  Use type
"lp" if your server does not sent such prompts.

% Executing command: ls
sh: option `-c' requires an argument

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0 in ?? ()
(gdb) bt

I haven't had any problems compiling tf on debian, except to make sure
there's an -lncurses option (uses libtermcap by default which is just a
libc5 lib for older stuff, don't ask me why, debian-policy stuff :P )

In any case, there's no longer any reason to compile it yourself, tf is
generally kept reasonably up to date in the unstable branch, eg, 4.0g2 is
at:

ftp://ftp.fuller.edu/debian/dists/potato/main/binary-i386/games/tf_4.0g2-1.deb

Thanks guys for the help, i compiled the TF source code myself because i
didn't know that there is debian package with the latest version, and it is my
bad habit to compile everything on my machine so in case of crash i can fix
smaller things myself without bugging the owner/creator for some solution
which could be just because specific setup of my machine, this particular bug
to me stuck because there was no stack or anything left after the sigsegv, and
the message shown that there was no arguments passed to the shell .. ;)

Thanks coders/creators of TF for such good mud client, ever since i started
using TF you would have to do lobotomy on me to make me use anything else ;)

Hi, I'm wondering how common this MAILPATH syntax is.  I suspect that
it may be specific to the Uni I went to and ex-students who have the
'mailcheck' command from there.  If it is common, this tf-code may help.

Since tf 4.0a9 a MAILPATH env variable has been supported, for multiple
mailboxes.  This uses a colon-separated list.  The alternate syntax we
have uses this, but each element may be a filename, followed by a
question-mark, followed by explanatory text, eg:
 /var/mail/someone:/home/someone/Mail/tinyfugue?Funky new mail in $_!
which becomes more useful with a half-dozen boxes.

If someone knows just how common this is, I'd be interested to hear,
thanks.

The current code is towards the end of stdlib.tf.  This snippet can be
user-included later.

/eval /if (MAILPATH !~ "") \
    /let _hd=%; \
    /let _tl=%{MAILPATH}%; \
    /while (regmatch("^([^?:]+)(\\?[^:]+)?:?", {_tl}))%; \
	/let _hd=%{_hd} %{P1}%; \
	/let _tl=%{PR}%; \
    /done%; \
    /set TFMAILPATH=%{_hd}%; \
/endif

Hope this helps someone.

I have two chars on the same mud but it doesn't allow autoassist
so how would I define a trigger to have char 1 say 'char2 assist' and have
char 2 assist??

You can just send commands to a world in the context of any other world,
eg.:

/send -w"world2" assist

no need for triggers.

Hi guys,

is there some script/lib what can scrolls thru world buffer up/down just by
pressing couple keys, eg. pgup/pgdn ? i tried to make me one but it is kinda
screwy, i still get easily lost in TF scripts :) here is my last attempt if
someone can fix that or point me to working one pls:

/def -b'^[[5~'  = /scroll_up
/def -b'^[[6~'  = /scroll_dn

/set scrla=0
/set scrlb=20

/def -i scroll_up = \
    /test scrla := scrlb%;\
    /test scrlb := scrlb + 20%;\
    /if (scrlb >= 1000) \
        /set scrlb=1000%;\
        /set scrla=980%;\
    /endif%;\
    /recall $[scrla]-$[scrlb]

/def -i scroll_dn = \
    /test scrlb := scrla%;\
    /test scrla := scrla - 20%;\
    /recall $[scrla]-$[scrlb]%;\
    /if (scrla <= 0) \
        /set scrla=0%;\
        /set scrlb=20%;\
    /endif

The only terminal where you can't really get scrollback is the win95
console. On nt or os/2 you can increase the buffer in properties, in unix just
press shift+pgup, also most telnet clients let you bind pgup to
scrollback. But this is sort of off topic.

What I and others find most useful, is to use /recall macros to recall the
most useful bits, eg:

/def tells = /recall -mglob $[{1} ? strcat("/",{1}) : {histsize}] *tell*

typing /tells will then list all the tells stored in the history buffer, 
or typing /tells 10 will recall the last 10 tells.

well i'm in linux, and shift-pgup don't work with TF because the 20-line
window what tf uses to display stuff ..

yeah that's a great idea :) thanks ;)

---

umm, i'm not sure if i wasn't misunderstood, i have kinda working [or more not
working :)] scrollback script, i posted it in last msg, it uses 
/recall <from_line> <to_line> to display segment of the world buffer but i did
something wrong there and it don't recalls right, also i can't find any
function what would return number of lines in the buffer so if i go over
length of the buffer it just increases the from_line and to_line until it hits
1000, if someone can fix it please or would share with me their own script ..
;)
						thanks, Dingo.

THis probably isnt helpful, but I use TF in visual mode using xterm.

More likely its your window manager settings that have remapped the key
bindings to something suboptimal.

If I understand you correctly, scrollback doesn't work in visual mode.
This is somehow related to application mode and some terminals. Make sure
your TERM variable is set correctly. Maybe try rxvt instead of xterm.

Writing a set of scrollback binding is non trivial, and probably
unnecessary. What happens when new text comes in, for example? You could
use /bg perhaps, and the -q flag to /recall, but still.

Perhaps tf5 will have scrolling/pause functions, like in ircII or epic,
which would help with such things.

Actually, I have the same problem.  Shift+PgUp/PgDn don't work for me,
unless I switch my TERM setting to "xterm", which is incorrect for the
newer xterm's that come with the latest XFree package.  My TERM variable
is set to "xterm-xf86-v33".  This leads me to believe it's something in
TinyFugue itself that isn't working right.  I run TF linked with ncurses
4.2.

/recall works, but it is far more inconvenient than just hitting shift
pageup/pagedown.  (It was simply pageup/pagedown until I changed it in my
.Xdefaults file. (I wonder whose idea was it to do it that way.
Applications need those keys.))

I dont think it can be TF... since it has no concept of xterm's
scollbackbuffer. Admittedly, it /could/ be putting the 'vt100' terminal
into a mode that disables those keys, but I doubt it. More likely the
xterm and/or X is configured wrong. But... that's about the limit of my
knowledge.

hiya 

i have a problem with the wrapping in tf
i want to make a mini-irc client in tf-script ... well ... it's not a
problem ... but ... i saw that if i use let's say /set wrapsize=80 all
works almoust ok ... but if i make a trigger and a line has more then 80
chars ... well ... the trigger will apply at only first chars ... so ...
how do i proceed ? 

another problem is that i want all lines coming from server to be
triggered ( or gaged .... ) ... but the promblem is : ALL lines ... what
can i do ... make a hook, problably ... but what params .. ?

You might want to look at http://www.tertius.net.au/~gossamer/code/tf-irc/
for ideas.

If you develop anything that's not in that script, I'd be happy
to back -add things for you.

well when text comes in right now it gets displayed, i kinda like this because
everything what i have to do to get back exactly where i was in scrollback is

that would be great, i'm slowly giving up on scrollback script and i think
that i gonna make me some piece of code what will suspend other output and
scroll thru the history, invoked either by some command from input line or
just keybinding.

To perform cursor movment, an application (tf) must, according to the
termcap api, use the termcap "ti" and "te" codes; on some terminals,
cursor movement just won't work without them.  Unfortunately for tf
users, many termcap databases have an entry for xterm which has "ti"
and "te" codes that switch to the alternate screen, which has no
scrollback.

If TERM is "xterm", tf will ignore termcap's "te" and "te" codes so
xterm scrollback works, but for any other value of TERM tf will honor
them.  Perhaps a future version of tf will have an option to ignore
them independant of the value of TERM.

have you guys considered that he might be using the console, and not using
an Xwindows app? If so, it is very posible to have the display problems he

You might want to reconsider, xterm is very configurable and has no
inherent disadvantages to console mode, and many advantages. (configurable
size of scrollback buffer, etc.) In fact most of what I do in X I do in
full screen xterms, with no scrollbars. You choose the font and the size
you want.

well this is my deal, i'm coder on purple dragon mud so i use up to 5
consoles for programming .. [2 for editing, 1 for compiling 1 for references
1 for gdb] plus TF console .. with all that junk the XF would take too many
resources, not even talking about the swapping time and resizing the
windows, beside that i was programming in dos for years and i'm addicted to
the 80x25 mode with custom font ;) I keep XF just for netscape and gimp .. if
i can run these 2 progs directly from console i wouldn't even have XF
installed, i guess i take any graph enviroment as a too big overhead for what
i'm doing .. well it is hard to teach old dog to new tricks :)

I think i just give up on the script and write me some add-on in C ..


				thanks for the help, old dog Dingo.

For Ken: /set ignore_te=on? This way people can determine themselves if it
is needed or not - anyways, not a big thing. Ofcourse, we'll have to switch
between the alternate screen and the main screen when we set the variable
so it's a bit tricky.

For the rest of the lot:

From man xterm:
--<snip>--
       titeInhibit (class TiteInhibit)
               Specifies  whether  or  not  xterm  should  remove
               remove ti and te termcap entries (used  to  switch
               between  alternate  screens  on  startup  of  many
               screen-oriented programs) from the TERMCAP string.
               If  set, xterm also ignores the escape sequence to
               switch to the alternate screen.
--<snip>--

Besides, real men have a custom modified terminfo for their needs.

-- Naked

PS. Oh, and those of you that don't know how to use the setting and are too
lazy to RTFM, put "xterm.vt100.titeInhibit: true" in your .Xdefaults or
.Xresources, whichever is appropriate (the other for startx, the other for
XDM, but it doesn't hurt to have the string in both).

PPS. "*vt100*titeInhibit: true" could be even more appropriate if you want
_all_ your vt100 widgets to do the titeInhibit behavior.

Hi there,

I have lots of triggers and gags defined and somehow it happens that instead of
gagging a line completely I get an empty line displayed. The content itself gets
suppressed as I expect it though.

Any idea what could cause the empty line to be printed ?

Harry

You get the idea.

Howdy folks.

I am trying the following /def so that I can make it not work at all
if it's tried with a fg world other then one of a specific type. I'm
using -E because using -T to limit it doesn't work. :/ but then again,
neither does -E seem to. :/

The /def is as follows:

/def -q -n0 -T'test' -E'$[world_info("type") =~ "test"]' testit=/echo testit

And /listdef shows it as follows:

% 4586: /def -mglob -T'test' -E'$[world_info("type") =~ "test"]' -q testit = /echo testit

I've tested the -E code as follows:

/eval /echo $[world_info('type') =~ 'test']

And with the testing it returns 0 and 1 in the appropriate cases. OTOH it
doesn't work in the /def -E case and it executes the macro no matter WHAT
the type of the world I've got in the fg. Now, if I've understoof the /help
on /def correctly if the code associated with -E evaluates to 0 the macro
will not be executed; anything else and it will. This doesn't seem to be
the case here though and I have no idea what I've missed. I've even tried
removing the other options from /def but that did not help.

I've read the helpfiles I thought were useful and related. I've tested the
code the simplest way I know how and I've tried this and that :) but I
stillc annot get the /def to do what I wish it to. :/ Help?

There isn't, but you can do the same thing:

/def -i file_exists = \
  /result !sys(strcat("test -f ",{1}))

If you are not using UNIX, there might be some other way to test for
existance of a file in the shell, otherwise have the "test" executable
available somewhere. Another way is to use tfio:

/def -i file_exists = \
  /let _F=$[tfopen({1}, "r")]%;\
  /if (_F != -1) \
    /test tfclose(_F)%;\
    /result 1%;\
  /else \
    /result 0%;\
  /endif

This is faster, but it will print an error message from tfopen() on tferr
when the file doesn't exit.

-T works fine. You need to include it in the world definition and make
sure to match it based on the value of matching. If matching is set to
glob, and you have a world which is -Ttiny.mush, to make triggers only for
worlds of type mush you would need to use -T*mush in the /def. If matching
is regexp, then just -Tmush.

-n0 would effectively turn off the trigger if that worked. You meant -p0
maybe? Also, what event is this supposed to trigger on? What you defined
is basically a macro, macros are executed regardless of matching
parameters like -T and -E. So you need to make it a hook or a trigger.
Also, an -E expression is already an expression, you don't need the $[].

-T and -E only affect whether the macro's trigger or hook (-t or -h) options
match; they are not used when the macro is called by name.

Perhaps the server sends an empty line after the line you are gagging? Try
something like this:

/def -ag -t'pattern' pattern_gag = \
  /def -n1 -ag -msimple -t"" blank_gag

No, there are no blank lines comming from the server. When I disable all gags
(or use telnet and do the triggers manually) I dont get any empty lines.
It also is no /echo because the empty lines do not appear regularly.

Any other ideas ? :)

I have no idea if this is even possible, but could the server be sending some
kind of weird CRLF codes such that tf gags what it thinks is the line, but the
newline gets through?  Sort of like when the 'end color' codes come after the
newline, causing color bleeding problems?

Could you post a couple of examples so we can see what commands you're
using, please?  There's not much solid information to go on at the
moment.

Thanks.

Hmmm, maybe this is the case. How could I verify this ?

Here it goes - my trigger sends a tell to myself every minute like this and I
found out that there *sometimes* comes an empty line:

^[[1;34mMyname tells you: @9/914972751^[[m^M
^[[34mYou tell Myname: @9/914972751^[[m^M
^M <-- there it is!

It includes a serial number and the current system time on my system. Then I
trigger the answer (the answer appears first before I get my own tell echo from
the mud) and calculate how many seconds I lag. :-) Since the mud I regularly
play lags alot it's a very nice thing to have.

It now seems not to be the trigger which causes this empty line and it also
looks to me like this empty line comes from the mud (or would emulation=debug
display anything this way even if it comes not from the mud?)

This leads me to a new question then: Is there a way to gag this empty line *IF*
it comes directly after the "You tell Myname: @..." line ? I dont want to gag
all empty lines and if I'd use the -n1 flag for the empty line TF would gag at
least 1 empty line - even if it's not directly after the above trigger.

Is this possible ?

Harry

According to a recent discussion on this list, yes. Consider the
following:

/def -F -ag -msimple -t'Caelum tests' foo = \
  /def -F -p2 -n1 -mglob -t'*' bar = \
    /if ({*} =~ "") \
      /def -p1 -n1 -ag -msimple -t'' baz%%;\
    /endif

'bar' and 'baz' essentially operate on the same line, due to 'bar' having
a higher priority and being fallthrough. So it checks if the line is
empty, and if so automatically generates a gag to remove it.

Define a one-shot trigger that matches anything and gags, then use
tinyfugue's builtin string-handling functions to check if it's empty.
If not, echo it to that world stream (so it still appears in logs).
This is expensive -- will hit the CPU usage some.  Also, to match text
with a pattern, I /think/ you need regexps '^(.*)$' which will shove out
warnings.

There's probably a simpler way.  I always go too complicated.  :^/

Any possibility of having this changed? I would love to have different macros
defined under the same name for say, different worlds... or to have them 
restricted to a certain type of world without having to do any cumbersome
coding.

It'd be really simple and it'd mean that say, my IRC macros only stay active
in worlds whose type is IRC and so on. Otherwise there's no match.

This would really be a nice improvement. I'd like to have the same macro names
in different worlds too! :-)

It would indeed be really nice if there was a way to facilitate this.  This
issue came up some time ago, and the solution I ended up with (still not sure
it is the best) is to define macros so that they call a macro with the same
name + world name appended... sort of a wrapper idea.

eg, 
/def macro1 to call macro1_${world_name}
then /def macro1_world_name for each world you want to use it in.

I have it a lot more automated than that but it's still an ugly kludge IMO.

I think 20.1 is the latest beta.  Is anyone working on making tinyfugue
use this
from what I heard this will allow /sh to actually work.
