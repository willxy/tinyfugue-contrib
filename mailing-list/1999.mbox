could someone please explain the following warning to me and how to fix 
it?


/DEF -ag -h"send {efd}" eat_create_food = \
	/SEND cast create food %;\
	/DEF -n1 -t"You create a*" get_it_eat_it = \
        /SET food_item=$$[substr($$[tolower(%%{L1})], 0, 
$$[strlen(%%{L1})-1])] %%;\
        /SEND get %%{food_item} %%; /SEND eat %%{food_item}

% get_it_eat_it: warning: $[...] substitution in expression is legal, but
redundant.  Try using (...) instead.



i tried

        /SET food_item=$$[substr((tolower(%%{L1})), 0, 
(strlen(%%{L1})-1])) %%;\

and
        /SET food_item=(substr($$[tolower(%%{L1})], 0, 
$$[strlen(%%{L1})-1])) %%;\

But nether work correctly.

Thanks!

On these occasions I use a different approach:

Define two triggers when we get the test line, first one will gag empty
lines and the second will remove triggers if we didn't get an empty line

/def -F -ag -msimple -t'Caelum tests' foo = \
  /def -p2 -n1 -ag -msimple -t'' foo_gag%; \
  /def -F -p1 -n1 -mglob -t'*' foo_undef = /purge -msimple foo_gag

This will work ofcourse - maybe a faster alternative is (if purge is faster
than a glob match and -n1):

/def -F -ag -msimple -t'Caelum tests' foo = \
  /def -p2 -n1 -ag -msimple -t'' foo_gag = /purge -msimple foo_undef%; \
  /def -F -p1 -n1 -mglob -t'*' foo_undef = /purge -msimple foo_gag

Notice however, that we cannot make the first macro fall-thru, even if it
didn't matter in our case for there might be some other lower priority
trigger triggering and doing things to empty lines.

Anyways, the speed difference between these is minimal and doesn't matter.

Um, well there are many other things to be reconsidered here, too.

/DEF -ag -h"send {efd}" eat_create_food = \
  /SEND cast create food %;\
  /DEF -n1 -t"You create a*" get_it_eat_it = \
    /SET food_item=$$[tolower(substr({L1},0,-1))]%%;\
    /SEND get %%{food_item} %%; /SEND eat %%{food_item}

Well we should use /let instead of set and maybe even /test
food_item:=tolower...

...and I didn't have time to test this so there may be some typos.

I get the following error message when I try to run the macro below, and
the matching string appears on the screen:

% tfwrite: $[tfopen("claims.log","a")]: bad handle

The macro is *supposed* to be designed to write a vital bit of information
(collected by loc_saved) to a log file. It does not write to the log.

Anyone who is willing to take the time to help me with this would be most
appreciated. Private email (instead of to the list) would prolly be
best...as this is most likely basic stuff to most list members, though I
certainly don't MIND seeing it on the list.

Ken Keys your next version of Tinyfugue will it have a real scroll back
feature
instead of the hideous /recall stuff ?.  If tinyfugue had that it would
be really kickass.
I am on a NT machine and I know the latest version of cygwin32 has all
the needed
stuff to support a scroll back feature.  I know others on this group
have asked for
it. right now I am using some scroll back macro that someone wrote thats
binded
to the pgup/pgdn keys but its still horrible (no offense to who wrote
it). Just if not
every client out there has a good scroll back system.

Windows NT already has all that is required to handle this unless the port
is doing something other then running as a text application.

I've never understood this request, if you want a large scroll back for
the console session running tf why don't folks just go into the things
properties and under layout set the buffer size to some huge value? Should
work just fine.

Rember that tf is written/desinged for the unix world, not the windows
world.

OK, the TF port on Windows is actually running in a psuedo UNIX 
environment.  That said, yes it's possible, but I wouldn't recommend this to
Ken.  Ken has said he is considering a different I/O layer for 5.0 anyways, 
so your request may be rendered irrelevant.  Anyways, if you REALLY want a
real scrollback function in NT/9X, the solution is very easy.  

run in /visual off,  prior to opening your TF app, type mode con: lines=100
resize the window border to whatever you wish, and poof, you have a 
scrollback.  Windows 9X limits this because it's Console is garbage, but NT 
can have very large scroll's and buffers. 

I happen to hope that TF 5 breaks from the BSD tradition of Sockets as File
Descriptors and adapts to using recv/send for socket I/O so that we can do 
away with the Cygnus workarounds and pick up a couple of additional platforms
as well.  But that is Ken's decision, and I doubt 5 will see the light for a 
few months still, while 4.0 is approaching 'Gold' status.

Hello all. Crescendo .9 is now available for download at 
http://lyrical.cland.net/~wlashell/crescendo

Crescendo is a true GUI front end to the TinyFugue mud client.
It has been written in C using the GTK/Gnome tool kits. It is
quite useable at this point, supporting full ANSI color escape
codes, and variable font sizes. In addition to the "source releases"
there are binary only versions available. I can also provide 
statically linked versions of it if there is a demand. Current
system requirements are that you use latest glib, gtk, and
gnome-libs. I develope along with gnome cvs so if you get your
libs from there, you will be quite current and should have no
problems. In addition crescendo is always available in its 
latest form from GNOME cvs.  (www.gnome.org)  

I'm planning for crescendo to hit 1.0 along with the rest of
gnome, and with any luck it will be available with the next
RedHat Linux release as well. 

Please send all bug reports, feature requests, questions, or
problems over to me, and I'll be glad to help answer them.

Oh, I don't know about this.. I wouldn't mind a nice ircII-ish scrollback
feature. When all you need to do is see a line from a page or two back,
it's sometimes easier just to scroll then come up with a /recall
line, IMHO.

well thanks.. i didn't think there was a big deal between let and set. 
setting the variable in the scope or leaving it hang around doesn't cause 
much problem. as for /test setting food item, i didn't think to try that 
way either, but it still doesn't answer my question about the 
substitution warning..

% get_it_eat_it: warning: $[...] substitution in expression is legal, but
redundant.  Try using (...) instead.


if someone could explain that to me, i'd appreciate it.. thanks..

There it is.  I forgot who wrote it.  When I mean scroll back I dont
mean scrollbars
its really simple for someone that knows how to code TF.
Dont ask me how this macro works its beyond me, I dont understand it
all.
One thing when you pgup you need to pgdn all the way out of it or it can

mess up on you.


This is how I think it should work.
PGUP goes into scrollback mode, during this mode any input from the mud
            your on gets buffered.
PGDN will move you down thru the scroll back mode.
ESC will take you out of scrollback.  If anyone uses pcplus for dos
works
          similiar to this.

When you're fighting a monster or 50 lines of crap just flew by you dont
have
time to think oh should I do /recall 50, or /recall 100 or was it 200.
sure you can turn /page on but then when you fighting or moving around
the
anoying page comes up and asks you to press [tab].

All scroll back needs is ansi function scroll region which is available
in
cygwin20.  And some ansi functions that can position the cursor around
the screen too I think you would need.

I dont want to run in a little window.  I like the fullscreen, thats why I use
this product.
When I am on a mud I dont have time to be using the mouse pressing buttons and

the such.  When I need to scroll back I need it instantly.  Whats so hard
about
making a scroll back, hell if I knew all that ken knew I could code it my self

I mean really its not that hard.  I have wrote programs in the past that
scroll up
and down thru a text file and its pretty simple stuff.  For Ken he would have
to
do it all  thru ansi vt100 functions or something.  Not sure.

Um your original culprit line is:

/SET food_item=$$[substr($$[tolower(%%{L1})], 0, $$[strlen(%%{L1})-1])]

which should be by your method:

/SET food_item=$$[substr(tolower({L1})], 0, strlen({L1})-1)]

We don't _need_ to substitute $[tolower..] etc. stuff because the thing we
are parsing is already an expression. So what the warning is about is that
the expressions is _legal_, but _redundant_. Also there is no need to
substitute %{L1} inside the expression because we can simply refer to the
real variable {L1}. See help on expressions.

Again untested, but I think somebody will correct me if I make a mistake.

I might not be posting for a long while now as I go to a place with very
little net access. Hopefully the regular expression stuff and others did
their share of influence.

Think you missed the point. Ken doesn't do the version for windows. In
fact if I recall correctly Ken doesn't care if there is a version for
windows (not trying to speak for him, just recalling past messages here).

Another gentleman does the windows port, since Ken writes for a unix
interface thats what is being used. That gentleman and I pointed out that
there is a way to do this already (the screen size issue is fairly minor,
adjust your font selection).

See above. recall is actually very powerful and if used correctly is much
faster then using scroll bars or some kind of page up/page down thing. If
you want a scroll back in windows I would think it would follow the
windows model which means using the scroll bar... which you can already
do by changing the properties of the session or if you are running under
unix by running it under xterm or the like and using its scroll bars.

If you don't want to use a mouse etc then you should probably reconsider
your use of windows:) FreeBSD or Linux might be a better choice... (I'm
not sure but I would suspect that there is a key board short cut for using
the scroll bar under windows. never cared that much so never looked for
it).

Heck, modify a version to your own tastes then:)

Hideous?  /recall is so versatile and flexible I wish all applications
had a /recall ability. 95% of the time when I need to look back in my 
buffer, I'm looking for a specific item (what did so-and-so say back there
again?) and /recall can show me just the stuff I'm looking for without
having to wade through goops of unrelated foo.

Even if when I -do- want to read the entirety of a portion of the buffer,
/recall works fine for that as well... or you can just scroll your window
back. :)

it is not abut how big scrollback buffer we have .. but about how easy we can

output from TF running in linux natural console [text mode no XF] cannot be
scrolled back, it is the way how the console is written and how TF outs the
data in the console [please don't suggest to me that i should use XF
[Xwindows] you will waste your time], even if TF would out the data so they
can be scrolled back with shift-PgUp/PgDn, the buffer is deleted as soon as
you switch to another console and back, only data in active screen remain.
So you will have external scroll back capability/support only if you run tf
via some non-natural program, like xterm, or most of the non-unix like OSs
where TF was ported so far.

Anyway, the point is that there is no scrollback feature [except /recall] and
we would really like it to be part of standard TF features, 99% of other
clients have it built-in, and patch/script or whatever is just not so much on
the edge.

Also the scroll back is not just for windows if it was made like I
suggetsed it
will work on any plateform, there is nothing in my suggestion that was
for windows
only.

I dont care what you think really. I was suggesting this to Ken Keys the author
of TF.  anyways it can be an OPTION (this means you dont have to use it)
so it wont effect you.  Plus from your response I didn't even suggest having
scrolls bars I am talking completly text based.  Love how people misunderstand
perfect understandable notes.  I never seen people so against a feature that
would be a benifit for its users.  If you dont like my suggestion then dont
respond
ok :) thanks.

Ken Keys can respond, thats who it was suggested to though :)

well i agree that recall if properly used could be powerfull thing, i would
still preffer some pgup/pgdn scrollback, but i go with what i have, so far
my biggest achievment was customized status line ;) i put most of my time in
coding for mud and i admit that i didn't put much time into figuring up how to
do the more advanced stuff in TF .. someone [sorry if forgot the name] gave me
this:

/def regoss  = /recall -mglob $[{1} ? strcat("/",{1}) : {histsize}] *gossip*

i feel like idiot but i just cant figure up how to make it work so i can use
something like this:

/re gossip 20

or even

/re [*]: 20

so it matches stuff like [Dingo]: blah blah blah

to get last 20 lines what match the keyword .. i would appreciate if someone
could kick me in the right direction ;)

Search forward & back, highlighting of the word/phrase sought, regexp
searches, multiple 'log views' for multiple worlds, the log doesn't move
while you are trying to cut and paste, screen initiates tf, the 'less'
sessions, my pine session and a shell session with one command, and one
TTY that I can telnet to from a remote location and reattach an already
active session to.

Sure works for me. :)

And I was telling you a way to do it, text based (ie text not gui) or not.
You meant full screen console session and I realized you were not making
that distinction. TF is a text based application, not a gui, any window it
runs in is text based (whether it takes the full screen or any
portion there of)...just the way it is. By the way, if you run a console
session in a window instead of full screen and add more then 25 buffer
lines then you get a scroll bar...it was implicit in the suggestion, thats
the traditional scrolling interface for windows. That was the point of my
reply.

Not against the feature, I could care less if it were there or not. I
would probably even use it occassionally if it were there (though most of
the time /recall 1000 *pattern* is much more useful).  I doubt I use more
the 20% of tf's features, that doesnt mean I want the others to go away. I
was trying to offer you a very workable alternative (especially under NT)
as this is an idea/opinion that is expressed every few weeks and Ken has
not indicated a desire to add it.

> Ken Keys can respond, thats who it was suggested to though :)

It's a mailing list. Thats the way it works.

I (like many others who have expressed their opinion so far) have an
appreciation for /recall.  It is a very powerful tool.  However, 
there are times where it would be nice to be able to just hit 
Shift-pageup and view something I just missed off the edge of the 
screen and then go back to the screen I had.  (unmodified.) 

I used to be a devoted Zmud user, but between a friends constant 
advocacy of this software, and my gradually getting to the point 
that zmud was the only reason I had a windows partition, I had to 
give it up.  (Zugg's adopting the stance of the ASP didn't help either.)
The ability to scroll in a split window is the one thing I miss from that
product.

What I would like to see is a little diff from Kairo.  Only partly because
it has nothing whatsover to do with NT.  

What I would like to see, is an ability to scroll back in a split window.
That way I could quickly view what was on that last page, and jump back w/out
changing my current page, while at the same time, still being able to view
what is going on currently.

For me, this would be an incredibly valuable feature, and I imagine that while
some of you might feel it superflous now, you would find yourselves depending
on it quickly if you had it.  

Incidentally, if someone has a way this can be done already, I'm listening.

Ok, I wonna be able to format an output nicely...

the original looks like:
   - Some tracks of a hungry warg leading east (done less than 1 hour
ago).
   - Some tracks of an Orc leading north (done less than 13 hours ago).

Mine:
[1 hour] east a hungry warg
[13 hours] north an Orc

Now I thoulg like to pad the hour value with a 0 infront and the text
'hour' with
one blank char at the end since it will be easier to read....


My def:
/def -F -aGg -mregexp -t"   - Some tracks of (.*) (leading|going)
(west|east|north|south|down|up) \(done less than ([0-9]+) (hour|hours)
ago\)\." track_sub =\
     /echo -p -aCcyan @{Cwhite}[@{n}@{Cyellow}%{P4}@{n}
@{Cgreen}%{P5}@{n}@{Cwhite}]@{n} @{Cmagenta}%{P3}@{n} %{P1}

/help pad, /help functions, /help expressions, /help substitution

Change %{P4} to $[pad({P4},2)]
Change %{P5} to $[pad({P5},-5)]

Here you go.

This is a mailing-list, for discussion.
If you don't like people discussing your posts, why are you posting to
the list?

And you have again missed the point that Ken is a Unix programmer.  Unix
is not a Microsoft system.  Unix is not Windows.  Ken does not write the
Windows port of tinyfugue.  You are requesting Windows features and
extensions to a Unix program.

Someone else posted an announcement of Crescendo, which looked
interesting and a bit like what you're after, but for GNU/X11 systems.
If you're such a good programmer, read the Crescendo source and write a
Windows programmed (GPL'd).

In the past, key (PgUp/PgDn) and/or scrollbar style scrollback in tf
was not very important, since tf's own /recall command provided a
richer (though more complex) way of accessing the same text, and many
users (most importantly, myself) run tf inside another application
(like xterm) that provides one or both types of scrollback.

However, the new virtual window features in 5.0 (still a long way from
release) will turn the buffers of those applications to spaghetti.  So,
5.0 will probably have key style scrollback built in.  Don't worry,
/recall will still be available; both methods of viewing old text are
useful in different situations.

Instead of waiting for the flood of questions about "virtual window
features", I'll just explain here:  5.0 already has a separate virtual
window per world connection, similar to Screen's windows or linux's
virtual consoles except that the input window (in visual mode) doesn't
change.  I am also considering adding the ability to have multiple
visible output windows with different (or the same) world connections
displayed in each, and maybe even full terminal emulation.

	Hi.

	Is there any way to use microseconds on delay? (repeat, etc.)
	or get more accurated time format than just second with /time?
	fe. 0,3 or 1,5 sec delay before executing trigger.

	I'm using unix (linux) and strftime shows me that second is
	smallest format:(

	thank you beforehand!

Not yet, but 5.0 will support fixed-point decimal times (to six decimal
places, I believe).

/recall -t does display fractions of a second already, but it's undocumented
(and I'll leave it to Hawkeye to announce it). :)

My biggest problem with scrollback/More at the moment is if I have a large
amount of output waiting to be viewed in a world (say, 500 lines in a noisy
world while my RL self was attending a meeting), I have to page through all
that output, or esc-j it, before I can resume participation in that world.
If I could view the buffered text in the upper half of a screen, while
viewing "current" output in the bottom half, then, well, I'd owe Hawkeye
more than just the one beer I bought him last time we met:

---- World druid ----
You say, "Hawkeye, quote Karen_Etheridge."
Hawkeye says, "I once heard Karen_Etheridge say, "I want to have Hawkeye's 
  baby.""
---- No world ----

Hawkeye's planned virtual windows will make this situation better - I can
switch to other worlds before finishing up with the spammed world - but
I still would not be able to see current output in the noisy world.

That reminds me of a keybinding that has been going around for this purpose:
to view text in the input window (assuming that the output window is at
a More prompt):
/def -i -b'^[g' bind_esc_g=\
  /let x=$[strcat(kbhead(),kbtail())] %;\
  /recordline -i /eval /grab $$(/eval %x) %;\
  /grab $(/eval %x)

e.g. type  /recall /5 ^[g

Fine respond but if you say I think your idea sucks and stuff well expect to get
flamed ok :) I dont go on here and shoot down other peoples ideas.  If I dont
like it I dont say anything.  And I am not requesting a windows feature are
you truley a moron ?

Scroll back using nothing but vt100 functions has nothing to do with
windows what so ever.

Thanks, hope you understand a lot better now :)

Thanks, thats what I wanted to hear and answers my questions.

To everyone else I am sick of fighting with people that dont
read my notes carefully.  Plus this mailing list makes it hard
sometimes to know whos talking to who.  If I offended anyone
by mistake I  apologize.

Actually, gtk has been ported to the win32 api. Most of the basic functionality
of Crescendo was implemented in plain gtk. There are a few function calls, and
the like that would need to be remedied, but really, it shouldn't be more than
a few hours hack if someone knows win32.  As for Crescendo itself, since it is
plain C, and the gnome-libs, it is actually pretty portable. There are a number
of unix systems (commercial and free) it -should- compile and run cleanly on
with tf.

That's interesting, would it be more preferable to hit like, ctrl-pgup to
activate the split-screen, and just regular pgup to scroll up "normally"

or would the split screen be the default?

I'm not sure what ken is working on with 5.0, in this manner.. but
its a feature that I would attempt to add to Crescendo if there was
interest in it.

Hey TF addicts ;)

i was trying to find something about this in helps but i'm either not looking
good enough or i'm looking in wrong places ;), is there way to have 2-line
status line ? or even change the [21 output]/[1 status]/[3 input] ratio in
visual mode ? i ran out of space on my status line and i'm looking for some
alternatives.


                                               Thanks, Dingo.

Dunno if this is what you're looking for, but

I'd like to stress that tinyfugue is free software, probably started as
Ken's personal project to serve his own needs, and he's nice enough to
make it public and implement suggested features.

Basically I think that suggestions for future features can be posted and
discussed, but you shouldn't forget that Ken and Ken only is the one who
will decide if a feature will be imped, unless you hack tf's source to imp
it yourself. (That's the thought behind free software anyways). 
Presonally, I didn't like the tone of some of the past emails. I also
think there was too much spam about something only Ken can decide on
anyways. 

I'd like to thank Ken Keys for the time and efford he's put in this
wonderful application. Thanks Ken!

Maybe not exactly scrolling. Often when I use many desktops I
don't want to see what's with the mud during that time when I'm
somewhere out.
So How to avoid all that screens spamming me when I'm changing
uniX session  (I don't know - via keybindings or something) 
and
How to cancel all the lines ready to recall when I don't want tp
see them ???

  According to the online help, this would be accomplished by /fg -q.
This way *all* text that gets sent to a background socket would vanish
into a bottomless pit... right?

Hope that helped,

you don't see the -q option, you need to update.

To see what the latest version is, for download and installation
instructions.

It shouldn't change a lot, besides some additional nifty features.
If you're running an old version tho, there's a chance you're using
%0 in macros and will have to replace it with %*

If you're using any version of unix, you don't want the .zip file. Get the
.tar.gz instead. Thats almost certainly why it didn't work.

I took advice and found 4.02gamma (or something like that )
It worked installing and not changing my settings, but now I have a prompt
showing up under my /visual line...How do I get rid of that ?

Peace

Ok here's a good one. 

I am using tf for multicharing on a mud ... I have found the /fg -q
command and the /send command to be useful switching chars and such (I
used to have triggers but don't know how to set those up for individual
characters using the same tf environment )... Anyways I was hoping there'd
be a way to set up the commands to do this and switch quicker than my
typing. Maybe a trigger or such that I could do it instead of again typing
it out or going through cntrl^P to find the last command to switch.
(Typing and scrolling suck because I when in a fight I tend to spam)

You mean like esc-w, esc-f, and esc-b?

Ok that works for switching 
what about the prompt under my visual line AND the kicking off of the
buffer from the second character so I don't get that backlog of scroll
that comes on when I switch

/fg -q dumps all buffered output when you switch worlds.
You can also use esc-j (or esc-J - see /help flush and /help selflush)
to dump everything behind the More prompt after you switch, assuming
you have /more on.

As for the prompt that shouldn't be there, recent versions of TF now
more intelligently attempts to determine the type of world you are on,
and whether it should have an lp-style prompt.  You can prevent much of
this from happening by using a -T flag for all your /addworld lines
(see /help addworld).

Hi,
I would like to know if it is intended that a read compatible command is
included in the future tf versions. That means: it returns the read value
and it can be called from asynchronous macros.
The use for this is e.g. /if (read()=/[Jj]) ...

My tf does not update (the screen does not scroll) unless it is "active"
(the tf window is the topmost).  I wonder if this is one of the problems
mentioned about tf&NT, or am I doing something stupid?  I typically like
to work on something else, and let tf run in a small window that I can
see just the couple last lines of, and then if I get belled/my triggers
tell me something worthwhile is going on, I take a closer look... which
is now impossible since tf seems to be totally inert if it's not
actually on top.

Thanks for any help, even for telling me it's not going to happen so I
can move back to telnetting to a unix machine and starting my tf from
there.

Yours gratefully, Jukka Sinisalo

Hiya ... and because we didn't hear from past year, i wish all of you A
happy new year .... 

now ... the questions ... 
i'm trying to make a tf-script that will allow me to get on irc ... and
i have here some problems ... 

1. how can i add a line in a "world waiting list" ... what i really meen
is : 
   a line comes from the socket ... i gaged it ... but i want to write
some stuff ( but not send to the socket ... ) 
if the world is in foreground .. well ... no problem ... i use a simple
/echo ... but if is in background ? .... well ... that's the question ... 

2. if i use /set wrapsize=80 ... and a line with more than 80 chars is
gaged ... well ... it suxx ... cause only the first 80 chars from the line
appears in the %* ... what can i do ? is there a /hook command that i can
use it to gag the text right when it comes from the server ( i meen before
tf split it ) ?

more question .. later ...
just one more now: does anybody here have some irc scripts in tf ... how

It's been done before.  I wrote a simple one, then someone else had
interest, so I passed it on to them, and they expanded it.  I don't know
if they are still on the list or not.

/substitute.

For example:
/def -mregexp -t'^:[^:]: (.*)' killcolon = /substitute %P1
Then if a line comes :foo: bar, the line you see is just bar.

I'd suggest using regular expression, and using %P notation.

Yes.  Unfortunately, no clue where mine is.  I know others have something
similar though.

In both NT and 95, you can set if a command prompt window will run in
the background. I suppose you have this set to 'off' or 'no'.

Don't ask me where you can set this, should be somewhere in the properties
of whichever command prompt you use.

Nice command prompt thingie to run tf in is 'ntsh' or New Technology
Shell, still in beta/development stage, runs nice and stable tho. And yes,
it has a scrollbar ;) Do a search on the web if you wanna have it.

/dokey SEARCHB is what you want, so in that case

/def -i -b'^R' = /dokey SEARCHB

Though I prefer to use the arrow-keys for that, since it works as a
backward/forward history as well, and you don't have to use Ctrl-P/Ctrl-N
(even though they ARE faster. ;)

Anyway, that works for me, building your own function for it seems
awkward and unnecessary.

I don't know how to deal with the color ansi codes before the prompt. For
that matter, does anyone have any usefull ANYTHING that they use with
medievia... I'm sure this is in poor taste, and I apologize, but I figured
this would be the best place to get help.  Thanks in advance...

Not in version 4.0, but on systems with gettimeofday(), version 5.0
(unreleased) supports microsecond resolution time everywhere time is
used, including time(), ftime(), idle(), sidle(), /recall, /repeat,
/quote, /at, /ps, %ptime, and %maildelay.

TF only splits the line to display it on the screen; %* always contains the
entire line.  It sounds like the server is splitting the line before sending
it to tf, so tf actually receives multiple lines.

^[p (/dokey searchb) is similar.  You have to type the beginning of the line,
then hit ^[p to search for a match.  Other than rebinding every key, there
is no way to read individual keys.

Btw, getch() is _not_ a standard C function, it's specific to Microsoft
platforms.

Hi,
once upon a time I wrote a key-value list package with all functions
needed for it. I implemented it using large strings containing the keys
and values delimeted by special characters.
I used these lists in my own tf-help system, my routing package and other
useful packages (especially using abbreviations for complex values
containing multiple data to set mud state).

But I could imaging speeding the whole thing up. Id like to know if using
lots of variables (>1000 containing the values) in tf is faster than using
large strings and scanning them constantly (although for the very large
strings (>64884 bytes) I already used indexed lists.

Has anyone written an emacs major mode supporting tf macro editing?
(checking trailing whitespaces, missing \ jumping to macros,...)

By the way I think the following functions would add to a better tf ;):

* strnstr scanning from a position as well as the other string functions
being able to work from a position (until now I have to substring all the
strings ;((

* tokenize giving a string and delimiters and getting back the tokens,
perhaps incremental but faster than regexp and without the 1-9 limitation

* an echo -p that supports linefeeds; I did implement this using a @{N}
attribute and multiple /echos

* a possibility to add spaces to string-ends; I did many workarounds every
time I encountered that.

* a kind of stack for global variables (did implement it myself as well)

* to get more exact time data (e.g. for profiling
self-written-time-consuming-macros) perhaps in milliseconds

* a way to make variables world local. As I have to deal mit lots of
variables and macros (>300) it is impossible to guarantee that the
variables are only local to a world (as changing them elsewhere could have
deadly consequences)

This set of commands caused a segmentation fault and a core dump:

/def wi = /let fgw=$[fg_world()] %;\
	/if (fgw =~ 'myworld2') /connect myworld3 %;\
	/else /connect myworld2 %; /endif
/addworld -T'lp.mud' myworld2 name passwd 131.247.7.47 3003
/addworld -T'lp.mud' myworld3 name passwd 131.247.7.47 3003

Any idea why? What I need is to be able to keep a connection open
to the mud, and have another connection take over the char. I was
trying to use this to allow me to use one terminal at a time, but
it doesnt seem to work well ;)

I also have this functions which may or may not be related:

/def -i -F -hconnect logworld_output = /log -w${world_name} \
        ~/logs/${world_name}.$[ftime("%y%m%d",time())].log%; \

	/log -l ~/logs/${world_name}.$[ftime("%y%m%d",time())].log%; \

Since global variables (and macros) are hashed, they are theoretically much
faster than scanning a long string for a key.

I don't know of any, but I don't use emacs.

I have written a tf syntax coloring file for vim, which colors errors
like the ones you listed in reverse red, plus other colors for lots of
other syntax that make tf code easier to read.  See the tf web page.
(Vim 5.x comes with a tf syntax file, but it cant't handle complex
syntax.  I'll submit mine to the vim people someday.)

Useful.

Maybe.  But you can also avoid the 9 subexpression limitation by using
regmatch incrementally.

So the inline attribute extends across the newline?  Hmm, maybe.

Spaces are preserved as long as you always operate in expressions.

Millisecond resolution is already implemented in 5.0 (unreleased).

Already planned for 5.0.

Hello,

for testing some macros which usually are loaded by my .tfrc file it would be
very helpful to allow something like

/load ~/.tfrc <macroname>

Then it should only load the macro <macroname> not run any commands like /set or
something and replace the given macro.
This would make testing a special macro simple and not necessary to put it in a
special file just for testing it.

> /load ~/.tfrc <macroname>

For testing my macros, I use a file called test.tf and have a lil macro in
my tfrc:

/def ltest = /load ~/tinyfugue/test.tf

and only add it to my script files when I'm sure it works.
Easy enough? :)

	I did a search as you suggested, and tried to use that one too,
but it didn't help any for this specific problem.  Fancy colors etc.,
however.  Am I undertanding you correctly in that you are successfully
using tf in an NT machine from that ntsh without the problem I

hiya

first i wanna thanks Tiger, "gosseman" and especially Ken for the help ... 

well ... i have some more questions for you :

1. you can define a world usign a new worldtype ? 
2. if i define a world with the same new as a worldtype ( something like
/def -T"irc" irc balbal ... ) it get confused ?
3. ( and most serious ) : how can i send a control character to a socket (
like ^A, let's say ... ) and how can i include a control character in a
gag ... 

well ... and a litlle sugestion to ken ... ( or a question ... whatever )
i understand that tf 5.0 will be multi-window or something like that ... 
well ... a good idea would be if you be able to use multi-window on a
simple terminal ( i meen split the terminal in n windows ) like in BitchX
( a irc client ) ... well ... ?

c u l8r, alligator !

I get that same problem as well, its annoying.  I figure the problem is in
cygwin32.  For anyone that is curious there is a way to get flashing
characters to work in TF full screen under NT.  Just run the edit program
in full screen, then run TF after and you'll have flashing character
support.
For some lame reason that no NT person has been able to tell me is
why they tried to disable flashing characters.   But if you alt-enter to
goto a window and back you'll lose the flashing and have to run edit
again.

I don't have a problem with TF running while I don't have it selected as the
main window.

What does somtimes happen is if you have the window set to allow you to cut and
paste
and you start a cut it might lock up until you do the paste.  You can somtimes
inadvertently
do this.

My guess as to why your flashing characters works after running edit is that
edit
calls up the ansi.sys emulation layer which then allows your terminal to work
fine.

	[Sinisalo, Jukka]  Strange... and you're using NT.  What version
of NT and tf (if that makes any difference)?
	After some more experimentation the way it "works" with me is:
once I start tf-40b3w on my NT 4.0 everything works just fine (apart
from the constant flickering of my cursor), but once I put my tf-window
to background, screen updating stops (ie. nothing moves in there, not
even when my timer-triggers do some stuff).  Even when I bring it back
up, the screen does not scroll until I press some key.  After that it
works fine, until I put it to background again, at which point the whole
thing repeats itself.

It's the version of cygwin32 your using, I had to go back to b19 to take
care of that problem..   There is an upgrade to the b20 version but I
haven't tried it yet.

My prompt still shows up under my /visual line. How do I stop this?

my addworld looks like 

/addworld world login password  World-address port 
/addworld -T world login password  World-address port 
/addworld -Tdiku world login password  World-address port 

Do these have something to do with it or should I include a /prompt line
or something in my .tfrc



Peace

You need to define a PROMPT, see /help hooks. Also since the server
probably doesn't send an IAC GA signal a trigger to catch those lines
which contain the prompt and other stuff should be caught and substituted.

One way to get rid of effects of local variables, is to set them in an
initializer macro and just call it from something loaded at startup, or
something like this:

/def myset = \
  /test tfclose("o")%;\
  /if /!set %1%;\
    /set %1 %2%;\
  /endif

then use /myset instead of /set in sections where defining globals
(untested, but the general idea works.)

Sorry about newbie's question, but I have defined:

/def -h"PROMPT *=> " catch_prompt = /prompt %*;

and I still have prompts appears in my upper window from time to time...
Mostly it happens with some string attached after prompt.
Prompt that comes from my mud is for example:

638hp 162m 7600nl=>

And the world is defined:

/test addworld("The_Great_Hunt", "diku", "207.170.57.44", "4000", "name", "pass", "mishka.tf")

Please help and sorry if it's too trivial question.

It looks like a timing problem, i.e. TF cannot decide what is the prompt
because text
arrives from the MUD with bad timing. This is usually caused by bad
network connections.

Actually, I would like to ask the same question Alex asked, even after
doing a /help status bar - it helped me about as much as it would have
had it been written in greek. 

The part about "this is slightly confusing, let's do an example" gave
me some hope, but then I got to the example and it shed no light 
whatsoever in the dim recesses of my brain ;)

What on earth posessed me, a non programmer (heck... an anti-programmer)
to try a programmers client like TF I will never know. :)

Mvh,
	Kimmo.

sure, here's mine:

/DEF -mregexp -h"PROMPT H:([0-9]*)/([0-9]*) S:([0-9]*)/([0-9]*)>" prompt_hook =\
 /test prompt({*}) %;\
 /SETENV hp=%P1%; /SETENV hpmax=%P2%; /SETENV sp=%P3%; /SETENV spmax=%P4

/SET status_fields= :1 "H:":2 hp:-4 "/":1 hpmax:4 :1 "S:":2 sp:-4 "/":1 spmax:4\
 :1 @active:2 :1 @log:5 :1 @more:8:Br :1 @world

The prompt_hook (hopefully) catches my prompt from an LP mud that doesn't send a
termination character, it works pretty well. I test the prompt, then grab the
numbers and stuff them into a few variables (my current and maximum hit points
and spell points). Grabbing them is done by a regular expression (regexp) match.

The status_fields line has a few labels, some nice formatting and uses the
variables I grabbed in my prompt hook. Looking at it from the left (the first
line) it has a space (:1) then a label "H:" (for hit points) that is 2
characters wide (:2) followed by my hp variable that is right justified and 4
characters long (hp:-4). Next is a slash to make things easier to read ("/":1)
that is one character wide. Then my maximum hit points (which can change due to
items, spells, etc) which is left justified (hpmax:4). Spell points are
displayed in the same manner.

The rest of the line is basically from the default, variables starting with @
refer to internal variables and show the activity status, log status, more
status and world connected to. They are pretty much from the default settings.

It looks something like:

_H:_924/924__S:_859/859___________________________________More 100_worldname

You can put more variables in it as needed (I use different status lines for
different characters and muds).

Hope this was a better example. Any further questions feel free to ask. I think
this is a great feature of TF.

Naaaa. I don't think tf is a "programmer's client". I know a lot of
non-programmers who manage to build, install and use tf easily. Setting up basic
macros is pretty simple (/man alias). I agree, complex macros can look pretty
daunting to the novice, but the power of tf is unsurpassed by any client I've
used (and I've tried a lot of them on a variety of platforms). Just look at the
examples and take it slow to program what you want.

Thanks, I'll study up on the info you sent and look again at the built-in
help, I'm sure I'll get it eventually.

Yeah, I did exaggerate a tad. I'm not quite as helpless as I sound,
I can do /def's to trigger from the mud and even use variable based
triggers and the like. I'm sure my triggers are both inefficient
and probably ugly, but hey... they work for me.

Yeah, I agree. However, the step from Tintin++ to TF was a doozy.
Going from:

#action {Bleh arrives.} {hug bleh}

to

/def -F -mregexp -t'Bleh arrives\.' its_bleh = hug bleh

was pretty nasty.. to say nothing of going from one config file
to the half a dozen that I use now :)

But of course, I did switch... primarily because Tintin is dead in
the water, as far as I know, and I wanted to do slightly more advanced
stuff than what Tintin allowed me to do. Of course... I still
can't do that advanced stuff now due to semi-poor comprehension of
TF, but at least the potential is there, right? :)

Mvh,
	Kimmo.

Ok I must have mistated the question... I don't want the prompts in my
lower box under my visual line. I had it set in the old version of TF, but
since I recently upgraded it is not set up to show just the prompt in my
upper box and spams my lower box. Anyone got ideas?

I had the same problem and was able to solve it because my mud offered the
possibility to terminate prompts. Would also like to know how the durn
prompt hook works exactly.

Btw /prompt sets the prompt for your input window and it's definately not
what you want ;)

Maybe you can have substitute insert a termination character?

Unterminated prompts are nasty sometimes, since text from the server can
appear on the same line as your prompt, so anchored triggers won't work.
Any other way to solve this?

There's a fix for this, but it's not perfect:

/def -mregexp -t'^[0-9]+hp [0-9]+m [0-9]+nl=>' unterminated_prompt \
  /substitute %PR

so if you get lines with colors in this way, they will get stripped, no
easy way to fix that.

TF supports TELNET_GA [telnet go-ahead] feature, farest i know, all ROM 2.4
muds have it implemented as a flag but there is no command to toggle it for
player, i added it to our mud, but it isn't default feature on ROM, i figured
way around it, from telnet.h you can get this 2 lines:

#define IAC     255             /* interpret as command: */
#define GA      249             /* you may reverse the line */

this is from kens tf help file:

  GOAHEAD: Send IAC GA (\377 \371) after each prompt.  This is the easier of
  the two options.  In many servers, this can be done at the beginning of the
  routine that reads user input.  Disadvantage: could possibly cause problems
  in clients that don't understand TELNET protocol (but usually, they will
  just pass it through to the terminal, which will usually ignore it).

so what you need to do is set your prompt on the mud where you playing and add
3 characters on the end of the prompt:

IAC GA which is 255 249 in ASCII scan codes

i use linux telnet client to do that, but i'm sure that there is a way to do
that in TF too somehow ;)

okay, by now you probably thinking 'what the hell he is talking about' :)
here is how it works: after you add the 2 chars on the end of the prompt TF
will recognize them and filter all prompts from output part of the screen, 
you will still be able to see the prompts in your input lines, like it should
be from beginning. 99% of the muds doesn't filter high ascii chars from player
files, and all pfiles are saved in text format, strings in pfiles are usually
terminated with ~ [tilde], so high ASCII chars aren't filtered or altered any
way. Or instead sneaking it in the prompt, you could ask imms on your mud to
add it to the code, it takes just about 5 mins to do it ;)

i use this on every mud where i can sneak it in the prompt or set it in my
player settings.

                                   hope this will help you, Dingo.

Ok I know I did ask the question wrong. 

If my input screen is the lower part, and my output is where my world
descriptions are and such... How then do I see my prompt in the output
part and not the input part.


Peace

you can use the telnet GA thing, then use hook to catch the prompt, and echo
the prompt on the screen, that would fix the prompt and other text from mud on
the same line, or show it in status line, don't ask me how to do that though,
farest i got in TF is custom statusline and CR trigger, but i'm sure that
guys here know how to do that :)

From /help addworld:

If addworld() with a password is executed from a file that has permissions 
making it readable by others, it will produce a warning.

This can be true for an addworld() without password, too. Try to make a
file named test.tf with a line like "/addworld testworld address.of.world
23". You can load this file without getting a warning.

Now do an "/addworld testworld character password address.of.world 23" on
the command-line. If you load the file "test.tf" again, you will get a
warning like "test.tf, line 1: addworld: Warning: file contains passwords
and is readable by others." although there is no password given in the
file.

Bug or feature?

I still have some question for you 

1. how can i obtain the number on a process ( PID ) generated by repeat ?
   i wish to know the pid for usign it in a kill command 

2. i look in stdlib.tf but i didn't find the /connect command ... they are
some references ... some usings on /connect .. but it seems to be no

Taken from /help repeat:

An asynchronous /repeat returns the pid of the new process, or 0 if an error 
occurred.  A synchronous /repeat returns the return value of the last 
command.

How do I turn off or on triggers ?
I don't wan't to remove them, just disable them for a while.
Like my loot triggers, I don't wan't them on when i'm just going between
the areas.
I have tried to have /def -t"*is DEAD, R.I.P" /if (in_battle) %; ... ...
but it's no good because i have alot of triggers for diffirent things and
they are slowing down TF so much.

One way is to name all your triggers, and write an overall macro to
define or undefine them as necessary.

Eg,

/def LootModeOn= \
	/def -t'whatever' Loot_1=..... %; \
	/def -t'whatever' Loot_2=.....

/def LootModeOff= \
	/undef Loot_1 %; \
	/undef Loot_2

instead of using /if

> How do I turn off or on triggers ?

You can use /edit -c0 trigger_name (always name your macros) to keep the
body from being executed, but the triggers will still fire (something to
be aware of).

One easy way to do this (in version 4.0) is to use -E instead of /if in the
body:

    /def -E'in_battle' -t"*is DEAD, R.I.P" ... ...

The expression is tested before the trigger is compared, so the trigger is
never compared if the expression is false, making it faster in that case.

This gives even performance than the -E solution, but is a little more
complex to write.

Both of these will prevent the macro's body from executing, but the triggers
will still be compared, so they won't help your slowdown problem.  (But in
version 4.0 gamma 3, they will help.)  Also, borg=off affects all triggers,
which is no good if you want to disable only some of them but leave others
enabled.

You can use /ismacro for that purpose, I have a trigger to track a mobile
and walk in the directions my track tells me. I turn it on and off with
/track. Be aware of the fact that I define the macro within the body of
another macro, which means you have to use an % or $ extra ;) Read /help
substitution for more info. It's also used in speedwalk.tf.
 
/def track = \
    /if /ismacro doTrack%; /then \
        /echo -e %%% Autotracking disabled.%;\
        /undef doTrack%;\
    /else  \
        /echo -e %%% Autotracking enabled.%;\
        /def -mregexp -t"^You see your quarry's trail head \
        (east|west|north|south|down|up) from here!" doTrack = %%{P1} %;\
    /endif
/track

Another sollution would be to use a variable in a definition, like

/def loot = \
        /set looting $[!looting] %;\
        /if (looting) /echo %%% Now looting corpses %;\
        /else /echo %%% No longer looting corpses %;\
        /endif

/def -t"yourTriggerThing" = \
	/if (looting) \
		YourStuffToLootCorpses %;\
	/endif

You can now toggle with /loot.

Personally I prefer the first method because it keeps the trigger as fast
as possible, uses the /if command only when you toggle, doesnt use global
variables, and defines the trigger only when needed.

I think Gossamer had another thingie on her homepage to disable triggers
without ditching 'em.

hiya

i am interessed : is this a way to make a process "invisible" ? i meen ...
that process should not appear in /ps list, because i want to make some
macros that will generate many /repeat processes ... and... a /ps will be
annoing with some 20-30 lines or whatever ... 

2: and that question is for Ken ... i guess only he can answer ... 
what is the difference between tf-macros and tf-function ... atention ...
only the difference of speed and cpu-use interesses me 


thanks ...

Have a trigger:

effective. Now I have info on the screen (used to tfwrite that):

When using either glob or regexp matching, '[' opens a 'range' for
checking.  You need to escape it with a backslash.  And to actually
get /that/ backslash to escape the '[' you need to escape it past the
string stage.

/def -t'^\\[INFO\\]:  \\[Level' my_trigger = /foo bar

> When triggered: %tfwrite:  : bad handle

I don't think that you've provided enough information to know what
causes this.  Could you please show us:
(1) The trigger definition
(2) The tf-script which opens the handle.
?

Hello,

is there a way to write something to the current logfile which does NOT appear
on the screen?
I would like to have some data from my prompt displayed in my logfiles but it
should not mess up the way how my screen looks right now.

Any suggestions ?

Harry

I just thought I'd point out that I can get my tf window to not freeze in the
background by first clearing the screen (ctrl-l) then clicking on the other
application which I want to work on, to bring that to the foreground.

Hi,
after 4 years of writing makros that evolved into complete packages. I
want to share this work with everyone who is interested.
Short summary:
* extended loading facilities
* key-value list package with various access functions
* complete help system (comparable to the tf-help system, but written in
tf)
the html documentation of the packages was generated out of the help
package
* advanced routing system with lots of additional functionality
* room examining system for all details contained in any room
* useful uses ;) of the key-value lists
* player properties which are usable everywhere

All that is to be found at:
http://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/~mh14/tf

complete with source and thorough (but at this time only german)
documentation (160 kb docs ;() But as this is no complicated german
perhaps the automatic tranlators can do a funny job??

I am currently working on:
automapper with java-frontend
new key-value list with hashed data
and so on

I would be happy if anyone is interested in this stuff ;)

Send me your comments ;)

Michael aka Mesirii ;)

Hi there! I was wondering why when I use the /repeat macro on the Win32
port of TF it does not perform even REMOTELY accurate timing on the
repeating process? It works quite fine when run on my Linux box, but when
run on a Win95 box it takes FOREVER at times, even when only performing
delays of one second. When displaying the contents via /ps, it sometimes
lists the process as being PENDING under the NEXT field. Is there a
variable that you can turn on to get TF to do accurate timing under Win32,
or is this a "feature" that cannot be changed?

Hi,

I run a web/mail/ftp server that provides tinyfugue accounts for people.  It's a PowerMac 7200 running LinuxPPC v4.0.  At least three or four times in the past three weeks, a tf session has lingered after the user logged off, going 'insane' and taking up 90% of the CPU, until I killed it.  Does anyone know why this may be happening, and a way I can stop it?

Thanks!

Happened on my linux box (486/66 running debian linux) a couple of times
too. I don't know if it happens if people just kill their link without
actually closing tinyfugue or anything.

You can use one of those scripts/programs which monitor the load of
processes. I got one which kills processes if they run longer than 3
minutes with a load more than 60%, only on UID >= 1000 of course.

It's a workaround but it helps ;)

When /ps says "pending", that means the timer in tf has expired, but the
process hasn't yet generated the next line for tf to read.  So the question
is, why is the process so slow?  It may be a problem in the program, windows,
or cygwin; without more information, I can't tell.

Without more information, I can't explain why the tf process wasn't killed
when the login session ended.  But, in version 4.0 gamma 3 (coming soon),
tf will behave more nicely if it gets into that state for whatever reason.

I've had it happen too - though I tend to notice it more with certain
users, or perhaps certain server types they connect to. After the last
time, I decided enough was enough, so my system binary now has debuggering
symbols so that I can attach to the damn thing and figure out why it's
breaking. Or at least try. (Now, to wait for it to happen again... watched
pots and all that...)

I have encountered this problem myself.. I don't quite know what causes
it, but an easy way to counter it is to do a /repeat -S <command>.  For
some reason or other, /quote and /repeat do not default to -S on the
windows version of tf.  Even using -0 will obtain funny results.  So it's
best to just use -S as a qualifier for /repeat or /quote to make it work
instantaneously.

> where exactly is the connect macro in the stdlib.tf file ?

Yellow elephants with blue polkadots.

You asked a bogus question.  ;^)

'connect' isn't a macro.  It's a builtin.

First clue:
tf-lib/stdlin.tf:
[...]
/def -i world = \
[...]
    /then /@connect %_args%; \
[...]

That '/@command' construct means "bypass any macros, call the builtin
command".  From within tf, use "/help @".

Second clue, if you really want one, is to check the source:
src/command.c:
[...]
static CONST Command cmd_table[] =
{
  { "BEEP"        , handle_beep_command        },
  { "BIND"        , handle_bind_command        },
  { "CONNECT"     , handle_connect_command     },
[...]


Hope this helps.

Hello:

I downloaded and successfully installed the latest version of Tinyfugue
for my Linux machine.  I have a question on whether or not it's possible
to do something with triggers in Tinyfugue.

I want Tinyfugue to be able to help me roll out ability scores when I
create a new character on the mud I play on.  After the initial log in
screen, the mud asks me the gender I want to be and then it presents this
on the screen:

^MChoose one of the following set:^M
^M1)  Str:16   Int: 8   Wis:11   Dex:15   Con: 6   Luc: 9^M
^M2)  Str:17   Int: 7   Wis:11   Dex: 6   Con:11   Luc:13^M
^M3)  Str:10   Int:15   Wis:10   Dex:10   Con: 8   Luc: 9^M
^M4)  Str: 8   Int:14   Wis:12   Dex:10   Con:11   Luc:10^M
^M5)  Str:13   Int: 9   Wis: 7   Dex:14   Con:11   Luc:13^M
^MChoose [1-5 set, Return roll again,q- quit]: ^M

At this point, I can either choose one of the score sets, or hit return to
let the mud roll more sets of scores.  What I would like to do is make it
so that each set of scores is kept tracked of, and would allow me to do
some simple checking like is Luc=18, or do all of the scores combined =90
or something.  If it doesn't meet my criteria, I would like the trigger to
send a return to the mud, so the mud rolls another set of scores.  If the
trigger sees what I'm looking for, I simply want it to stop and let me
choose the number set I want.

Anyone run into something similar to this, or is this not possible to do
with Tinyfugue?  I read the section on triggers, but didn't really
understand how to interpret what is being sent back from the mud, or how
to send information, like the return key, to the mud.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

- Mike

Not that it really bothers me, but do you have any plans for "TinyFugue 4.0,
no bloody alpha, beta or gamma" [1], or are we going to go straight into 5.0
Alpha 1? :-)

Err, as far as I know 4.0 gamma 1 was the first non alpha or beta

Hello:

I sent this question to the list a few days ago, and have yet to get any
response of any kind ("here's how you do it", "no it can't be done", "drop
dead", etc..).  If this question was inappropriate, or this information is
somewhere else other than the documentation that comes with Tinyfugue
(which I did read but didn't completely understand), would someone please
be kind enough to at least respond and let me know so?  Thanks.

- Mike

---------- Original Message ----------

Hello:

I downloaded and successfully installed the latest version of Tinyfugue
for my Linux machine.  I have a question on whether or not it's possible
to do something with triggers in Tinyfugue.

I want Tinyfugue to be able to help me roll out ability scores when I
create a new character on the mud I play on.  After the initial log in
screen, the mud asks me the gender I want to be and then it presents this
on the screen:

^MChoose one of the following set:^M
^M1)  Str:16   Int: 8   Wis:11   Dex:15   Con: 6   Luc: 9^M
^M2)  Str:17   Int: 7   Wis:11   Dex: 6   Con:11   Luc:13^M
^M3)  Str:10   Int:15   Wis:10   Dex:10   Con: 8   Luc: 9^M
^M4)  Str: 8   Int:14   Wis:12   Dex:10   Con:11   Luc:10^M
^M5)  Str:13   Int: 9   Wis: 7   Dex:14   Con:11   Luc:13^M
^MChoose [1-5 set, Return roll again,q- quit]: ^M

At this point, I can either choose one of the score sets, or hit return to
let the mud roll more sets of scores.  What I would like to do is make it
so that each set of scores is kept tracked of, and would allow me to do
some simple checking like is Luc=18, or do all of the scores combined =90
or something.  If it doesn't meet my criteria, I would like the trigger to
send a return to the mud, so the mud rolls another set of scores.  If the
trigger sees what I'm looking for, I simply want it to stop and let me
choose the number set I want.

Anyone run into something similar to this, or is this not possible to do
with Tinyfugue?  I read the section on triggers, but didn't really
understand how to interpret what is being sent back from the mud, or how
to send information, like the return key, to the mud.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

- Mike

I'm not on such a mud, but here's something to get you started (there may 
be syntax errors and other such minor things, as this is untested):

Is there a a Tinyfugue coding list anywhere?  I was reluctant to send my
response to the list, but my TF coding style could definitely use some
polishing.  (As I often reinvent existing wheels.)

For instance, that "$[str + int + wis + dex + con + luc]" construct is
interesting.  Mine didn't do that.  OTOH, mine needed only one main
trigger because I did "^([1-5])" at the beginning, and then referenced %P1 
if the criteria were good enough.

I've found that sharing code and reading and trying to improve other
people's code is one of the best ways to refine your knowledge of a
language.  Hence, my main question about a coders list.

The difference is that I'm regexping the "option", and then using it
later, so you don't need to repeat it for each option.

This list has been extensively used in the past for coding
tips/examples/suggestions/etc. It even surprises me that anyone
would think otherwise, but I guess we have been kind of slow on code
lately.

On the mud I play, we can use color codes like |W| for white and |Y| for
yellow.

I thought it'd be fun to write a lil thing that colorizes something with
random colors.

We can use all channels and such by typing one character.

"/col < blah" will send "<|W|b|R|l|G|a|Y|h", for example.

PROBLEM is that /set doesnt accept trailing spaces, so "/col < blah blah"
will do "<blahblah" with color codes. Can anyone help me ditching the
first /set ?

/set colorList=|B| |C| |G| |R| |Y| |W| |P| |BK| |BB| |BC| |BG| |BR| |BY|
|BW| |BP|

/def -i fillColorString = \
        /set colorString $[strcat (colorString, $(/nth $[rand(1,15)] 
%{colorList}), substr(inputLine, %{character}, 1))]

/def -i col = \
        /let inputLine %* %;\
        /set colorString $[substr(inputLine, 0, 1)] %;\
        /for character 1 $[strlen({inputLine}) - 1] /fillColorString %;\
        /send %{colorString}

Btw ditching the variables and/or obsolete definitions would be fine too
;p


Thanks,

I seem to be having a slight problem installing tf for windows on this
local NT machine.  The setup extracts the first files needed, then seems
to get stuck at the second 'setup' dialogue box.  The machine I'm on is an
HP Vectra XA with a Pentium Pro processor.  It also seems that this
machine uses a lot of stuff from a LAN that it's on.. could this be the
problem?  and if so.. anyway to fix?  thanx in advance..

Does someone please have a code fragment for setting a variable to the
count of open sockets?  I never have been able to get this to work
without spamming me with extraneous output.  This is for setting in the
status bar.

Thanks.

How about  /listsockets -s %| /wc -l?

You can also get information about each socket by doing:
/mapcar /yourmacro $(/listsockets -s)
where /yourmacro does something with a socket (world name is %1).


I use the following in my status bar (with status_activity:-30 in the
main variable).  It looks like: "ca:16 dr:902" etc, showing how many
lines are waiting in each world that has queued output.

/def -i -Fq -p2147483647 -mglob -t'*' status_activity_trig=\
  /if (${world_name} !~ fg_world) \
    /repeat -0 1 /status_activity_update %;\
  /endif
 
/def -i -Fq -p2147483647 -mglob -h'WORLD' status_activity_fg = \
  /repeat -0 1 /status_activity_update
 
/def -i world_abbr = \
  /if (regmatch("^\\(unnamed([0-9]+)\\)$$", {*})) \
    /result strcat('u', {P1})%; \
  /elseif (regmatch("^([a-z])[a-z]*guest$", {*})) \
    /result strcat({P1}, 'g') %;\
  /else \
    /result substr({*}, 0, 2)%; \
  /endif
 
/def -i status_activity_world=\
  /echo - $[world_abbr({*})]:$[nactive({*})]
 
/def -i status_activity_update=\
  /set status_activity=$(/mapcar /status_activity_world %active_worlds)

*Rubs his toe in the dirt sheepishly*


---------- Forwarded message ----------

On the mud I play, we can use color codes like |W| for white and |Y| for
yellow.

I thought it'd be fun to write a lil thing that colorizes something with
random colors.

We can use all channels and such by typing one character.

"/col < blah" will send "<|W|b|R|l|G|a|Y|h", for example.

PROBLEM is that /set doesnt accept trailing spaces, so "/col < blah blah"
will do "<blahblah" with color codes. Can anyone help me ditching the
first /set ?

/set colorList=|B| |C| |G| |R| |Y| |W| |P| |BK| |BB| |BC| |BG| |BR| |BY|
|BW| |BP|

/def -i fillColorString = \
        /set colorString $[strcat (colorString, $(/nth $[rand(1,15)] 
%{colorList}), substr(inputLine, %{character}, 1))]

/def -i col = \
        /let inputLine %* %;\
        /set colorString $[substr(inputLine, 0, 1)] %;\
        /for character 1 $[strlen({inputLine}) - 1] /fillColorString %;\
        /send %{colorString}

Btw ditching the variables and/or obsolete definitions would be fine too
;p


Thanks,

This defines a function countsockets() that returns the count:

    /def countsockets = /test tfclose("o")%; /listsockets -s

In general, tfclose("o") is a good way to suppress the output of a command
but still get its return value.

1. What to do to make /for instruction for parametres inputing
from keyboard. 
I mean, like here:
/for i 10 20 ostat $[i].sword - that's ok. In my function they
would be:
10 - 1st parameter (%1), 20 - second parameter (%2), sword - 3rd
parameter (%3).
Parameters may be of course different but I want alias that will
execute the command similar to that above, dependent on
parameters, like.
look_for 10 20 sword
or momething. I think everything is clear if not ask me what's
up.
2. How to use that /rand
I want to have such a thing if /rand 5 = 3 do_something, if
rand 5 = 4 do_something_else, else do_nothing. U understand
prolly. 
Don't know how to. There is some random needed.
3. A repeat - similar to random. I want to use that to produce
random repeats, but dunno how. I want a repeat that will be
randomized (delay from 3 to 10 seconds let's say).

I somebody know the answer for some of the questions or one help
me. Sorr that I want to give that much info, but I'm poor at this
:).

hehe

something like:

/def look_for = /for i %1 %2 ostat %{i}.%3
then
/look_for 10 20 sword
would do
/for i 1 20 ostat %i.sword

I assume you want to just run the 'rand' once, then compare that result
several times?  Simplest to just use a '/let' ...

/let r=$[rand()]
/if (r == 3) /something %;\
/elseif (r == 4) /something_else
/endif

I don't have tf handy, so the above is probably not syntactically correct,
but you get the idea.

/def repeat_random = /let r=$[rand(8)+3] %;\
  /repeat -%{r} 1 /some_command

> how do  I unsub from this list

Always remember to check how to unsubscribe before U subscribe :)
Help is available when U send a letter to:
Majordomo@tcp.com
with help in a body.
Generally You're to write on the same address: (also body)
unsubscribe tinyfugue
as I think :)

Currently my tinyfugue (4.0gamma3, running on Redhat 5.2 with a 2.2.1 kernel) freezes whenever it tries to do a DNS lookup.  Since one of my favorite games is having DNS problems, whenever I forget to connect to the numeric, it freezes for up to a minute while it frantically tries to query the DNS.

Does anyone know a way around this, or perhaps this should be a feature in the next version?

Hmm, you can try putting a listing in your /etc/hosts file for wherever
you are trying to connect to, ie

#for loopbacking
127.0.0.1	localhost
111.222.333.444	your.machine.name
130.233.40.180	bat.bat.org


where bat.bat.org is the machine I try to connect to  (ps, port 2000 for
the mud)

It's not /set that loses spaces, it's macro syntax.  Use expresion syntax
to preserve spaces.  Try this:

/def rth = /echo %R

/set colorList=|B| |C| |G| |R| |Y| |W| |P| |BK| |BB| |BC| |BG| |BR| |BY| \
    |BW| |BP|

/def col = \
    /set dst=%; \
    /set i=$[strlen({-1})]%; \
    /while (i > 0) \
        /test dst:=strcat($$(/rth %%colorList), substr({-1}, --i, 1), dst)%; \
    /done%; \
    /send - %1 %dst

I also made some other minor improvements:
* Instead of calling strlen in every iteration of the loop, I call it once
  before the loop starts, and work backwards through the string.
* Combined /nth and rand() into /rth.

I just started to switch from OS/2 to Linux (Redhat 5.2) and hit a problem
with 4.0 gamma 3 when I compiled it.  Using recordline then seems to mess
up the history -- when I use /recall after, I get it showing the lines
more from the front of the history than the end.  (/recall 10 shows me two
lines from settings and the first 8 lines in correct order, /recall 15
shows the first two lines, and the first 13 from the file..)  I asked a
friend to test his copy, and he also had problems using /recall after.

The line I'm using is "/quote -dexec /recordline -g - 'file", and it
doesn't give me this problem under OS/2.  Has anyone else seen this
problem?

Just tried to replicate the problem on my redhat-5.0, and -5.2 system, but
could not; it seemed to operate correctly.

if you like, try installing the RPM i've created
(www.ozemail.com.au/~chriscog/tf/), to see if its a compile problem,
rather than a run problem.

I did and had the same problem, but found out that if I do -S in the
/quote too, it disappears.  So I'm happy again.

Ah... its probably a timing issue again... quite possibly the background
task that does the quote had not completed when you did the recall.
(without the -S, it does one line per second, with -S, it does it all as
fast as possible, and wont return control until it finishes (could be
wrong on that last part) )

I want to do something like that:

1) Log an entire mud session into the file today.log
2) Replay the file today.log through tf.

Okay, so i can easily perform step 1.
I have no idea how to do step 2.

You know, i want to be able to replay a mud session into tf, so that all
my triggers etc do what they have to do and i could this way feel the same
way and see the same things, in the exact order that they happend when
they were logged. I perused the tf help but couldn't find anything like
that...

Do i have to dig deeper into the helps? 
Or, isn't this kind of thing even implemented?
If it's not, does any of you out there find it interesting?
Maybe it could get added in future versions?
If yes, i already have an idea of improvement (which is actually a thing i
would _very_ much like to use): the possibility to record time stamps or
such, which could reproduce the logged mud session _exactly_ as it was
played, i.e. with lag and such kind of things. It could be nice to "live"
an entire mud session again, at any time, provided it was logged properly.

This would possibly result in a new option for /log(e.g. -t standing for
time), and a new command: /replay :)

Is it too much, and again, does any of you think this could be an
interesting addition to this piece-of-art that's tf?

Bye, and waiting for answers/flames :)

.sig under deconstruction. Please watch out for falling stars.

hiya

i want to do a program and i need some information about i/o in tf 
so ... what i want to do is to write a line in a file ... ( not logging as
usual ) ... sure ... i maybe can do it with /log and echo -w ... but ...
nah ... so the question remains: how can i "echo" a line to a file :-)

then ... i want to read a file line by line and every line to do something
with it ... so .. how can i do that ?

thank you 


c u l8r, alligator !

I know in repeats I may use only full seconds. Heard in version
nr five .01 second would be possibl. 
1. I've got a question. Anybody wrote some lines of code that
make it possible without that version in the future?
2. That's a question rather about idea. What to do (some useless,
additional commands, sent to tinyfugue, processes or so to make
deleyas like o,5 second or ro). Coz its Processor speed
dependent, but ... What useless things among each repeat do U
propose :)
Need some advices here. heh.

Put this script somewhere in your path, call it tfrepeat and make
sure it's chmod +x and the path to perl version 5.x is correct:

-- cut here --
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w

use strict;

unless (defined $ARGV[2]) {
  print STDERR "Incorrect number of parameters.\n",
               "syntax: tfrepeat ppid delay iterations\n";
}

my ($tf_pid, $delay, $iterations) =3D @ARGV;

if(!fork) {
  while ($iterations--) {
    kill 'USR1', $tf_pid;
    select(undef, undef, undef, $delay);
  }
}

exit 0;
-- cut here --

Now, use this macro:

/def -i mrepeat =3D \
  /if (!{2}) \
    /echo -e mrepeat: syntax, /%0 time count command%;\
  /endif%;\
  /let _time=3D%1%;\
  /let _count=3D%2%;\
  /if /ismacro -msimple -h'SIGUSR1'%;/then \
    /echo -e SIGUSR1 already taken or another %0 is running.%;\
    /break%;\
  /endif%;\
  /def -n%_count -h'SIGUSR1' mrepeat_body =3D %{-2}%;\
  /sys tfrepeat \$PPID %_time %_count

Now you can do things like:

/mrepeat 0.1 3 /echo @whee!

The LP-Mud I´m playing on has changed its prompts from unterminated lines
to ´real´ prompts with telnet-EOR recently. I have defined my worlds with
-Tlpp to get rid of the timing mechanism, and it´s real fun to play with
the new prompts.

But there is one problem left: with the old prompts ("> ") you could see
the progress of the mud processing your commands, because of the prompts
adding up in one line (e.g. "> > > > > " after five commands). With the
new prompts you can´t see the progress, because every new prompt silently
replaces the old one.

Is there a way to user-define the text of the prompt displayed in the
input-line? I would like to change it with a prompt-hook to get the
advantages of both types of prompts: a real terminated prompt that
indicates the number of commands processed by the mud.

Thanks, Stephan

Hi,
as I am looking for a workaround for the tfread/read that does not read
from asynchronous macros I thought about using a shell script for reading
the input.
I have to use /sh to get the standard input. 
Because it is not possible to catch the output of /sh with $() I tried to
use an environment variable but it did not work either.

/set read_value=test
/export read_value
/sys echo $read_value ->test
/sh -q echo $read_value -> test
/sh -q read read_value (input xxx)
/set read_value -> test not xxx

why did the read command not update the environment variable?
I would prefer using a tfread or read that is usable from asynchronous
macros an not workaround.

I also created an asynchronous read that uses hSEND to catch the input and
than checks with a /repeat for input.
But with this I have to cut all makros that use read() into small pieces
and those pieces are no more blocking which prevents using the makros from
other makros ;)

Any ideas would be welcomed.

A helpless Michael

Sure.

/help prompt
/help hooks

You might want to consider putting the value into the status-bar
instead, as long as you're using a fairly recent tf.

/help status_line

Hope this helps.

Because /sh starts a subshell. While the environment of the parent shell
is passed to the subshell, changes to it in the lifetime of the child are
not preserved in the parent. You could do this:

/sh -q read read_value;echo $read_value > ~/read_value

Then use tfopen and tfread to read it back, however this is ugly because
it will show % resuming tinyfugue and stuff.

What exactly is an asynchronous macro? What's wrong with
tfread("i",_variable) to read from the keyboard? (this will allow things
to run in the background in tf, it will just wait for a line from input
that will go into _variable without being touched by tf).

Take a look at the code for the paste command in stdlib.tf.

If you explain what an asynchronous macro is and why you want it I'll be
able to have more :)

Maybe you missunderstood me:

My problem is neither to help TF identifying prompts (/help prompt) nor to
process them (/help hook). Both things can easily be done with TF so far.

My problem is to change the text displayed as prompt in the input-line. If
TF identifies <text> as prompt, <text> gets displayed in the input-line. I
want to display <mytext> instead and I can't find a way to do this in the
/help-pages.

> You might want to consider putting the value into the status-bar

I want to have a solution for both /visual on and off. 

> Hope this helps.

Use something like catching all output with a SEND hook and incrementing a
mud_commands global variable, then having the PROMPT hook use the /prompt
command to show the "queued" commands count and decrement it.

"/prompt" does not help TF identify prompts.  It sets the current
prompt.  The help page is perhaps a little confusing, as it uses both a
hook and a prompt.  "/hook" or the equivalent "/def -h" are used to both
identify and process the prompts (to use your terminology).

Maybe I'm stupid/tired, but I can't think of how to do this:

/def mymacro =
   ...
   /let myvar=foo
   ...
   /_mymacro

/def _mymacro =
   ok, here it is: I know I can refer to myvar here and have it be what
   I set it to in the calling scope, but how do I set it to something else
   w/o having it declare a new var in this scope?  using a global var is
   not an option.

TIA.

/let will create a new variable in the lower scope, as you have found.

This won't:   /test myvar := "foo"

/def -mregexp -ah -t'^There are (.*) players in the game. Within the
requested type you know:$' = /def -n1 -aCbgblue -t'*'

(all on one line)

What this does is set up a one shot trigger that will turn any single
line following the pattern to bold with a blue background.

The trick is in -n1 meaning it will only be set up for one following
line. Of course you could change n and the trigger to not match on
anything as above.

Does that help?

here is another one I like based on the same idea:

;This macro called one_shot puts a oneshot fall-thru trigger
;on the command line

/def prep = /def -n1 -F -t'**' one_shot = RESULT %;\
	/reedit one_shot %;\
	/undef one_shot %;\
	/dokey WLEFT %;\
	/dokey WLEFT %;\
	/dokey LEFT %;\
	/dokey LEFT %;\
	/dokey LEFT

So if there are 24 smelly elves in the room and you want to kill the
next one each one died, just edit it to be 

/def -n24 -F -t'*You killed the smelly elf*' one_shot = kill elf

Hi, I'm a new subscriber to the list here.  Although I've been a faithful
user of tf for years, I never had anything to say about it until recently.
:)

I'm an admin for a couple of talk-oriented mushes, and through my work as
a sysadmin for an ISP, I'm aware of just how insecure most networks are.
Looking around at my on-line habits, I noticed that the only transactions
of mine that I wasn't able to encrypt were my MUD connections.  So, being
the paranoids that we are :), I and a co-admin are doing some hacking to
add SSL support to tinyfugue.  I'd like to make the patch available to the
community.  Of course, owing to export law tomfoolery, I can't give it to
anyone outside the US right now, nor would it be suitable for direct
inclusion in the tinyfugue package.  If there is interest from anyone
outside the US, though, please contact me in private: I might be able to
work out a way of transporting it across national borders that doesn't get
me in trouble. ;)

The patch needs SSLeay to be installed on the system to work properly.
It's been tested with SSLeay 0.9.0b; it should also work with SSLeay
0.8.x, although this is unconfirmed.  I've made an effort not to break
the syntax of any of the internal commands so that backwards compatibility
with existing scripts is maintained.  Another of my goals has been to
transparently autonegotiate the use of encryption on the connection.  This
has worked very well for my purposes, but there may be problems when
dealing with extremely slow or high-latency connections.  Feedback is
sought.

Further details regarding setup of client and server are available upon
request.  (The server-side is currently based on tools distributed from
outside the US.)

Happy MUDding,
-Steve Langasek

As would I. However, it'll be nice to have something.  I also have all my
connections encrypted except my TF ones.

Has anyone by chance done anything to hack ssh/ssl support into the LPMud
driver?

A while back I had looked at using ssh for tunneling, but came to the
conclusion that it was undesireable to tie the MUD into the underlying 
authentication that ssh depends on.  MUD-over-ssh can be done easily, but
not without exposing any latent holes in your ssh server to the probing
and prodding of every user on your MUD.  In addition, it would take
some hacking to get an ssh-based solution that doesn't require root access
on the server end.  With the restrictions some countries place on crypto
export, you end up with a bit of a mess.

SSL provides a quick, and not at all dirty, general-purpose solution.  I
would be happy to work with anyone interested in laying out an ssh-based
solution, but I think there are assumptions in the ssh model which make
SSL a better overall choice.

Anyone succed in implementing maps of mud areas. U know, U're
wandering around in an area and finally the map like ascii map is
created. Coz assumption is there is no rooms with random exits in
area. Maybe such a tool is produced uunder unix or winows. If so,
gimme addresses, please.

I made something like that a long time ago.
Basically it's a hook that saves the directions you walk in, then echos
those out to a file, then I have a C program that takes those directions
and creates an ASCII map, like so:

dirs:
s s s s n w s n w n e w n e w w w s n w s w n s e s e w s w w n n s e w n
s s s e w s e s n w e e s n e e w n n e s n e e s s s s w e n e n s w n w
w w e e e n n w e n e s n

map:
---------------------------------------------------------
              C
              |
  o o-o-o-o-o o
  | | |   |   |
o o-o o   o-o o

  | |       | |
  o o       o-o
            |  
          o-o  
---------------------------------------------------------

You can mark rooms with markers (0-9 and a-z) (C above).

Woops, guess the list doesn't like attachments. Here they are inline.

Attached are two files, pmap.tf and dopmap.c
pmap has the instructions and hooks for grabbing the directions.
dopmap.c needs to be compiled; it's what reads the directions & creates
the map.

Although I'm not disputing that SSL (implemented in the client and the
server) is a good solution, however...

... is not quite true. SSHD can run in user space, but then, of course,
doesnt have the option to switch users. You're stuck with the one. But
since most servers (that tf talks to) dont try and use the OS's user
space, but its own, this isnt an issue.

I assume there's a little SSL-aware app that accepts SSL connections and
then passes them through to another port? (This way, you dont have to
modify the server at all :)

Cool!  I'm glad to hear someone else is working on SSLed clients, especially
tinyfugue.

I've been working with someone to provide an SSLeay based encryption system
for the FBMUCK server.  The problems we're trying to work out are how to get
SSLeay to be nonblocking while performing the negotiations phase.  This is
critical, since some of the systems running my server have 400 to 500 simul-
taneous users.  Having the server block for encryption negotiation would lock
up the system for the other users.  Did you find a way around that problem?

Hmm.  Looking at the sshd I have on hand, I see that you're right: everything
that normally requires root permission can be reconfigured at runtime.  Sorry
about that. :)

There are a couple of ssl port-forwarding wrappers available; the one I'm
using is called sslwrap, and can be found on ftp.replay.com (I think it may
only be available in [source] rpm form).  I still plan on adding ssl support
directly to the server (tinymush in this case), so that connection security
can be queried from inside the MUD.

I presume you mean something /other/ than sslwrap ;) (I can see how a any
server could do without 500 extra processes ;)

I am just implementing a java based mapper for creating maps. You can draw
them by hand or use tf and a port to remote control the mappers commands.
But until now it's only alpha and the demo html page is only german.
But if anyone wants to take a look:
www.inf.tu-dresden.de/~mh14/tf/maps/Mapper.html
Hope it works ;)

This is what concerns me. SSL is restricted all the same, for any
useful key size. If you tie tinyfugue to SSL, we end up in this
situation:

1) This tf can't be exported, unless it uses unsafe key sizes.

2) If it is distributed in a "stripped" form, "installing" the SSL
code will most likely not be trivial. Well, an SSL library would get
around this, now that I think of it...

As it goes, ssh is distributed from outside US, so I can easily get
it, and adding ssh tunnel capability to TF would not impose any
restriction on it's distribution.

This is in fact the approach I've taken.  There are at least two SSL
libraries, SSLeay <http://www.ssleay.org> and OpenSSL
<http://www.openssl.org>, distributed under a BSD-style license from
outside the US.  My current code is based on SSLeay, which is the more widely
used of the two at present.

The modifications to tf comprise a mere 500-line patch.  There are still some
issues involved in distributing even this from inside the US, despite the fact
that the patch itself contains no crypto code (c.f. the lack of hooks for SSL
in the main mozilla tree), but since the patch is only 500 lines, I'm sure I
can get it out of the country by legal means.  After that, if Ken is
interested, official distribution points for the secure version could be set
up.
I'm also perfectly willing to take an active role in maintaining the code as
necessary to keep it up to speed w/ tinyfugue.

I'll concede that this is also possible.  But it seems to me that it would
require additional work on the part of the user to configure TF for use with
ssh tunnels.  Since I administer a site with many tinyfugue users, the less
explanation I have to do the better. :)  My goal has been to make it
completely transparent and backwards-compatible... just point the client at
the port the SSL'ed mush is running on, and bang, instant encryption...  Is
this something you see being possible with an ssh-derived solution?

No, it requires the user to set up ssh. After ssh is setup, though,
it could be as easy as setting TF_SH='ssh' in the profile (in
addition to the ssh stuff).

This process in itself is very simple, very straight-forward, but
the user would have to send his public key to the server, which I
suspect would be the main problem.

On the other hand, you get authentication for free... :-)

But the user would still have to tell tf how to set up the ssh tunnel--when to
use tunneling, how to connect to the local end of the tunnel instead of to the
real server (although this might possibly be automated), creating an ssh key
if they don't already have one, possibly selecting between multiple keys...

That can be a problem, too, yes. :)

Personally, an SSL solution satisfies my needs perfectly.  But the way I look
at it, the less plaintext traffic there is on the network, the happier I am,
so--I'm game if you want to start working on an ssh'ified tf.

The developers of Crescendo would like to present the 1.0.1 release.

Crescendo is a GNOME X11 front-end to TinyFugue.

This release of Crescendo features full front-end support for tf. Basically
this means all of your tf macros will work with crescendo. There is full
ansi color support, and split screen scrolling. (standard scrolling is still
available using the scroll bar). Also included in this release is a
rudimentary connection window. 

Crescendo is GPL'd, so its free for all. It should compile and work on
any *nix system with GNOME installed. Crescendo does require GNOME. On
the web site, both tarballs and rpms are available.
http://crescendo.edenproject.org is the web site.
Please mail crescendo@edenproject.org with questions if you have any
of them.

I've not done tunneling yet, but I'd think you'd only have to generate keys
and manage them if you use something like RSA authentication.  Unless
tunneling requires that, why would they /need/ keys?  Why couldn't they
just use regular password auth if they wanted to?  I've got a bunch of
users who use SSH in place of telnet, and they just have to type a diff
command.  No set up for them unless they /want/ to use something like RSA.

In order to use password authentication, the user would have to have the
password to a valid *unix* account on the system, rather than just an account
on the MUD.  That will work in some, but not all, situations; it's completely
unviable if the administrator of the MUD doesn't have a close relationship
with the administrator of the host it's running on.

(Well, as a MUD administrator, you /could/ just give all your users the
password to the unix account you use to administer the MUD. I wouldn't
recommend it, however...)

Not really, if tf has been properly modifies. Take, for example,
CVS. If you want it to access remote servers through SSH, you just
set CVS_SH=ssh. That's it. Nothing more. You need ssh running, of
course. As for multiple keys, I think this is not important. If the
key has been ssh_add'ed, it will be used if necessary.

 I'm trying to modify the supplied complete.tf to use my output (eg. from
the mud) history instead of the input history, but I'm having no luck.
Anyone have a) a ready-made macro or b) a clue how to do this? Any help is
appreciated. I would also like it to only complete the last word in a
sentence, so I could for example do "kill blah" and it would find the
"Blahbloh" from 2 or 3 lines up in the history (maybe max 5 or
something) and fill in my command as "kill blahbloh".
 Impossible/implementable/easy to do/how the ?&$! do i ask such a simple

Eurk!  I remember those days ... *shudder*

Have you tried seeing how much space is available in /tmp and /var/tmp ?
Given that you're on SunOS 5.5.1 /tmp will probably be a swap-based
filesystem, so /var/tmp might be better.

Also, you might want to look at the options for storing the files (other
than stdlib.tf) compressed.  And if bzip2 is available, using that
rather than gzip.

Not myself, no.  Sorry.

Hope the above comments help.

Hi,

I'm having a problem with a wayscript-system I've programmed. It works
basicaly by defining points on the MUD and macros for walking between them.
An external perlscript generates the necessary macro-calls to get from the
starting point to the goal, and hands them to TF via /quote.

Unfortunately, on some ways a little delay between two commands is
necessary. /repeat -<delay> 1 <rest of macro> won't work, because the next 
macro will be called directly, while the first macro ist still sleeping.

I've kludged around this by not executing the macros directly from the
/quote, but putting them into a queue and have each macro execute the
next command on that queue when it exits.
This procedure works (sort of), but doesn't quite meet my aesthetic 
demands ;).

Is there a simpler, cleaner way to solve this problem, or am I stuck
with this horror for the rest of my mudding life?

Bye,
     Tido

This has now been uploaded to Demon Internet (big UK ISP)[1], and should
appear soonish, replacing the g3 release.

It _should_ be:
 ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk/pub/games/mud/tf-40s1.tar.gz
 ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk/pub/games/mud/tf-40s1.zip

MD5 (tf-40s1.tar.gz) = db6fa9a1aac0b7f199567d81c4b5c81d
MD5 (tf-40s1.zip) = 277fa420cfeeeacb29659c7db1943b7a

Hope this helps, especially for European users.

    done by the end of tomorrow.  Not that I would ever 'hassle',

In my util.tf Package is a completion makro that not only allows to scan
the recent output of the mud but also accesses depending on the context:
the inventory, the list of people in the mud, a node of my routing system,
a variable, a macro.
Subsequent pressing of the completion key cycles all possible completions
ending with the uncompleted input.
see http://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/~mh14/tf
the other packages are also useful although the documentation is only
german (try to use babelfish.altavista.com for translation or ask me)
but i didn't have the time to translate 170 kb of documentation if there
are no requests
Happy completing ;)

well, I used to, but that was back in the days when I had the time,
and I never was much of a programmer anyway.

However, that never stopped me loving my tf scripts :)

I've packaged up the latest version of tinyfugue (thanks, Ken), as well as
the help files, as RPMs and made them available at a NEW location:

ftp://ftp.furry.org.au/pub/tinyfugue/

Note the package name change; you will need to explicitely erase the old
package if you want that. I'll still be calling future alpha/beta/gamma
releases of the software tinyfugue-{alpha,beta,gamma} so that RedHat's
contrib system doesnt erase the stable release in favour of later
non-stable releases. Its a mess, I know :)

Hello  so far I've only used tf in a unix shell. What's it like in windows
95 I have to use a screen reader to read the screen, so I have to know
does it use normal window classes or are they custome, how graphic is it,
how much of the tf features can be reached with the keyboard. All of my
friends are using hmm well I won't say with client but unfortunately it's
not tf.

Essentially, it's a clone of the UNIX version, it has no Windows Specific setup and is nothing more than an 
MS-DOS prompt.  In other words it should work just fine for you...

Hello all!

I once hered of a array macro someware, but I can't seem to find it.

I play on Mume and Have to keep track of when it's night or day, so
what I need to do is make some sort of macro to read the time and
month and put in a little warning when it's DAY :)

The output of the TIME command in mume looks as follows:

According to the Dúnadan calendar, it is:
4am on Monday, the 25th of Afterlithe, Year 2922 of the Third Age.
The present Tan Istar, Lord of the Istari Council is Jadaen.
Real time is 9:01:04 (GMT).
Last reboot due to auto-reboot at Thu Mar 11 04:46:09 1999


If i do a help month I get the following:

DAWN MONTH

The names of the months in Westron and Sindarin are detailed below,
along with the times of dawn and dusk during each month.

  Names                                      Dawn          Night

  Spring:  "Astron"          "Gwirith"          7             19
           "Thrimidge"       "Lothron"          7             20
           "Forelithe"       "Nórui"            6             20
  Summer:  "Afterlithe"      "Cerveth"          5             21
           "Wedmath"         "Úrui"             4             22
           "Halimath"        "Ivanneth"         5             21
  Autumn:  "Winterfilth"     "Narbeleth"        6             20
           "Blotmath"        "Hithui"           7             20
           "Foreyule"        "Birithron"        7             19
  Winter:  "Afteryule"       "Narwain"          8             18
           "Solmath"         "Nínui"            9             17
           "Rethe"           "Gwaeron"          8             18

The times of dawn and dusk/night are also available for each month.

See also: TIME DAY


Ok so I can see that att this particular time it's the month
"Afterlithe" and in the help it say
that Dawn is 5 and the night is 21, also I can see that is't 4am.

So somehow I need to make an array or something so that I know that if
it's this month
and the time is someware from 21 to 5 (i.e. 9am to 5pm) and add a
DAY/NIGHT marking.

Anyone have a good idea here?

Your's
  Svarten

Hi,
I started writing a java application/applet that allows mud users to map
their environment in a graphical way (without pencil and paper)
As I want to create something people are satisfied with I would like
someone to have a look at it. I would be happy to get some comments on
that.

Try:  /quote -S 'nameoffile

DO a /help quote for the lowdown on the command; its quite powerful :)

If you like have a bunch of commands you want to use in a row and they're
in a file.. then just type

/quote 'filename 

if you're looking at the world you want to send the commands to.

If you want to "say" the textfile to everyone in the room..
type

/quote say 'filename

if you wanna do something tricker.. type /help quote and see if that
answers your question. :)

You didn't say want kind of mud or what kind of file... /quote, as others
have pointed out, is very powerful. If you are interested in doing file
uploads/downloads you may find filexfer.tf quite useful.... do a /help
getfile for more info. It works wonders in the lp world (it is built for
unix, lp, and muck worlds), I always found it easier to use it then a muds
ftp daemon.

Hi!

I got this little problem :)

I have a trigger that get's a monthname into %{P5}, I then have an
variable for each month.

Ok so I wonna use the contents of the variable corresponding to the name
of  month I get.

Something like this:

/def -F mregexp -t"([0-9]+)(am|pm) on ([A-Z]+), the (.*) of ([A-Z]+)\."
time_change=\
    /if (%{P2} =~ "am") \
        /let time=$[%{P2}+12] %;\
    /endif %;\
    /echo It's %time on %{P3}, the %{P4} of  %{P5}  [MonthData:
%{%{P5}}]

Actually I gonna make it little more complex the variable looks like
follows:

/set Astron=7 19 Jan Spring
( The fields: Dawn, Night, RealMonth, Season )

Well anyhow I mailed about the array stuff earlier but I could not find
anything that worked so
I decided on this instead. though it seems to be as hard *stare*

Hope for help soon,
  Björne

Hi everyone,

We are running TF 4.0g1 for Win32 on an NT Server 4 SP3.

I know, I know.  I'm stuck with the OS.  As for TF, this seems to
happen no matter which version we use...

We have a macro running which connects to a machine 
once every hour.  Every so often, something corrupts 
that macro.  There is no other application software 
running on the system.

Is this a known issue?  Has this happened to
anyone else?  I looked on the website but couldn't
find anything similar.

Has anyone else had this happen to them or had
experience with this?  This happens once every three
days or so.  (I know there has to be some hardcore
mudders out there who have been logged in for
days at a time :)

Going on the philosophy that rebooting fixes most
mysterious problems, I have shut down TF, the 
server, and combinations of the two
regularly, without solving the problem.


Here is part of our log file:

% Connection to CERF closed.                                 
^^^Last successful run

% Connection to CERF failed: ô:%0ô:%0rf.net: Unknown host
^^^Now it doesn't work?  Looks like the ip got munged.

---- No world ----
% Connection to CERF failed: : no such service
^^^ Different message the next time it tries....

% Connection to CERF failed: : no such service
% addworld: Redefined world CERF
^^^So we try to redefine the world, with the correct address

% Connection to CERF failed:  ô.: no such service
^^^And it doesn't like that either!

% Connection to CERF failed: (þ: no such service

Days?  The record connection on our system (under Solaris 2.5.1) is
somewhere around 140 days, which multiple people on the mud acheived
(I think a power failure finally brought us down).  I've only gotten up
to 40 days myself, since I do my best to find every last possible
remaining bug in TF (remember that gethostbyname fix recently?) :)

Is it possible to paste the relevant TF code so we can have a look at it?
It is possible that the code is corrupting itself in some way.  There
shouldn't be any reason why the IP itself is getting corrupted that I
can see...

/help gethostbyname

  gethostbyname 
          Set to "blocking" or "nonblocking" to determine how /connect does 
          hostname resolution.  On OS/2, default is "nonblocking".  On UNIX, 
          default is "blocking", because nonblocking is usually slower unless 
          you have a fast machine and slow name service.  See also %connect.  
 
For more complete information, see "special variables".

Thank you for offering to take a look at it!  It broke again this 
morning :(.  Is it something we are doing wrong?  We were 
trying to follow the examples in the /help.  It wouldn't be the
first time we'd corrupted ourselves.  (Or tried to... :)

I wonder if there is a Guiness World record for most time playing
an internet game...  or the longest MUD uptime?

The macros are:

/addtelnet CERF smtp1.cerf.net 23

; Print the time, disconnect (in case we got stuck open), then connect.
/def dump_queue = /echo Local time is: $(/time \%c)%;/dc%;/connect CERF

; Do this once every hour and 5 minutes.
/def dump_queue_forever = /dump_queue%; /repeat -1:05 1 /dump_queue_forever

planning to port it to NT ?

Ok here's the  deal

I wanted to have my prompt show in the upper portion of the window and not
in the bottom portion (below my status line). I got 4.0g2 (I think) and I
thought it would do that but it doesn't. My question is how do I stop it
from bottom scrolling and keep the top.

Peace
-Mike

Depending on the changes needed, I intend on porting it to both BeOS and NT.  As it is, I'm working on 
removing the Cygwin.dll dependencies in 4.0s1.  Hopefully, that should be done in the next month or so and 
I'll make it publicly available, as this will also include native BeOS support.  Essentially, I'm removing 
the major stumbling block in the TF Code and that is the dependancy on a certain non-posix, but BSDish 
behaviour regarding use of select() and file descriptors.  Unfortunately, that also involves rewriting a 
large portion of tfselect.c.  Progress is going well, but slowly.

Andy

With these known problems with snooping in several MUDs, I'm suggesting
two new functions,

 encrypt(s, t)
	(str) Returns the string <s> encrypted by the key <t> ("garbage")
 decrypt(s, t)
	(str) Returns the string <s> decrypted by the key <t> ("plain text")

I'm no expert on crypting so I can't suggest any algorithms, but there should
be some decent ones without export- or other restrictions. Security isn't
that huge issue here anyway.


I was thinking of construction like this:

/def ctell = tell player crypt: $[encrypt({-1},"fU6a|g")]
/def -ag -mregexp -t'^You tell Player \'crypt: (.*)\'' showowntell = /let msg=You tell Player '$[decrypt({P1},"fU6a|g")]'%;/echo %msg%;/test fwrite("tells", msg)
/def -ag -mregexp -t'^Player tells you \'crypt: (.*)\'' showtellfromplayer = /let msg=Player tells you '$[decrypt({P1},"playerkey")]'%;/echo -aB %msg%;/test fwrite("tells", msg)

So for ex. a:

Player tells you 'crypt: &1fAS&/5|¤'

is successfully echoed and logged

Except for the fact that the muds with snooping issues also have rules
against encryption and will punish you for using it...

If you don't like the idea of the powers/immortals snooping you on a game,
then go to a game where they don't snoop or have better control.

Most games have the option to snoop players and it is the implementor of
the game that decides how and when it will be used. Personally, I question
every use of snoop on my game. The powers know my rules and know that if
they snoop for fun or personal gain, then they will be punished.

Not the ones I play, this is relatively hard to set up anyway so normal
idiotic cheaters are filtered away, and intelligent cheaters don't talk
of such issues on the mud anyway. As it is now I won't talk about sensitive
or personal stuff on any mud, I do it on irc instead, with this, it wouldn't
be necessary.

A few suggestions:
1) Go to a mud that doesn't have such rampant snooping.
2) Don't discuss personal things on such muds.
3) Pre-agree on a caesar shift and use that in your communications, along
   with macros similar to what you posted.
  -> tell -=> tell <name> rot: [text rotated by N]
  <- tell rot: -=> [un-rotate text by N]
   Of course, a sufficiently paranoid/bored admin could try all 26
   shifts, or, as someone else pointed out, simply ban you.
4) Install and use (as in #3) pgp.

It would seem simpler to use icq, ytalk, any of a dozen other alternative

No it's not simpler, this would be a simple and beautiful solution.




<flame> grr

Seems like I just should've just presented this as a suggestion for 
new feature and skipped the explaination of the idea background. 

Or at least explained that the problem wasn't - "Help I'm being snooped and
I have no clue on how to avoid it!"

And yes I have a C-based system for en- and decrypting tells with tf, but
I wanted a generic way to do it so I can just tell someone a trigger,
mail him a password and start talking, without compilation or platform-
dependent problems.

...all of which have their own issues with privacy/security
(especially ICQ).

I think the idea is a good one.  Yes, there are other ways to deal with the
issue, but they might not work for everyone, and whatever happened to doing
something just cause it'd be a cool hack? ;)

Personally, my solution to this issue was to set up a chat mud on my own
server that my friends use to talk on while playing other muds.  This
worked great for us, but it won't work for everyone.

	This can (easily) done using tf's scripting language, as long as
you don't want some really impressive encryption. I can say this
because I have written such scripts in the past. Its even easy to
setup some simple auto decryption/encryption and password checking
without to much hassle. I'd also suggest this route since it can
keep Ken from having to worry about all those silly export
restrictions.

Hello:

For now I can whisper, or say a line. This (long)
line is wrapped. It would be convinient to have 
a way to whisper/say i.e. an address, that is not 
displayed as one big line, but

short line 1[lf]
short line 2[lf]

Is there any way to do this? In other words is there
an escape character to [lf], or to include \n
being a [lf]. Also how to display the contents of a 
file to a group/person?

Thanks,
Ton 't Lam

i don't think so ... i never saw such an esc char ... but .. you'll never
know :-)

i don't know what are you trying to do ... but ... is there a problem by
tiping the first line ENTER second ENTER ?
if it is .. you can try:
/send first %; /send second
of course ... the line must not contain % ... i guess ... 
i'm not sure ... try and .. i'm sure you will find exactly what you need

this is easy ... try /help quote

well ... /quote 'file
or ..... /quote !shell command ...  this is super :-)

for just in a world add -wworld .... bla bla bla

Most servers I know will strip out special characters in any lines you
send to it. After all, allowing such chacters would mean you can do some
interesting spoofs. Viz:

--input--
:throws a dagger at John.\nJohn gets hit in the chest and dies a horrible,
bloody death.
--output--
Fred throws a dagger at John.
John gets hit in the chest and dies a horrible, bloody death.
John heys! "No I don't. Stop @powergaming me, fred."

According to Wojciech Omilian:

> name and a password ?

Yes, I think so. Define a new world-type and use that world-type for your MUD.
Something like:

/def -T'mytype' -hLOGIN = /dobefore %; ${world_character} %; ${world_password}
/addworld -Tmytype TheMUD mud.mud.mud.org 1234

Should call your define "dobefore", before sending charater and password.
So make dobefore send whatever text you want.

I've been using TinyFugue (4.0 stable 1) for a couple weeks and have
been trying to get a trigger macro to work that would simplify my life
greatly. I can't, however, seem to make it do what I'd like.

I need the trigger to take the incoming text of 10 d100 rolls and total
them. If they do not total a given minimum, the macro should respond
appropriately to the mud. Here is what I have so far:

/def -p0 -mglob -t'Your rolls: {*} {*} {*} {*} {*} {*} {*} {*} {*} {*}'
\
    = /reroll
/def reroll = /let TOTL=$[%{3} + %{4} + %{5} + %{6} + %{7} + %{8} \
        + %{9} + %{10} + %{11} + %{12}]%; \
    /if ( {TOTL} < 550 ) \
        /echo %TOTL%; \
        /send roll%; \
    /else \
        /echo %TOTL%; \
    /endif

The incoming text from the mud is on one line and each roll is followed
by a comma then a space except the last one which has a period.

This macro was echoing a zero and rolling endlessly, regardless of the
total, so I used a simple test. I changed the macro to nothing more than
"/echo %{#}" to determine where the problem was, and this seems to be
it: this test echoes a zero to the screen instead of 12 (there are 12
words in the triggering text).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Dear Tom..
     You're close.. there's a few errors in your code..
     Here's a revision that should work..


I need the trigger to take the incoming text of 10 d100 rolls and total
them. If they do not total a given minimum, the macro should respond
appropriately to the mud. Here is what I have so far:

Notice what I do with the code:

/trig Your rolls:*=/
   /let TOTL=$[{3} + {4} + {5} + {6} + {7} + {8} \
        + {9} + {10} + {11} + trunc({12})]%; \
   /if ( {TOTL} < 550 ) \
        /echo %TOTL%; \
        /send roll%; \
  /else \
        /echo %TOTL%; \
  /endif


The incoming text from the mud is on one line and each roll is followed
by a comma then a space except the last one which has a period.


Try this one out.. I didn't try the full thing.. but I think I figgered out
yer errors..
 Have fun :)

You can have a trigger [name them!] that does the actual work
in its body. Note that we only have %P1 through %P9 (%P0 is everything
matched), so we pull in 1 through 8 normally, then regmatch the last 2.

/def -p0 -mregexp \
-t'^Your rolls: ([0-9]+), ([0-9]+), ([0-9]+), ([0-9]+), ([0-9]+), \
([0-9]+), ([0-9]+), ([0-9]+), (.+)$' reroll_trig = \
   /let one=%P1 %;\
   /let two=%P2 %;\
   /let three=%P3 %;\
   /let four=%P4 %;\
   /let five=%P5 %;\
   /let six=%P6 %;\
   /let seven=%P7 %;\

How about:

/def -t'* tells you: *' bot = %-3

Thus
Holly tells you: put keg in bag
results in:
/send put keg in bag

Adjust the "tells you:" for how your mud works.

/def -mregexp -t'(.*) tells you, \'(.*)\'' TFbot = \

This is a simple little robot bot. Checks for a valid Leader name before
executing any commands.  Can also use /eval rather then /send.

Change the capitaliztion to however our mud does it as well.

Read the manual page for caesar(6) on any system with the BSD games.
It automatically decrypts such rotations using frequency statistics.
I've used it frequently and in my experience has always chosen the
correct rotation.

Of course, for a suitably non-deterministic password, frequency stats
_shouldn't_ help, but it still remains a very poor choice.


And elsewhere in the thread were suggestions for ytalk, IRC & ICQ, all
of which are susceptible to snooping.  But then, so is your MUD/whatever
password.  :^(


As for export stuff - tinyfugue already has a pretty powerful command
language.  There are archives of tf scripts all over the world.  So to an
extent, that's not an issue.  If the all-singing all-dancing tf v5 could
have loadable module support, any encryption could be done as separate
modules distributed from outside the USA, without Ken's official consent
or knowledge.

Ken, could we have loadable module support in v5 please?  :^)

What I want to know is why this code causing a bunch of prompts to come
up is it sending enter key presses to the mud or something, from what I
understand echo shouldn't be effecting the mud at all.  Can someone
please tell me how I can fix this.

Take a look at pcmd.tf in the stdlib directory.  You want to set up the
appropriate triggers, then do a "WHO" (or whatever the command is).
The triggers should gag the output of the who list, extract the player's
name, then do your "tell" command on it.

In ansi_attr mode how do you make a trigger that will only catch
text based on its color say for green.  If the words "you're dead"
appear in green how can I make a trigger that will only catch that
if its in green, If it comes in any other color I dont want the trigger
to see if.

I asked this earlier and no one answered, so is this then not possible.
The mud I play on I need to be able to have a trigger activated when
a particular phrase comes out in green.  I use tinyfugue in ansi_attr
mode which works correctly for me under windows NT 4.0 SP4.

this one's pretty easy... just /send -W command. Not sure what you mean 
about snooping a world, though...

I'm solving the wrong problem here, but with emulation=debug you can use.

/def -p1 -mglob -t'^\[\[32mgreentext' tmp = /echo -aCgreen green

A way of accessing the nonprintable codes of a line would be interesting,
maybe in a way similar %{selector} works for positional parameters and
parenthesized regexp subexpressions. Let's say #{selector} is
the one for ansicodes, then a text:

<boldgreen>The exits are:<reset> <bold>u<reset>, <bold>d<reset>

/def -mregexp -t'^(The exits are:) ([a-z, ]+)' tmp = /echo #P1 and the other one is #P2 %; /echo -a#P1 %P1

would echo:

Cgreen,B and the other one is B
<boldgreen>The exits are:

The weakness is that if there are several codes in one %Pn there is no way of
knowing where the other one starts, but usually the knowledge of their
existence is more important than exact placement.


			Part 2.


 I wrote about this 1.5 years ago to this list, and now I try aging hoping
the times have changed.

The mud I play uses the 'flash' attribute (^[[?5h^[[?5l, try to echo that
in an xterm, like visual bell) quite a lot, but tf purges if showing
only a miserable '5h5l', would be neat if the screen really flashed, or
at least attempted to. As a funny detail, there is a windows mudclient that
crashes everytime that flash comes up. 

There is a way to make it flash now too, 
/def -t'*5h5l' tmp = /sh -q echo "^[[?5h^[[?5l"

But /sh -q doesn't do what it promises, it keeps very much noise and after
doing the echo it even shows two blank lines and % Resuming TinyFugue.
/sh -q could be made as quite as /sys is, and no echoing that flash
doesn't work with /sys.

I'd go for this too, but I'd suggest the @{attribute} format.

try the unadvertised /echo -r, or /set emulation=raw before you echo it,
and then set it back.

so basically I could do /def -mregexp -t'@{cgreen}here is some green text' =
trigger
then when ever "here is some green text" as long as the text came in as
green it would trigger if the text came in other colors it would not, this
correct ?

No, those were just suggestions for new features. Thanks for that echo -r, worked
very nicely even with emulation=ansi-attr. That -r switch might be worth documenting.

/def -p1 -mglob -t'*5h5l' flash = /echo -r ^[[?5h^[[?5l

Hm... The hardest part of this would be picking the random exit. You might 
try something like this:
/def try_random_exit = \
        /let exits=n w e s nw ne sw se%; \
        /send -w $(/nth $[rand(1,8)] %exits)

and then triggering to try again if you see the "can't go that way" 
message. You could possibly make it more intelligent by removing a choice 
after it's invalid until you actually move, but this will do for now.

here is something I wrote about 3/4 years ago. It should work, but you
may have to replace some %P1s with {P1}s etc. 

All you need is a trigger to match on 'alas' and call /norun 

hope thats some help.

Doing that then doing an /echo st causes
many prompts to appear, is there anyway I can avoid
doing this ? why does /test cause many prompts to appear ?

Ken Keys, I was wondering you would like to give us a preview of
TF 5.0, what will it contain, what new features will it have.  Etc
How much longer before it you expect to have it released ?

Also when you do release it do you know who will be porting it to
windows NT ?

Thanks

NObody answered, so maybe I'll explain it a bit. 
typing

/look_for 1 4 bracer 

will ostat those 4 bracers, but something is wrong with the end
of command. In other words, what to do ma enforce my ostat
$[i].%{_nr_3} to ostat:

ostat 1.bracer
ostat 2.bracer
ostat 3.bracer
ostat 4.bracer

Something with the point there is wrong, dunno what.

I've got a lil thing to do stuff multiple times:

;Nice little thing: "/d 10 say blah %c"  will result in:                        
;You say 'blah 1'                                                               
;You say 'blah 2'                                                               
;You say 'blah 3'... etcetc                                                     
/def d = /for c 1 %1 %-1

/d 4 ostat %c.bracer would do exactly what you want

Can change it to suit your needs.

Yap, thx.
but the same thing is produced by /for i 1 4 ostat $[i].bracer,
not much longer. Look above 1, 4 and bracer I want as kinda
variables to change 1 to 3, 4 for  20, bracer for ring or
whatever. That's what for I need a macro.

Some basics are of course clear, /dokey NEWLINE, all the things
with ESC (/bind ^[w = ...), but got problems wit some more
complicated keybindinngs. 

For example /bind ^S = say s suspended my tf (unix).
Have to Ctrl + C. Anybody know why ?

Further, there is an example after h bind

/bind ^Xtw = :jumps to the left; ...

Am I supposed to press all three keys (X, T and W)
simultaneously?

Where are all keybindigns that are already workin (coded in tf)
listed? I mean, sure /list -b lists only my bindings, where are
othere, U know, like ^C, ^[p or whatever. Could anybody gimme
kinda better explanation than after /help keybindings, /help bind
and /help dokey. Sorr, there are kinda lama queestions, but I
haven't used keybindings that much.

This isn't tinyfugue.  This is the terminal settings for your tty (login
line).  At a shell, before starting tinyfugue, type "stty -a" - this
will list all the current settings.

^S is stop - a kind of flow control.  To resume, type ^Q - assuming
that you're using default settings.

You can disable this with:
$ stty stop '^-' start '^-'
(where '$ ' is the shell prompt) before starting tinyfugue.  Note that
the ^- there are two characters, a caret then a minus, not
control-minus.

As I understand it, ^X, then t, then w.

^C is also a tty setting - it sends an interrupt signal (SIGINT) to the
tinyfugue process.  Tinyfugue catches this and then asks you what you
want to do.

The normal bindings are defined with '-i', to be invisible unless you
explicitly ask to see them.  Use:
/list -ib
and you'll see all the bindings, not just the visible ones.  Use '-I' to
see only the invisible ones.  Use:
/help list
to see more information on the /list command.

Hello, do I really have to compile tf before I can use it in win95? It
just seemed strange, it would be normal for unix but I've never seen a
program for win95 that you had to compile first.

does anyone have some code to help mapping areas?

not the tintin style mark/path but something to draw an ASCII map with rooms
like:

\|/ 
-O-  
/|\

i have seen such a mapper written in tcl and i don't want to port it (with a
two week of use of tinyfugue as a background) if there's already something
similar around :)

this mapper saves in a file a list of room titles, room exits,coordinates ..
so that is possible to load the description and regenerate the ASCII map [and
a few other tricks as finding coordinates of a certain room, or the title of
the room at coords, echoing only a portion of the map, ecc.]

You can either get the cygwin tools and compile it yourself, or there
are unofficial compiled versions at http://www.druware.com/tf/

I wrote something like this a while ago; if you're interested, send me
an email back, and I'll send it when I get home (it's on my home machine,
and not this account).

It doesn't do room titles or coordinates, just markers (a-z and 0-9) along
with exits.

eg:
    +--
    |
C---+


It _is_ old, but it worked for what I wanted :)

The basic process is:
/load the tf file
walk around, trying not to bump into walls
save the directions out
/quit
compile & run a 'c' program that reads the directions
and prints the ascii map.

Note that you need a c compiler and a few K of disk space.

Hi
Is there any way to increase the number of text lines tf displays? Right
now I'm only getting 24 lines of text with the bottom half of my screen
being left blank (I have 39 lines).
I'm using TinyFugue version 3.5 alpha 13.Built for SunOS 7 4.1.4 and CRT
v2.3.

Thanks,
Jimbob.

    What mapper have you seen in TCL? I'd love to check it out.. TCL
exists for quite a few platforms, so it doesn't seem like all that much
porting would be necessary...

Make sure to use 'resize' or whatever the SunOS equiv is so the unix
term knows how many lines and columns your display is set too, then
startup TF.

No, you could go to the TinyFugue homepage (tf.tcp.com/~hawkeye/tf/) and follow the link from there to the compiled Win32 executable.

The above is in reply to Kevin R. Jones's message, entitled "tf in win95" -

Hi,
I am new to TF, but I think I love it already!  I have a problem though,
my mud likes to send a prompt with other text on the same line.  It is
SlothMUD 3 which is a modified diku mud.  I use the /addworld -Tdiku,
and the autologin works fine, it just doesn't take care of the prompt.
I have been reading the documentation, but all I find is that if I
specify a diku mud, this prompt problem should be fixed (but it isn't).
I used Zmud for the longest time and was able to get around the problem
by triggering on the prompt and then echoing a %cr (newline).

Here is a sample prompt:

<205hp 83ma 101mv>The seedy-looking sailor has arrived.

I normally wouldn't care, but it makes for writing two sets of triggers
ones to match the prompt + text and ones that match ^text.  ARGGGGH!!!
I hope I haven't confused anyone now.

Thanks for any help,

Josh Owens

Try this:

/def -p10000000 -mregexp -t'^<[^>]*>' fix_joined_prompt = \
    /test prompt({P0}), substitute({PR})

The regexp matches the joined line; prompt() sets the prompt; and
substitute() resets the line to be only the stuff after the prompt,
so triggers (of lower priority) can match it, and it will be displayed
correctly.

There's a /snoop command (and many other tintin-like commands) in tintin.tf.

by the way, is there anything like substitute for hooks?
I'd love to substitute the send string before passing it to other send
hooks.

I'm having a problem with a telnet server that, if I'm interpreting
things right, insists on char-mode instead of line-mode and refuses to
let tf do the echoing.

I'm looking for a way to either put tf into char-mode for that server,
or (preferably) enforce local echo and throw away the echo sent of the
entire line after it got transmitted.
I'd rather prefer the latter, since I'd love to have line-editing, history,
etc here!

So far I've been unsuccessful and I hate typing in the dark :)

TIA, Tatjana

Hello, I installed tf on my pc last night, and I also use pc pine for
windows. After installing tf now pine wants to save all of it's stuff in
\home\mail a subdir of the tf dir. I did figure out a way around it, as
then pine got confused because it couldn't make the dir, but just wondered
if anyone else had seen this with pine specifically and/or any other email
program.

Thank you for the answer so quickly!  It works!  The only problem is that I
use the color settings from my mud, i.e. all gossips are a light green.  When
anything shows up after the prompt, the prompt is takin out like it should be
but it puts the text back as white.  I hope this is fixable to.

Thanks again,

Josh Owens

Version 5.0 (not released) will preserve the display attributes, but there's
nothing you can do about it in 4.0, short of making your own triggers that
re-color the text.

Not exactly.  But if you define your SEND hook with -q, it will prevent
the send of the original; and if your SEND hook sends new text, that new
text will go through all the SEND hooks.  But remember, the new text starts
over at the top of the SEND hook list, so if it matches the same hook again,
it will recurse.

Why did you use P0 and PR,  and also how do I trigger things off the
substituted text. i.e.
<209hp 75ma 101mv>You are hungry.

is now
You are hungry.
I have a regexp setup to match it, and it works fine except when it is the sub
text.  Here is my /def:

/def -p0 -mregexp -t'^You are hungry.' = get ration sack %; eat ration

I made some code to list some information the longer the list
gets the more prompts get displated at the end of the list from the mud.

I am not sending anything to the mud, but it slows down the list when I
want to display it frequently.  I'll get something like this
/3
==============
bunch of info
....
==============
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The only way to generate a bunch of prompts on the mud I play on is to
hit enter key many times.  So I need to know if /echo
$[functioncall(arg...)]
is sending something to the mud or not, and if it is sending an enter
key
how do I disable it, this is highly anoying.

Hello world :)

I unsuccessfully tried to create a macro (resp. a NOMACRO hook) 
to shortcut "/repeat -S ... /eval ...". I just wanted to be able
to type "/9 n", for example. Well, as I said, it didn't work -
maybe because (while evaluating the -hNOMACRO define) I couldn't 
get the no-macros arguments (e.g. "n"). 

Any ideas?

Adrian

PS: Oh, sure, I want to have "/9 ..." because I'm used to
    that - "# 5 ..." works just fine. :o)

Hello again,

It seems that I am having more trouble, and I think it has to do with my
lack of _TOTAL_ understanding of Regexp.  When I start a fight on
SlothMud it says:

A kobold youth hates your Guts!
A kobold hates your Guts!
A kobold hates your Guts!
A female kobold hates your Guts!
A kobold guard hates your Guts!
A kobold guard hates your Guts!
The kobold chieftain hates your Guts!
An artisan hates your Guts!
The silver-clad dragon god hates your Guts!
Elena hates your Guts!

or any number of mobs.  I would like to trap the word right before hate
into the variable target.  Here is my regexp and trigger setup:

/def -p0 -mregexp -t'([A|An|The])?([A-Za-z]+)?([A-Za-z]+) hates your
Guts!$' set_tar = /set target=%3

but I have problems, I guess, with the %3 because when I do a kobold or
rat or something with just one word, target=hates...  I would appreciate
if you can provide some help with as much documentation as possible

Thanks,
Josh Owens

Try this:

-t'^((A|An|The) )?(.+) hates your Guts!$'

(refer to /help regexp..)
The ^ forces a start-of-line match.
[] patterns are different from ( | ) patterns - one matches only one character,
and the latter matches phrases.  (You forgot to include spaces in the pattern,
so I inserted one inside the optional "a/an/the" parentheses.
Since the attacker could be over one word, and conceivably contain any type of
character, I used .+ to match 1 or more of any type of character.  To
exclude punctuation, you could use [a-zA-Z ]+ instead.
And, the attacker pattern is enclosed in parenetheses so it can be pulled out
by the trigger body - use %P3.  (see /help %1)

Dear Kevin..
  I have had the same sort of problem myself.. the reason this happens is
because when you load in tf for windows, and start it up, it
re-establishes the variable HOME to mean the tf-home-directory.
Unfortunately this means that any program that was using a previous
definition for the variable HOME (i.e. a different directory) will now
start assuming HOME refers to this new specification.  Since pine is
traditionally unix based, as is tf, they both are probably setting their
own version of the HOME variable, and the one that gets set last is, of
course, the one that both programs used.
  Personally I don't know how to go into any of the tf stuff or pine stuff
to reset either program so they use some variable besides HOME.  I somehow
doubt it's doable on the windows level without the source code.  According
to the tf-docs, you do need to have HOME set to where tf sets it in order
for tf to run correctly.  Good luck on trying to figger out how to make
them separate directories.

Hello again,

I was wondering how I save global variables to a file, that way I can
track things in between sessions.

Thanks,
Josh Owens

Possibly workaround (easy fix)

Create a batch file, with 

set HOME=<insert-directory-here>
pine or tf or whatever executable you want to launch here

and call the batch file instead of the executable.
First starting pine and then tf won't change the environment settings of
the pine session.

I'd be very interested in seeing this as well... have either of you made

Hello!
I posted this some weeks ago and haven't got an answer, so i decided to
try again. Please take a few moments and if it's unclear, just say so and
i'll explain. 

"I want to do something like that:

1) Log an entire mud session into the file today.log
2) Replay the file today.log through tf.

Okay, so i can easily perform step 1.
I have no idea how to do step 2.

You know, i want to be able to replay a mud session into tf, so that all
my triggers etc do what they have to do and i could this way feel the same
way and see the same things, in the exact order that they happend when
they were logged. I perused the tf help but couldn't find anything like
that...

Do i have to dig deeper into the helps? 
Or, isn't this kind of thing even implemented?
If it's not, does any of you out there find it interesting?
Maybe it could get added in future versions?
If yes, i already have an idea of improvement (which is actually a thing i
would _very_ much like to use): the possibility to record time stamps or
such, which could reproduce the logged mud session _exactly_ as it was
played, i.e. with lag and such kind of things. It could be nice to "live"
an entire mud session again, at any time, provided it was logged properly.

This would possibly result in a new option for /log(e.g. -t standing for
time), and a new command: /replay :)

Is it too much, and again, does any of you think this could be an
interesting addition to this piece-of-art that's tf?"

Thank you.

That would require capturing the incoming information from the MUD,
capturing the commands, timestamps on both, then feeding them in.
Whilst it may be just about possible, I doubt that it's a worthwhile
approach.

You can fiddle it a bit at present, provided you don't mind not being in
tinyfugue for the replay.  "/log -t" would be good, but provided you
don't want colour the following should work:
 * Increase %{histsize} to something large enough to handle _everything_
   from the MUD session.
 * At the end, after disconnecting, do:
    /log filename
    /recall -t%@: -q -wTheWorldName 1-
    /log off
 * To replay, run a script (shell, perl, whatever) over the log file
   which subtracts the time given in the stamp for the current line from
   that of the previous line, pauses for that length of time, then
   output's the line (without timestamp).

The "-t%@:" will use a timestamp format consisting of the system time in
seconds since Jan 1st 1970 (on Unix at least - it's documented in /help
ftime as "raw system time (nonstandard TF extension)") followed by a
colon, then the obligatory space.  So you get, eg, the two lines:
924344470:  You emote 'Comet huggles' to Erin.
924344491: > Queen Erin huggles rb
^^^^^^^^^^^
 timestamp

So display the first, then pause 21 seconds, then the next.  Perl is
probably going to be the most sensible option for this (no advocacy wars
please!)

It might be possible to get colours too, with tfio streams instead of /log
- I can't remember where the colour gets stripped and what might be
possible.  Sorry.

Hope this helps.

This code seems to take away spaces which is bad I need this to
not alter what is typed in anyway at all.
example if I type "                look" it will truncate it to "look"
before
it gets sent, how do I fix this, seems the more complicated coding
I do the more the limitations of TF start to show.

The spaces are lost by the {*}.  The {Pn} variables will not lose spaces,
so you can use a regexp like this:

/def -ag -mregexp -F -h'SEND ^.*$' chat_send = /test send (strcat({P0}))

   Greetings, all.

   Quick trigger question.  I'm using TF 4.0, and I'd like to have both
line-wrapping and triggers based on ANSI codes.  If I use raw emulation, I
can trigger successfully off of ANSI codes sent from my MUD, but I lose
linewrap.  ansi_attr emulation lets me keep linewrapping, but converts
ANSI to TF's format, so my triggers miss it.

   Any way I can get both working?

Oh, didn't know ansi_attr emulation can cause such a troubles.
Got that and noticed, ( posted somethinsg about that before )  
that sometimes my triggers and hilites aren't caught what is
ftustrating coz sometimes some important things are based on
them. So if it's the problem like above I'm also interested in
the answer.

This is directed primarily at Ken but the rest of you may have an interest.

As the Cygwin project has gone forward it has gonne increasingly tied to it's own shell (bash) for doing 
many of it's console features.  This has made maintaining the Win32 port increasingly difficult.  At one 
point in time you had mentioned that you might be reworking the I/O model a little for TF 5 and I thought I 
would ask before I went and gutted the model it uses now to work with a native I/O model that would 
eliminate the need for the CygWin stuff (select()) and also gain full BeOS compatability.

Unfortunately, I haven't got huge amounts of time to devote to this, but I do want to get it done (if for 
no other reason than I can't use CygWin on my Alpha NT).  If you do intend on changing the model, I'll hold 
off on that portion of the coding until you have something that I can work with, otherwise I'll continue 
hacking on 4.0.

Thanks in advance,
Andy

Someone mentioned a hack for terminfo some time ago, to get colours while
running tf in a screen session. Since I'm clueless about terminfo, can
anyone explain me how exactly I can get colours while running tf in
screen?

Also, (lil off-topic *toe*) someone posted a procmail recipe some while
ago to get rid of the [TF] thing people were using in the subject field. I
need to do something similar, can anyone fill me in?

Thanks,

There is an ansi-version of screen 3.7.4 called screen-3.7.4+ansi.tar.gz.

I can't quite remember where I got it; it's not one of the official
releases of screen, but it should be out there somewhere. (Try using
altavista or ftpsearch.) 

If you can't find it anywhere, mail me privately and I'll try to mail you
the package. 

It does work well, and it's quite nice for other applications like lynx or
ircii-EPiC, or just simply to get colours in ls. 

Henrik.

Stick the following in your .screenrc:
----- start -----
#More Xterm Color Hacks
 termcap  vt100 'AF=\E[3%dm:AB=\E[4%dm'
 terminfo vt100 'AF=\E[3%p1%dm:AB=\E[4%p1%dm'
 termcap  vs100 AF=\E[3%dm
 terminfo vs100 AF=\E[3%p1%dm
 termcap  vs100 AB=\E[4%dm
 terminfo vs100 AB=\E[4%p1%dm
----- end -----

I don't know who originally posted this, but it works like a charm.

There is a GNOME frontend available named Crescendo.
You can find it at http://crescendo.edenproject.org
There is a good bit of support for it and it is being
actively developed.

YEs it's official, tf-40s1 for Win32 is available (finally).  I would like to run this one as a limited 
test of the new installer and get some feedback before I put it on the webpage though.

The problem is this, I've moved from the CygWin B19 tools to the B20.1 tools.  The good news, running TF 
from BASH provides working /sh! and /quote support (within limits) however it's got some other quirks.

I would suggest installing the current user tools from sourceware.cygnus.com before using this version.  IT 
does still work outside the confines of BASH, and that's where I use it the most.

Also in this release is an added function called /winexec.  This will allow you to exec and command line 
that windows supports, including hooking into the windows scripting host (cscript or wscript).  

IF you are interested please contact me directly and I will see about getting this out to you in the next 
day or so

Andy

Or maybe you want
/def gossip = /quote gossip !echo "%*" | /usr/games/rot13

then
/gossip stuff here
which will then send
gossip fghss urer

Ahhh, ok, let me try again:

	/def rot13 = /quote -decho !echo %{*} | /usr/bin/rot13
	/def gr = /quote /rot13 `/recall 2 gossip


Then typing "/gr" will show you the last 2 lines received through gossip
(rot13 encoded). This is close enough?

Well, actually none of the answers were correct :) Normal screen 3.7.2
displays colors without a flaw. You don't need the +ansi version.

The screen displays colors if the term it is running on has color support
- and it determines it by looking at the termcap entry. So, if you pick
some term like vt220 or linux (console), it has color support and screen
shows colors.

The problem people are having is that the normal 'xterm' termcap or
terminfo doesn't advertise color support - the name of the xterm with
colors varies in different termcaps/infos. For example, debian linux
distribution has xterm-debian as the xterm with colors, RMS:s common
terminfo distribution has xterm-xfree86 as the term which has colors.
These shouldn't be mixed up with 'color-xterm' or 'xterm-color' or any of
the crappy xterm variants that exist.

The obvious solution is ofcourse that you bug your administrator into
putting a _correct_ xterm entry in the termcap/info. Or, if you are the
administrator yourself, go get xterm-93 package from somewhere which
normally comes with xfree86 (xc/programs/xterm), and configure it and say
make install-ti to install a good termcap entry which works fine.

Now, the solution offered here, something like this:
termcap  xterm 'AF=\E[3%dm:AB=\E[4%dm'
terminfo xterm 'AF=\E[3%p1%dm:AB=\E[4%p1%dm'
forcefully inserts color describing entries to the termcap/info database.

This is ofcourse fine, but I would still recommend bugging your admins to
fix things properly as this affects programs run outside screen (all
ncurses software for example).

Fortunately, a lot of people sent me email to my personal address too :)

Jeremy Blosser sent me some stuff to put in my .screenrc that indeed works
like a charm :) Problem is indeed Debian's termcap database, and how they
use it, they've got different settings for xterm, xterm_debian,
xterm_xfree86 and it bugs the hell outta me. Outside screen, everything
works fine tho :) I'll go check that xterm-93 packages out, thanks.

Jeff and Phil Pennock both sent me a procmail recipe which I could use to
make something that satisfies my needs. Of course, I first forgot to pipe
the body of the message as well, so the headers were going into a seperate
folder, and the bodies in /var/spool/mail/duckie heheh :) Well, I'm
learning :) (It's working spiffy now)


Thanks again,
--Duckie

I know I'm close :)

I wrote this:
/def -w -mregexp -t'You have become AFK.$' autoafk =\
  /repeat -180 1 \
    /if (idle() >= 60) \
      /send -w afk %%; \
    /endif
and it works fine... so I thought I would write something similar:
/set autohuntvar=0
/def -w'sam' -m'regexp' -t'^([A-Za-z ]+) is (up|down) from here.$" autohunt =\
  /if ({autohuntvar} == 1) \
    /send -w %P2 %%; \
    /send -w hunt %P1 %%; \
  /endif
/def -w'sam' autohunt = \
  /toggle autohuntvar

the /set and /def work great...
but, with mecho set to on, I see that:
+ TRIGGER: /autogoandhunt
++ /IF
++ ({autohuntvar} == 1)
% autogoandhunt: macro syntax error: expected /endif, found end of body.
++ /THEN

So, I tried:
  /if (autohuntvar) \
  /if (%autohuntvar) \
  /if ({autohuntvar}) \
  /if (autohuntvar == 1) \
  /if (%autohuntvar == 1) \
all with similar results... if you could point me to my error, I would
appreciate it.

Doesn't seem to be the case here, but things like this happen also if
there are spaces (or other things, spaces are sometimes hard to see heheh)
behind the trailing '\'. I've asked this before, no one could tell me why
tinyfugue has to be so durn sensitive about that. Imho it'd be best if it
just didn't read or parse the rest of the line.

I would like to know if there is any way of making it so that /repeat will
repeat a given task with random intervals instead of constant intervals.
The command does not support this by default, and I was wondering if there
was an easy way of getting around this. Thanks in advance!

Here's something I use that may be of use here:

/def random_do_something = \
  /set next=$[rand(1,30)] %;\
  /send -wyour_world_name_here action_to_do %;\
  /repeat -0:%next 1 /random_do_something

YMMV

The backslash doesnt strictly signify the end of the line.  What it means
is that the next character is a literal character.  So if there's a space
after the backslash, instead of signifying a literal newline, its
signifying a literal space.  You can also use the backslash to escape
other characters, such as a regular forward slash.

Thanks for clearing that up Kyle. 
I had always wondered about it.

Another question I have:

When you def inside a def you need to replace %; with %%; and 
(in the past) %P1 with %%P1, for the duration of the nested def.

My triggers that do that still work (I can include them at another,
time) but I get the 'may cause confusion try {P1} instead' warning.

If I replace the %%P1 with {P1) it refers (I think to the scope) of 
the parent trigger. So what do I do? I dont think {%P1} would 
eliminate the error?

Any suggestions? 

Please just ask me to clarify in personal mail if this is not clear.

Thanks list :)

Mysty

Looks like it's time to post histories.tf again.  It should be
self-explanatory - use /save_history -w<world> for just one world,
or /save_histories to save them all in one shot.  Sub-directories will
be created in whatever directory is "current" for tf (either the dir you
started up in, or whereever you went with the last /lcd command).

(some lines are commented out - they are intended to be (many are
previous attempts at optimal code left in for reminders - except the
hook at the bottom, which you need for save_histories to work.)

   Anyone out there think of any way I could get both linewrapping and the
ability to trigger off of ANSI codes?  :)  Raw emulation gives me ANSI
triggers, ansi_attr emulation gets linewrapping, and ne'er the twain shall
meet, it seems.  Suggestions?  :)

Hello,

I am trying to make a set of triggers that count the amount of backstabs
that I hit, miss, or splork...  It all seem to be going well, that is,
until I went to do the percent stuff.  It seems when I divide 1/3, I get
0%, even when I multiply by 100 before I divide (that is how I got
around zMUD not using decimals).  I would really like to get this part
working!  I will include the triggers and macros:

;This is all for the stab counter below:

/def -p0 -mregexp -t'makes a strange sound, as you place .* back' = \
 /test {num_stabs} + 1%; \
 /set num_stabs=%?%; \
 /test {num_hits} + 1%; \
 /set num_hits=%?%; \
 /stab_math


/def -p0 -mregexp -t'quickly avoids your backstab, and you nearly cut
your finger' = \
 /test {num_stabs} + 1%; \
 /set num_stabs=%?%; \
 /test {num_misses} + 1%; \
 /set num_misses=%?%; \
 /stab_math


/def -p0 -mregexp -t'a strange sound but is suddenly very silent, .*
back' = \
 /test {num_stabs} + 1%; \
 /set num_stabs=%?%; \
 /test {num_splork} + 1%; \
 /set num_splork=%?%; \
 /stab_math

;It appears that when you have nothing of somethin (i.e. no misses) you
get a divison by zero error, Im fixing it --JO

/def stab_math = \
 /test {num_stabs} * 100%; \
 /set per_stabs=%?%; \
 /test {num_splork} / {per_stabs}%; \
 /set per_splork=%?%; \
 /test {num_misses} / {per_stabs}%; \
 /set per_misses=%?%; \
 /test {num_hits} / {per_stabs}%; \
 /set per_hits=%?

Also, does anyone have text highlight for .tf files using emacs or
Xemacs? (I dont think emacs does text highlighting, just Xemacs).  If
so, please send me the info on it!

Assume the following variables a and b:

/set a 1
/set b 3

/eval /echo $[{a}/{b}]
0

/eval /echo $[1.0/3]
0.333333333333333

/eval /echo $[1/3.0]
0.333333333333333

/eval /echo $[(1.0*{a})/{b}]
0.333333333333333

/eval /echo $[{a}/({b}*1.0)]
0.333333333333333

So try multiplying one of the variables with 1.0 before the division.
Ciao,

Hi,

I dont know if anyone caught my earlier post about xemacs coloring, as I
mixed it in with an earlier question.  I was wondering if anyone had
written a color support file for Xemacs, lick the c++ color coding that
it has.  I would like to have my .tf files show up in color, i.e.
comments in green, keywords in blue...(visual studio style(double
yuck!))

Thanks,
Josh Owens

I haven't heard of an xemacs TF config file, but since Mr. Tinyfugue,
Ken Keys, is a vim user, there is a syntax/tf.vim available.  (The one
in the current 5.3 distribution works, but is not very comprehensive -
Ken did a newer one recently, but as far as I know has not posted it yet.
Maybe he will now.)

Hi,
as i wrote a lisp-function that finds trailing spaces and not \ ended
lines which are probably wrong, I would contribute this to a tf.el package
If none of you wants to write such a package I will (given the time ;)

Hi list!!

How can I update ${world_name} so that it changes the text on the line
seperating the input from output area?

I want for example to use it as a variable to store names of people
who mailed me while I may have slipped away from the keyboard.

Rather than tinkering with the value of {world_name}, I suggest changing
the format of your status line, so that you can include that information.

Take a look at /help status to get started... It's rather complicated, so
feel free to holler again with questions.

(e.g. write a trigger to store the data you want to display, into a global
variable.. then display this variable in your status line.)

I suppose that the main thing you want is having world local variables.

just use the following functions for that
/def setw = /set ${world_name}_%1=%-1%;
/def getw = /return ${world_name}_%1%;

usage:
/setw varname value
/getw varname

/setw mail mysterion, mesirii
/getw mail
->mysterion, mesirii 
if ${world_name} is "mud" the variable created is "mud_mail"

perhaps other useful functions are:
/unsetw = /unset ${world_name}_%1%;
/listw = /listvar "${world_name}*" 
/echow = /result ${world_name}_%1%;

have fun
Mesi

Ive been going through /help status with no success to speak of.

Does anyone have a simple example of a macro that will put a
variable's value onto the status line? I think I can get it to update
itself when it changes, but I can't get it up on the line.

Thanks list

Mysty

I use a slightly munged version of TF (to allow the attributes of
the status bar entries to be held in a variable), but the following is
a snippet from one of my setup files:

/set ats_body=10
/set ats_endurance=26
/set ats_stun=26
/set ats_body_hi=Ccyan
/set ats_endurance_hi=Ccyan
/set ats_stun_hi=Ccyan
/set ats_eta=00:00
/set ats_turn=O
/set ats_turn_hi=BCcyan
/set WOList=E
/set ATS_Console_Pwd=bluebeard

/set ATS_Status_Bar=@more:8:Br "_H2H(":5 ats_turn:1:%ats_turn_hi ":":1 ats_body:
2:%ats_body_hi ":":1 ats_endurance:2:%ats_endurance_hi ":":1 ats_stun:2:%ats_stu
n_hi ")_ETA(":6 ats_eta:5:Ccyan ")":2 @active:11 :1 @world :1 @clock:5

/set status_var_ats_body=substr(strcat(" ",abs({ats_body})),-2)
/set status_var_ats_stun=substr(strcat(" ",abs({ats_stun})),-2)
/set status_var_ats_endurance=substr(strcat(" ",abs({ats_endurance})),-2)

/def -i -wMFrl -mregexp -t"^([0-9]+) Stun taken." ATS_Stun= \
        /IF (({P1} >= {ats_stun}) & ({ats_stun} > 0)) \
                /set ats_stun_hi=BCred %; \
        /ENDIF %; \
        /set ats_stun=$[{ats_stun} - {P1}]


I hope that helps you out.

(The status patch I use is in the RPM on pc24.sr.bham.ac.uk in
/pub/packages/*)

My status line is slightly different from the original one. First you tell
tf what fields to stuff in the status line:

/set status_fields=@world :1 statusPosition:7 statusAfk:5 statusTells:3
@log:5 :1 @mail:6 @clock:16


Then i set the appropriate variables, for example:

/set status_int_clock ftime("%c", time())

/def -i -mregexp -t"^(You wake and stand up.|You stand up.|You are already
standing.)" stand= /set statusPosition (stand)

/def -i -mregexp -t"^(You lay down on the floor and fall asleep.|You are
already sleeping.|You lay down on some blankets and fall asleep.)" sleep=\
        /set statusPosition (sleep)

/def -i -mregexp -t"^You sit down on the floor to rest a while." rest=\
        /set statusPosition (rest)


Hope this helps,

One mans "simple" is another mans "horribly incomprehensible code", it
seems! :)

The status bar is/was the most annoying part of tf to figure out I think.
I still haven't decided it's because the implementation is needlessly
complex, if the help file is bad or if it's just a matter of needing to
have a programmers mindset to get it. I just gave up and left the
plain old clock there and built in echoing of lots of info from my
triggers to the screen instead, eventually.

I guess I've figured out more or less how to alter it now though, but
I'm not really sure it's worth the aggravation to go back over my
triggers to alter them to start using it...

Mvh,
	Kimmo.

Lemme try and explain the status line. 

First you set the status_field variable, which consists of a number of
variable names, widths and an attributes. Just forget about the attribute
for a while.

Examples:

/set var=
/set status_fields=var:5
This gives a status line with 5 characters reserved for the contents of a
variable named 'var' The "/set var=" is necessary because the field name
must be declared before the status_field variable.

/set var=blah
The status line now displays blah_________ ...

/set var=blahblah
The status line now displays blahb____ ... because we only reserved 5
characters for the variable.

Now let's take a look at the original status line:
/set status_fields=@more:8:Br :1 @world :1 @read:6 :1 @active:11 :1
@log:5 :1 @mail:6 :1 insert:6 :1 @clock:5

The variables with a @ are special variables and described in the help
file. They use special format variables like status_int_more. Nothing to
be worried about if you want to stuff your own variables in it, just set a
variable and put its name literally in the status_fiels variable.

The " :1 " are fields without a variable, and they simply eat up 1
character of the status line, causing an empty space on it.

One example of an attribute is the "Br" behind the @more variable. It
causes the "More: 35" thing to be displayed bold and reversed. So if we'd
wanna display "blah" in bold and reverse, our line would be:

/set var=blah
/set status_fields=var:5:Br

For a list of all attributes, see /help attribute.

I don't know what the hassle in the help file about redrawing the status
line means, my status line changes at the same moment as a variable
changes. 

Cheers,
--Duckie

Hello,

is there a way to replace the @log and insert variables with some shorter
display text?
I dont want to waste the room with (Log) or (Over) when one single letter
would be enough to say (like L for log or O for overwriting).

Any idea where I could replace those texts ?

Harry

I have done just that, here's a summary of what I've done:

/set status_int_log nlog() ? "L" : "l"
/set status_var_insert test({insert} =~ "off") ? "O" : "o"

Then my status_fields contains these items, among others:

        @log:1:BCcyan insert:1:BCcyan

That way, I see 'l' if logging is off, and 'L' if it's on, and 'o'/'O' for
insert/overstrike.

BTW, I've found that I need to define all the associated variables before
I set my status_fields variable.

Hi,

I have a little trouble handling backslash in strings.
I've got a variable with a text which has backslashes in it:
{Msg} is something like "text.. \"
                                ~~
The backslash on the end shadows the '"'. So when trying to do something
like:
/test echo("@{CRed}%{Msg}","",1)
I get:
% test: expression syntax error: expected ',' or ')' after function
argument, found '"'.
Probably means that it can't see the '"' 'cos it's '\"'
How can I fix that?
I tried replace() , but replace("\\","\\\\",{Msg}) doesn't work.
Did I miss something?

Thanks in advance.
Demon.

You might want to try /escape instead.  It's designed explicitly for
escaping metacharacters.

Yap, there was an example how to make your own mudtype. 
Let's assume I have to send to thw world always some lines before
name and password and some after.
I tried something like above:


/def -T'mymudtype' -hLOGIN = blah1 %; blah2 %; blah3 %; my_name %; my_password %; blah4 %; blah5
/addworld -T'mymudtype' MyMUD mymud.mymud 2345

and it doesn't work at all. How to organize sending text before
and after name and password. 
Anybody?

It's automatically stored, try Ctrl+B and last command will be
shown.

Thant's ok but how put it in tany variable for example?


i found the pattern ^string1^string2^ but have no idea what to put under
string1 and string2 to repeat last command ( if this will ever work)

First off, thanks to "Duckie" for the very clear description with examples
of how the status line works, much easier to grasp the basic concepts with
simple examples, I find.

I do however have a question that I'm not sure I can figure out by
RTFM:ing, but I'll ask it anyway - is there any way to change the
attributes in the status line "on the fly" as the variable changes, or
do I have to alter the entire status line with a new /set status_fields
statement?

For instance, I have a variable that tells me whether or not I have some
automatic actions engaged or not - ideally, that variable would switch
to red when active and green when not. Can you do that some simple way
or is it a new /set status_fields that is your only option?

Regards,
	Kimmo.

  I had the same problem and spent hours trying to get it the work the way
I wanted it to.. Finally I came to the conclusion that the only way was to
reset the status_fields variable each time..

  To simplify it all I defined a macro that just resets the status fields..
Here is pieces of my scripts to do it all..

--- Begin example
; First set the variables so they exist..
/set my_hp=?
/set my_hp_max=?
/set my_gp=?
/set my_gp_max=?

; Set the colors to white until we know what they should be and so that
; they also exist when we try using them..
/set my_hp_color=white
/set my_gp_color=white

; This is one of the ways the info can come.. current(max)
; "Hp: 1911(1911)  Gp: 225(225)  Xp: 4415"

/def -F -i -mregexp -t"^Hp: ([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)  Gp: ([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)  Xp: ([0-9]+)" loc_trig_sb = \
	/set my_hp=%P1 %; \
	/set my_hp_max=%P2 %; \
	/set my_gp=%P3 %; \
	/set my_gp_max=%P4 %; \
	/set my_xp=%P5 %; \
	/do_status_colors


; Or like this..
; Hp: 1545 Gp: 209

/def -F -i -mregexp -t"^Hp: ([0-9]+) Gp: ([0-9]+)" loc_trig_hpinfight = \
	/set my_hp=%P1 %; \
	/set my_gp=%P2 %; \
	/do_status_colors

; This macro is called in every trigger that changes the values..

/def -i do_status_colors = \
	/if ( my_hp > (my_hp_max / 2) ) \
		/set my_hp_color=green %; \
	/elseif ( my_hp < (my_hp_max / 4) ) \
		/set my_hp_color=red %; \
	/else %; \
		/set my_hp_color=yellow %; \
	/endif %; \
	/if ( my_gp > (my_gp_max / 2) ) \
		/set my_gp_color=green %; \
	/elseif ( my_gp < (my_gp_max / 4) ) \
		/set my_gp_color=red %; \
	/else %; \
		/set my_gp_color=yellow %; \
	/endif %; \
	/set_status_bar


; All this macro does is updating the status_field variable..
; Notice how I use variable substitution in the color fields..
/def -i set_status_bar = \
	/set status_fields=%{me} :2 "Hp:" my_hp:4:C%{my_hp_color} "(" my_hp_max:4 \
	")" :2 "Gp:" my_gp:3:C%{my_gp_color} "(" my_gp_max:3 ")" :2 "Xp:" my_xp:6 :2 \
	"a:" my_attitude:1 :1 "r:" my_response:1 :2 @log:5 :1 insert :1 dtime:7 :1 \
	@clock:5

; Now set the status field initially..

/set_status_bar

--- End example

  This is really the only way of solving the problem as far as I know anyway..
If anyone know any other way, I would be happy to find out.. If you feel that the
example is too complicated, please feel free to ask more questions about it..

Look at /help HOOK, the LOGIN hook uses the char name and password defined
in your world definition. So you do need to use ${world_character} and
${world_password} and set then in the /addworld definition. Or just use a
CONNECT hook.

Hi,

I've been trying to hack the /tickon code so that instead of only
performing a single action, I can get it to flip-flop between commands
at each tick...

At first, I simply put an /IF /ELSE /ENDIF statement within the /repeat
thing that is already there - but I couldn't get that to work...

(something like: (I didn't make notes - so this is from memory)
...
/repeat -%ticksize 1 \
	/IF (_tick_act == 1) \
		do_something %; \
		do_something else %; \
		/set _tick_act=2 %;\
	/ELSE \
		do_something %; \
		do_something else %; \
		/set _tick_act=1 %;\
	/ENDIF %; \	
...
)

Then, I tried having the /IF /ELSE /ENDIF with the /REPEAT bit within
the loop...

(Again, something like:
...
/IF (_tick_act ==1) \
	/repeat -%ticksize 1 \
		do_something %; \
		do_something else %; \
		/set _tick_act=2 %;\
/ELSE
	/repeat -%ticksize 1 \
		do_something %; \
		do_something else %; \
		/set _tick_act=1 %;\
/ENDIF %; \
...
)

This resulted in the do_something happening at the time it was supposed
to - but the other stuff getting run straight away - which made it
recurse away into infinity (well, actually, it just complained a lot)

Finally - I got this to work: - but it's not ideal - 'cause I can't stop
it anymore (I had to take all the pid stuff out to get it to work)

/def -i tickon = \
        /tickoff%;\
        /@test next_tick := $(/time @) + ticksize %;\
        /IF (_tick_act == 1) \
                /set _tick_act=2 %; \
                /repeat -%ticksize 1 \
                        /tick_action %; \
                /repeat -%ticksize 1 \
                        /tickon %; \
        /ELSE \
                /set _tick_act=1 %; \
                /repeat -%ticksize 1 \
                        /tick_action_2 %; \
                /repeat -%ticksize 1 \
                        /tickon %; \
        /ENDIF %; \

Can anyone offer me some advice as how I might be able to code this a
little better? (I don't have the original tf tick code to hand) - is
there a simple way of giving a /repeat command a lot of things to do,
rather than just a single command?

Thanks.

Steve.

You want the code inside that /repeat to execute when the timer expires,
not now, so you need to escape the %; -

/repeat -%ticksize 1 \
      /IF (_tick_act == 1) \
              do_something %%; \
              do_something else %%; \
              /set _tick_act=2 %%;\
      /ELSE \
              do_something %%; \
              do_something else %%; \
              /set _tick_act=1 %%;\
      /ENDIF %; \

If you make reference to any variables that you don't want to have evaluated
now (or any expressions with $[], or any commands with $(/ )), you should
escape those % (and $) also.

If you type /ps, you'll see the big /if ... /else ... code show up as the
command to execute.  To make this cleaner, you could also write a function
to do the same thing:

/def dotickstuff = \
    /if (_tick_act == 1) \
      blah blah %; \
    /else \
      etc...
    /endif

/repeat -%ticksize 1 /dotickstuff

I am trying to set up a pair of triggers which will when
people introduce themself to me puts the name in one variable, and the
description in another.
The output looks something like this:
	The blue-eyed charming male human introduces himself as:
	Somename

What I have so far is this,
/def -PCgreen -mregexp -t'^The .*. introduces (himself|herself) as:'
get_desc
=\
	/set descr= %2 %3 %4 %5 %; \
	/def -mregexp -n1 -t'*' = /set name= %1

But the /set name thingy doesn't work... 

~~~~

Also, is there a way I can set up prompts like in shell, for example:
	echo -n "What is your name? :"
	read name

Try instead:
/def -PCgreen -mregexp -t'^The (.+) introduces (him|her)self as:$' get_desc =\
	/set descr=%P1 %; \
	/def -mregexp -n1 -p1000 -F -t'(*)' get_name = /set name=%%P1 %%; /undef
get_name

The things I did different:
Used parantheses in the regexp.  The way you did it it assumes it will be 4
words.  This may be safe, but using parens is more universal.  %P1 substitutes
to the first paren expression.
Added -p1000, this is just a high number to make sure this executes before
anything else.  The -F means other stuff (Hilites, partials, etc) still
trigger on it.
Escaped the % in the /def - Otherwise it would substitute in the 'The'.
Changed .*. to .+ (1 or more of any character)
Gave a name to the /def inside the get_desc one.
Had the get_name macro undefine itself.  Otherwise you'll have a bunch of *
triggers defined.

You can set a prompt with /prompt, and then read a line with the SEND hook,
having it /undef itself afterwards in a similar manner to get_name above.

Oops - my bad.  Because of the -n1 the /undef and macro name aren't
needed.  Serves me right for answering a question on half a brainwave.

/prompt What is your name%;\
/test tfread(name)%;\

/help tfio for useful info about keyboard reading.

How to replace a words in a sentence in order to watch a word1 on
the screen instead of word2. 
For example: 
"Juman told huehuehue what's word2 ?"

and I want to see there (exactly there on the screen):

"Juman told huehuehue what's word1 ?"

I know I can gag a line, then /echo my line there, but that's a
stupid solution.
Is there a way to use substitution or something else here ?

Indeed there is, and /help substitute is where to look for it.

Nods, sure, found it and it works generally, like in help, here
it is:


/def -mregexp -t"abrazak" zastap_to = \
        /test substitute(strcat({PL}, "ARMOR!!", \
            replace("abrazak", "Whatever", {PR})))

And even it works fine, but I have no idea how to do it simplier.
Sure I can all the time change that line in order to substitute
something, but it's tiresome. I'm looking for something better, 

What I want to do is to replace some cyphered names of spells by
correct ones. You know, textes on the screen like that:

Garemon utters the words, 'abrazak'.

I want to do that (substitution) in one line, shorter and
simplier.

Well, here is my substitution:

/def -mregexp -t"Jozek says" jmow_1 = /substitute Jozek says UUUU

works fine, sure, but how to replace Jozek says by a variable,
like %P0 here as I think. Something like this

/def -mregexp -t"Jozek says" jmow_1 = /substitute %P0 UUUU

I want Jozek says to be given here by %P0, UUUU is assed here, in
order to see on the screen just "Jozek says UUUU"

  I'm not quite clear on what you are trying to do, but I think
something like this might work..

/def -mregexp -F -t'abrazak' subst_abrazak = \
	/substitue %{PL}flamedart%{PR}

  Now mind you, I haven't tried this in any way, so I might
have missed something, but I think it should work.

  What should happen is that every time a line containing
abrazak appears we should replace that word with flamedart.
%PL and %PR should contain what left and right of abrazak,
so with a line like:

Garemon utters the words, 'abrazak'.

%PL = "Garemon utters the words, '"
%PR = "'."

%{PL}flamedart%{PR} = Garemon utters the words, 'flamedart'.

  That's the idea, anyway.. Hope you get it to work..

Well, saving macros is clear. If I have the macro:

/def misiek = say s
I can save it to a file krin that way:

/save -a krin misiek

That works, ya, but how to save aliases the same way. Is it
possible at all?

If you mean saving aliases created with /alias, sure it's possible. Not
sure if you want to tho, a simple "/alias blah say blah" creates the
following two macros:

% 255: /def -i alias_body_blah = say blah
% 256: /def -i -p1 -ag -mglob -h'SEND {blah}*' alias_call_blah = /shift 
$[alias !~ "old"]%; /alias_body_blah %*

You'd have to save 'em both, alias_body_<aliasname> and
alias_call_<aliasname>

Maybe that's one of the reasons why /help alias says:
  Using /def instead of /alias is recommended.

I guess this isn't the best way to do it, but it works (or at least it

Typing away merrily, Alexander Wolgast produced the immortal words:

Which is good, except that you need a new macro for each new spell.

How about ...

/def -F -mregexp -t" utters the words '([^']+)'" match_magick = \
	/eval /substitute \
	%{PL} utters the words to invoke "%%{spellstr_%{P1}-?%{P1}?}"
/set spellstr_abrazak=flamedarts
/set spellstr_foo=bar
/set spellstr_funky=wibble!

The ([^']+) matches a sequence of at least one character that isn't a
single quote and, since it's the first parenthesised bit, makes %{P1}
refer to it.  (/help regexp  /help %Pn)

The /eval is bad.  I'm sure it's unnecessary with cleaner syntax, but
I'm at the end of the first in a run of night-shifts and am a little
tired.  ;^)  Anyway, it goes through the rest, evaluating it again.  The
%{P1} gets replaced with the spell-name, and the %% becomes % which hits
the eval as %{spellstr_abrakaz-???} which becomes flamedarts

The -?%{P1}? (from /help substitution, see %{selector-default})
provides a default if the variable isn't defined, so say you get:
PointyHatBloke utters the words 'MyNewSpell'
then you'll get:
PointyHatBloke utters the words to invoke "?MyNewSpell?" instead of
being left with a useless empty pair of quotes.

I vaguely recall that various sets of macros, eg David Moore's & Karen
Etheridge's, use tricks like this - you're effectively fiddling a set of
strings with well-defined names to behave like a hash.

Does this help?

Hrm.  Very bad, I think.  Is it possible to subvert that one with
carefully formed text from the remote side?

Caveat emptor.  I'm going to go sleep.  No doubt I'll wake in the day
in a cold sweat as I realise exactly what can be done to subvert the
eval...

Maybe. But changing [^']+ to [A-Za-z]+ will ensure that no harmful
characters will get through, making it safe.

Besides, who's going to know you can be so attacked?

I play on a MOO that uses colors, and am not able to, as I could on a MUSH,
set things in attributes then call them in poses and such. So, what I want
to do is set an attribute in TinyFugue, which contains a long, commonly-used
string including the right color codes, then have TF substitute it in when
I type in a specific thing, likt tf*<attribte>. So I could type:

This is the colored string: tf*stringvariablename


and it would look at the variable "stringvariablename", and replace the
tf*stringvariablename with the contents of that variable.

Doable? How?

Jamie

Yep, its doable.  Heres an example

/DEF -ag -h"send {stringvariablename}" stringreplace = your text here

This would replace stringvariablename with your text here.  I dunno how
well it would handle it with the wildcard '*' in there tho.

/sub full
command-with-normal-substition-stuff

See /help sub

So, eg, so send the string "tell mickey Network is on fire", you could
use:
/set Target=mickey
/set Message=Network is on fire
tell %Target %Message

You could even:
/set Command=tell
%Command %Target %Message

But that's too silly even for me.  No really.

I was wondering how I would go about writing a macro that would take input
words and parse each word, separating the first letter of each word from
the rest of the word. The reason I want to do this is to allow a "say"
macro that will allow me to output the first letter of each word in a
different color on the mud. Any suggestions/code would be much
appreciated. Thanks in advance!

I think you're taking things a little too personal here, tyler.  If people
don't answer a question, it's usually because they don't understand the
question, don't have time, don't feel like it or something alike. 

Sometimes 20 people jump on one question, sometimes things are quiet. No
one is obliged to answer your questions or write code for you, everyone is
on this list volunteerly and Ken wrote tinyfugue as a hobby. 

I'd advise you to rephrase the question, be more specific and send it
again. Providing a subject on your emails could also draw some attention
and is generally a good idea.

Good luck,
--Duckie

'lo all,

Got a question about triggers, and yeah i have looked through the man page
and help stuff for tiny fugue. So i roughly know how to do it, but just
cant seem to get the syntax right, for the triggers to work everytime.

I normally play on Ack muds. and not all ack muds, have an auto-assist
set up, so what I'd like to set up is, an autoassist, when someone
backstabs or just kills a mob. But more for backstab more than anything
else, so message one normally gets is :

<tank> tries to backstab <mobname>
 
OR

<tank> places <weaponname> in the back of <mobname>

Where tank , mobname and weaponame are replaced, but one wouldnt
neccessarily need to put mobname in as a variable.

Thanks in advance if you can answer my question.

the easiest answer is:

/def -mglob -t"*tries to backstab*" bs_1 = assist

> <tank> places <weaponname> in the back of <mobname>

/def -mglob -t"*places * in the back of*" bs_2 = assist

I'm also playing acks and do not use that kind of assist. Spotted
pple use blink trigger, react on say assist or whatever.
Suppose you want autoassist while afked and know why. If so,
there are better ways.

Before I state my problem, I would like to admit that I have very little
knowlege of TF programming. I've done very simple stuff but if it has a
semicolon in it I'm confused =)

With the self-abasement out of the way, here's my problem:

I wish to develop some keybindings to simulate the Linux Console's
shift-pageup, shift-pagedown functionality. 

I've been experimenting with trying to create a /refresh that is
effectively a /recall -w -q (number of visible lines here). 

This would make a nice starting place, but I am getting confused about
function calls, and the /help didn't answer (or I failed to see it)

;;;; recall.tf creates bindings to allow for scroll-back and scroll-forward in
;;;; the display for the current world.
; NOT WORKING

; /loaded xxx


/def visible_lines = /result (lines() - (visual?(isize+1):0))

/def refresh = /eval /recall -w -q visible_lines()

                   I know this is wrong ^^^ but how do I do it?


Also is there a simple way of calculating a /recall-able range of lines
given that you want to start N lines back? Say, I want 21 lines starting
350 lines back in the current world's buffer, is there an easy way?


Thanks in Advance for any comments or information!

PGUP goes into scrollback mode, during this mode any input from the mud
            your on gets buffered.
PGDN will move you down thru the scroll back mode.
ESC will take you out of scrollback.


Good luck,

I'm still teaching myself about TF, but many, many basic things
are still unclear for me :)
Like missed trailing and the text about following whitespace.
It's still intuitive for me. What are the rules connected with
that, where should exactly be a trailing "\" in order to force tf
to add next line to the previous.
for example:

/alias unkas say What to write here? Ok, got the idea: \
             blabla

doesn't work like

/alias unkas say What to write here? OK, got the idea: blabla

same with the macro:

/def unkas = say What to write here? Ok, got the idea: \
             blabla

Here it works fine, but why exactly, no idea :) :

/def -mregexp -t"TICK !!!" = /setenv your_tick=$[studnia_tick+1]%; \
     /substitute TICK !!! (%your_tick HURRY UP!!!).

Hmm, what are the basic rules, that allows to add blabla to the
rest of (upper) line.
It's confusing I'm able to make really many things (sure can't
compare with the half of the list, but still) in tf and got
troubles with such an easy, as I expect thing :)
I know it's a "lama_question", but :) 

Anyone?

When my trigger is for instance:
/def -mglob -t"*ulala*" ulak_1 = say s

It's easy to undefine it, just /undef ulak_1. I'm interested how
to define it's again. Sure I can write it manually again, load
from the file it's in, set an aliac prolly that define that whole
line and other a little stupid methods.

Are there methods that allow to make something like that:

/def_trig_again ulak_1

I'm looking for the command in tf (still haven't found), suspect
there is no possibility. Am I right???

If somebody wrote that on his own, please help me with your lines
of code.

use /edit command, to disable it:

/edit -c0 ulak_1

this sets the chance the trigger will be executed to 0%, when you want it
back in action, all you need to do is to set the execution chance back to
the default 100% by:

/edit -c100 ulak_1

try /help edit for more information (it actually contains one example of
what you asked).

Sorry if this has come up before, but I just now got on the list.

If I hit Ctrl-P, the system sometimes processes this as a print 
screen, instead of buffer recall.  Is there anything I can do to avoid 
this problem?  My printer is probably set up wrong, but I get an 
error message, with the options to abort or retry, and usually end 
up having to shut down and restart because it won't die gracefully.

Any help is appreciated.

The only way around this is to disable the PrintScreen functions, It should
be possible, though I've not done it.  This problem seems to only effect
Windows 9X and not NT or 2000

I was wondering if there is any way to avoid /recalling into the history?

I have been working on a history-scrolling mechanism for TF, which
actually works, except that scrolling forward will continually add its own
output to the head of the history. You get output like this if /recall
showing line number is used:


138: You say "Hello"
139: Bit whispers "Does it work yet?"
...

149: 138: You say "Hello"
150: 139: Bit whispers "Does it work yet?"
...


I saw an attribute that avoids history (but still logs), but no way of
applying to a /recall. I can't use a regexp, because I plan on turning off
line numbers, and so nothing for the regexp to grab.

Actually, I might end up rethinking my scheme entirely, if someone can
tell me how to create a world without a connection, so that I can dump
output into there. world HistoryScroll or something, ignore this world for
/recall, and recall all other worlds into this one. Whenever switched
away, or you are at the current line of output in history, switch back to
your remembered current world and destroy the history world. Hmm. I can
see some problems with this but...


Any comments/ideas/obvious faults?

one of the trigs I use most is something like
/def prep = /input /def -n1 -Fp100 -mglob -t'**' 1_hot = result

it also has a few dokey word and char lefts to put the prompt in 
between the 1st & 2nd *

I think with each of the triggers you want redefined you need to 
write a trigger like 

/def_ulak1_again = /def -mglob -t"*ulala*" ulak_1 = say s

because I think once it is undefed it is gone... But you already
sugested this.

Or you may try 

/def ulak_1_ = /input /def -mglob -t"*ulala*" ulak_1 = say s

is that any improvement on typing? I lke to think of it as coding on
the fly.

hippy mudling

Hello. I'm knew to this list, but have been using tinyfugue for a while,
and noone I ask knows the answer:
Is there a way to setting up tf in visual mode to support a separate
input window for each world?  I generally take a while typing in a pose or
writing something up, and in that time another world goes active.  As far
as I know I can't respond to that world without first clearing the buffer,
by
whispering the text to myself or somesuch.  I was wondering if tf had an
easier way to doing it, like is available in other win95 clients, for
instance: each world has its own input window.

(Also it'd help avoid misposing.)

Thanks,
Alan

Use the keyboard stack. Need to load kbtools.tf or something, cant
remember now and dont have access to the environement. Basically it
allows you to save (half) typed lines by pressing esc then arrow down.

Then you can recall the command to the inut lin with esc then arrow up.

The kbstack is FILO.

That's not the command, but I think you want something like "%;"

Does anyone have any idea? I have been unable to figure out a way to
/recall arbitrary lines without the /recalled lines ending up in the
history, thus the next /recall. This doesn't quite seem right, and is
causing me no end of trouble on a project of mine.

Other than a source patch, is there any tfcode way to stop this?

I have coded a semi-good, working tt++-like grouping macro. I think I
posted it here a while ago, along with some necessary changes to
spedwalk.tf. 

Anyway, if anyone is interested, mail me.. 

Note that the scripts might need som changes to get rid of a few
warnings.. I quit bothering when I stopped playing. (God knows why I'm
still on this list.)

/repeat specifically waits 1 second between repeats.

Try: putting this into your .tfrc:

/addworld -Ttelnet Holy 140.78.214.101 2001

There's probably a better type for that muck than 'telnet', but I've no
idea what it might be :)

You can connect to it by using /connect holy, or it will just start up
when you run TF.

You can specify the time /repeat takes until the next execution, this and
many other things are explained in the TF's help files. Try '/help repeat'
and you'll see exactly how it works. For tintin emulation, there is a
macroset called tintin.tf in the tf library directory, perhaps you should
try it out.

Yeah Ive run in to this before (on a previously posted macro that
would input and dokey wlefts to get the cursor in the right position
for my much touted 'programming on the fly')

I seem to remember that there is a way to speed it up. 1 second or
whatever is the default (probably set in a variable somewhere), but this
can be changed. I believe it was somewhere in /help repeat that I dont 
have access to at the moment.

Someone asked me if a GUI front-end for tf exists, and I remember
something about Crescendo, though I couldn't find it anywhere on the web.
Is the thing still alive? If so, where can I find it?

Thanks,
Duckie

I have seen this project recently. They have released version 1.0 in early
March and it looks like the project have not been updated since. I have
plans to write my own GTK+ frontend to TF. The home page of crescendo is
at http://crescendo.edenproject.org/

Yes, its alive and under some decent development. There has been a release
and probably a maintainence release will be out soon. 
http://crescendo.edenproject.org is the site you are looking for.

There was an update in May,  I'll be doing a maintainence release. I lost
one of my developers, and instead of starting a new project, perhaps we 
can combine forces?  There are some reasons for not useing plain GTK+, if
you are intersted in discussing them, etc :)  optionally, if you have 
some suggestions for Crescendo I'd be happy to take them.

We want this, and that, we demand the share in that
and most of that, some of this, and all of that. less 
of that, and more of this, and plenty of this, Nothing, 
We want it now, I want it yesterday, I want more tommorow, 
and the demands will all be changed then, so stay awake.
