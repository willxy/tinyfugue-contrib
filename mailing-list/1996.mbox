Hiya, 
	Was wondering if any one new how to set the size of the output
screen? I have my terminal set up to display 50 lines, yet tinyfugue 
seems to only want to use the first 25 :).
Any, and all help would be appreciated.

You didn't say what sort of OS you were using, but on most UN*X terms
you can use:
	stty rows 49
	export LINES=49 (or 'setenv LINES 49' if you use a csh varient)

then run tf.

Somehow, and don't ask me why, to get the term to work with more lines
the standard UN*X envrioment (eg to get 49 lines from ls) I have to run
tf first! Only after that will the term work right.

Thanks for the added feature Hawkeye! ;)

Good luck,
johnb

   Actually, if it's a UNIX system that has the X Windows System on it,
you should be able to do just 'eval `resize`' from the command line and
it will set the stty and environment values correctly.  (Note that the
quotes around resize are _back_ quotes, not the more usual forward ones.)
This command was set up for xterm windows but will work on anything that
supports vt100 or ansi terminals definitely and should work on anything
that properly handles cursor movement semantics.

This version is nowhere near 400 lines, but does everything except
recall *exactly* a screenful:

    /set bg_output=off

    /def -p1 -ag -F -h'WORLD' world_recall = \
        /echo -- ---- world %1 ----%; 
        /let old_more=%more%;
        /set more=off%;
        /quote -S /echo -- `/recall /25%; 
        /set more=%old_more

By turning %more off, it can recall more than a screenful without causing
a --More-- prompt.  A few lines will scroll off the top, and you'll be
left with a screenful, and %more is restored to its original value.
One problem with this (and the 400 line version, at least as you described
it) is that you can't distinguish old recalled lines from new lines you
haven't seen yet.

In 3.5 beta 1, you will be able to replace the abitrary 25 used in the
above example with $[lines()], to get very close to exactly a screenful.

What's the problem?  As I understand it, you want your borg to do a WHO,
and reformat its output into one line?  So define a trigger on the first
line of WHO, that defines triggers on "*" and on the last line.  The
"*" trigger appends the name to the contents of a tf variable; the higher
priority last-line trigger undefines the "*" trigger and displays the
contents of that tf variable.

You can't use them in any way; they are only displayed, for debugging
purposes.  But you mentioned telnet commands that are sent after each
message; the only things that could be is the EOR or GOAHEAD commands,
which are used to indicate prompts.  You can use the PROMPT hook to
catch that.

Err, I'm not familiar with multichar. While I know "speedwalk" and "map"
from Tintin++, I'm not very sure what "ignore" means. And I sure don't
know what multichar can do.

BTW, speedwalk and map are not builtin. There are files in the library
that provide these. /help library and /help utility will give you a short
introduction, but you'll have to go to the directory and examine the files
in the end. Just the beginning of each file will usually do.

To use speedwalk and map, you must load the files. To load files this
files you must do :
/load tf.lib/speedwalk.tf
/load tf.lib/map.tf

of course this only works if you have your files in tf.lib directory :)

When in tf, to start speedwalk, just type 
/speedwalk
from now on, you can type multiple directions in one line. To turn
speedwalk off, just type /speedwalk again. More info is in speedwalk.tf
file.

To use map, please read map.tf file ... I never use it, but if you read
the beginning of the file, you'll now how to use it ... ;)

  How can I send ^C (ctrl-C) to the remote host with tf?

Just just typing ^ and C doesn't seem to work (quitting programs etc).

thanks.

On the command line:
  /eval /send -n \3

Or, you can bind it to a key (other than ^C) if you like:
  /bind ^X = /send -n \3

I'm trying to set up some Macros on TF, but am having problems with line 
spacing and returns. I noticed that the program uses it's own %-cmds for 
numerous things. MUSHes also have many %cmds. I'm trying to have a tabbed 
ljust() function, and the line won't take up the full 80 columns, so the 
next one should start on the next line. Instead, the first line starts at 
the beginning of the line, and the next one starts right after it. So, 
what should look like this:

     This is a tabbed Ljust()ed column
     This is line 2 of a tabbed Ljust()ed column
     This is line 3 of a tabbed Ljust()ed column

Instead looks like this:

This is a tabbed tabbed Ljust()ed column This is line 2 of a tabbed 
Ljust()ed column This is line 3 of a tabbed Ljust()ed column

What do you use in place of %r's %t's, and %b's when making Macros on 
TinyFugue? Could someone give me an example?

Ok, just entered this mailing list because I found a bug, so excuse me if 
this has already been assessed...


Ok, say I open up an xterm to the full size of the screen (>80 chars). I 
then load up tf and go into a world, where output is guaranteed to be 
<=80 per line. I then proceed to shrink the xterm width wise, thereby 
reducing the number of displayable chars per line, but lets say it is 
still >80 characters. tf doesn't know this, and shrinks it's display 
accordingly, as if the xterm was exactly 80 chars when it first opened, 
and then calculated the difference the window was shrunk, and shrank it's 
own output according to that difference.

Just seems to me that tf isn't taking into account the full size of it's 
display when it first opens. I know this is a bug because it used to work 
in my old version (tf v3.4a16). 

Also, what happened to the cool looking line separator for input in X (as 
opposed to running it in char mode from a virtual console)? Would it 
really be that hard to display it too inside X?

I'm in the process of writing a MOO style server in Java.  The addition of
the telnet NAWS option was absolutely wonderful (from my point of view ;),
and I'm wondering if you have any plans to implement something similar for
the telnet TERMINAL TYPE option.

<which'd be really cool *silly grin*>

Oh, one other thing... I'm not sure whether this is tinyfugue or my fault,
buut... on some terminals (for example a linux console), I occasionally
get an additional blankline on the screen (say, in the ascii logo that I
dump out before the login prompt).  I haven't had this problem with any of
the telnet programs I've used, nor do I have it when running tf in an X
window - its only on a couple of terminals...?

Thanks,
Paul

I have developed a descer object code for TinyMUSH that's been very 
successful. What I would very much like to do is translate the actual 
MUSH code into a TF macro format, so that the descer parent object need 
not even be present on the MUSH. It's a relatively simple task, overall; 
unfortunately I have realized that I will not likely have the time to 
learn much about TF macros and functions to efficiently do this before 
it's needed (September). 

I'm sending this to the list in the hopes that there's someone out there 
bored enough and proficient enough with mushcode and TF macros & 
functions to be able and willing to do this conversation process. It 
should be a straight conversation, keeping most of the command names as-is 
(adding the obligatory / prefix, of course). The main difference is in 
the handling of the text of the descriptions and such themselves: I'd 
like them to be able to be stored off-MUSH, in the user's own directory.

Failing volunteers to tackle the conversion process itself, tips would be 
on how to handle the desc/file system.

The code itself is located at http://www.fortnet.org/~rina/code/rd30b.code

Please email me at rina@pobox.com if you're at all interested. Thanks!

Well, just as a suggestion to what your problem might be:

Xterm is a VT100 compatible terminal.

VT100 has a rather interesting little feature. Namely, if you place the cursor
at the very char character of a line and print/type one more character, it's
cursor wont move to the next line and leave a character at the last colomn of
the old row, as you might expect. Rather, it will print the character without
moving! Hince, if you press return following that, you'll get to the next
line. On a terminal that don't have this feature, you would already be on the
next line, and pressing return then will cause you to go one more line,
leaving you with an empty line. So, if you have text that goes beyond colomn
79 (assuming you have an 80 character display, and count characters  as 1-80)
and then adds a return, you will get different behaviour on different
terminals.

This would make it look correct in an xterm for example, but not on a FreeBSD
console, for example (since the FreeBSD console does not have the "stay put"-
feature). I don't know about the linux console. I thought it DID have that
feature, though. Hmm...

Oh well, just a suggestion... Look into it. Good luck.

   /Mikael

That is curious... unfortunately, this is happening to me on a centered
logo.  It *is* happening on the longest lines only, but that longest line
doesn't go anywhere near column 80.

ho hum.  Such is life, I guess.

Well... There's likely to be spaces or something following the last visible
character on that row, so that it IS 80 characters. You can always check, at
least, and complain to the one responsible for it, if you I am right. :-)
Set TF in emulation=raw and turn on logging to a file, and go to where ever
that logo is, and then quit, and view the file in vi or something and examine
if there are spaces or so after.

> ho hum.  Such is life, I guess.

Possibly. :-)
However this not really something to continue discussing on the list, so reply
in private email if you want to reply.

Ok here's a silly one, but for the life of me I can't get it to work.

I'm trying to disable or gag the messages "Activity in world..."

Hey all,

There's something I've been wondering about for a while.  There are often,
in the many worlds out there, cases where certain information is sent
merely for information sake.

I'm talking about GAME messages, often connects, disconnects, etc.

What I'd like to do is to be able to, say, have messages of the format
GAME: * NOT trigger the activity indicator (and not be added to the queue
in worldqueue), but still be output when we shift to that world.

In other words, I want a gag that doesn't gag. :)  Anyone with any ideas
out there?

Keldin, PatternFall MUSH

I've been using Tf for quite some time now but there's some things I still
don't seem to be able to figure out.

I am playing a playerkilling mud in which it's VERY important that I can get
my client to respond to triggers immediately and to be able to
repeat commands in a VERY fast manner.

For example, I'd like to be able to repeat the command "struggle" when I
have a trigger activated. I want the struggle command to be done say 30
times in 1 second, or as fast as possible. Currenly I can get the struggle
command to be repeated 30 times, but it's like 1 time per round of combat,
which is WAY too slow, I'd like 30 struggles in 1 round of combat.

Is there a way I can get tinyfugue to respond faster and execute commands
very quickly? I know of other clients that people are using (zmud?) that
can do this.

Thanks in advance.

try /ptime 0, it will turn off the default 1-second delay between repeated
commands

There are two ways to do this. One, in the repeat command itself, you can
specify a time between each repeat in seconds.

From the help file:
/repeat

  Usage:

  /REPEAT [-w[<world>] [-<time>] <count> <command>

If you set the time to "-0" the commands will go out as fast as tf can
send them.

Another solution, which I use since I never liked the 1 second default
delay, is to add "/set ptime=0" in your .tfrc. This sets the default
repeat time to 0.

Beware, however, in that this can cause mistaken repeat commands to
become very spammy very fast.

To All tcp.com Users and List Members,

	As you may have noticed, tcp.com was unavailable Friday night
through Monday morning this last weekend, which made all services
unavailable during that time.  This also cause some problems with blank
messages or repeated messages showing up after the system was back.  I am
still looking into the latter problem. 

	For those who have been worrying about tcp.com's financial 
stability, you might have easily made the assumption that the downtime 
was due to financial problems.  Rest assured that while we still have a 
substantial deficit, things aren't that dire yet.  Your support is still 
quite appreciated and you can find out all about how to donate, current 
status, etc. at http://www.tcp.com/donate/ with your web browser.

	I was on vacation this weekend, and our incoming router hung 
Friday night shortly after I left.  This router has been reliable after a 
hardware upgrade several months ago and has not had many problems that
weren't related to power outages, telco problems, or my own errors.

	Because I was out of range of my pager, I was not able to receive 
any reports of it being down this way, however I do have a cell phone 
number with voice mail which I make available to certain people to report 
problems with.  I obviously don't want to broadcast this number to 
everyone, but if you want it let me know.

	This site is a volunteer effort.  Most of the systems support 
work is done solely by myself.  Because of this, things like this will 
occasionally happen.  If by some miracle this site gets enough funding 
that 24/7 support is possible, I'm sure we'll consider it.  Until then, 
keep in mind that we're making do with what we have and that most of us 
have jobs or school to worry about in addition.

	Also due to the volume of mail regarding this downtime, I cannot 
respond personally to all the inquiries.  Hopefully this should answer 
the majority of questions raised.

I'm using tf and love it but I would really like to be able to have
the MOO send me my program, then continue, then when I'm done with my
editing I would send it back.  I can do this now but tf is frozen while
it waits for me to complete editing.  I was hopeful that someone else
out there had already written something to do this.  Anyone?
  I'm running Unix and X and I keep my tf version up as best I can. 8^)

We're back up and hopefully this will be the last of troubles for a while.

Read on if you are interested in details...

I had prior plans to be in the Monterey area with my dad doing the tourist
thing today.  Since PacBell hadn't arrived by the time I had to leave, my
roommate Trent Parker <automan@shoreside.com> was left in charge of
handling things. 

PacBell arrived around noon and set up a new cable to use, and by shortly
after 2, a healthy circuit was tested, and ready to use.  Trent fired up
our equipment, and after some twiddling, the line was up and running, and
the equipment was reporting no errors.

However, shortly before 4, the southwestern united states was hit with a
major power outage, which included tcp.com headquarters.  Although some 
areas, like where I was in Monterey, were out less than an hour, power 
was out here until after 9.  Trent got most of the equipment here up 
and running by the time I arrived 15 minutes after power was restored.
A few remaining glitches kept us from getting back completely until 
about 10:30.

Hi all!

Please forgive me if this questions has been answered, but...

I just downloaded alpha 20 and compiled it.  Unfortunately, it can't
seem to connect properly to worlds.  Under alpha 16, I had two tinys
and two abers, and tf could tell the difference... to the tinys it
sent "connect name password" and to the abers it sent "name\rpassword\r"
as it should.

Under alpha 20, no matter what mud type I specify (even if I specify
none!), it sends the following to the server:

	name
	password
	name
	password
	name
	password
	connect name password
	connect name password

I made no chnages in my local .tfrc files, I just moved up from 16 to 20.
Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated!

Glen

I asked the same thing a couple months ago and have not seen any replies
yet so I downgraded back to 16.  If anyone knows anything about this
please speak up!

I was wondering if there's an easy (or possibly more difficult) way to
disable all currently defined macros, then re-enable them some time in the
future. Same for a single macro.

Reason I want the is that if I create a trigger that's active, but
I wanna go idle and don't want the trigger to activate when I'm gone.

Thanks in advance
 John Jamulla

Since I'm not the only person reporting it, I guess I'm not
imagining the problem I reported last night in which TinyFugue
alpha 20 (and possibly back through alpha 17?) fails to connect
to MUDs properly.  So I thought I would send some more details
to assist whoever in checking this.

I'm running alpha 20 on SCO OpenServer 5 (i486, 66 MHz, 16MB).
Alpha 16 ran fine.  In alpha 16, when I would connect to an
abermud, or a tinymud, only the correct connection string would
be sent.  In alpha 20, however, no matter what MUD type I 
specify, it sends the name and password three times, followed
by the connect line one or two times.  It's almost as though
stdlib.tf is /eval'ing all the possible connect types, and
running them all, rather than just the correct one.

I tried putting in some test /echo lines to see what was
executing, but I evidently don't know enough about stdlib.tf
to do it right ... :-(

Interestingly, the system starts with /visual on by default
now, whereas in the past it was /visual off.

I'd hate to get left at alpha 16 - not that it's a bad release!
:-) - so if anyone could comment or advise on this, I'd be
grateful!

Just for laughs, I went backwards through every alpha release,
compiling each one to see where the /connect problem started.

The bug is only present in alpha 19 and alpha 20.  Alpha 18
works fine... 

That's about all the debugging I can do here :-(

I'm just coming up to speed with tf and I haven't been able to do this
yet....

I want tf to resend the last line sent if I just hit enter. Essentially I
want the input buffer to be preloaded with the last line out. If I type
any character blank the input buffer and start building it with what I am
typing...if I just hit enter then send it.

So in a situation  where I want to ge 5e 2n I would enter e then press
enter 5 times then type n and hit enter twice. If I want to pick a lock I
just keep hitting enter until successful instead of enter and ^p.

Makes movement much easier as it cuts out a lot of key strokes...besides
I'm used to that behavior.

Any pointers/ideas on how to do this?

Thanks.

Darren

I doubt if you relly want this, but it sure is possible.
Just add two macros:

/def -mregexp -h"SEND ^$" tmp1 = /send %last
/def -mregexp -h"SEND ^[^$]" tmp2 = /set last=%0%;/send %last

And to send an empty line, you would /send.
Note that /send will never activate a SEND hook.

try this:
/hook send * = /send %0%; /grab %0

that won't blank it if you type something else though....

well there is a spedwalk.tf file in the library that lets you type 5n

One of my favorite methods of programming has always been to open a vi
window (in X) next to my tf window then just use X's cut and paste to
send the program to the Mud, this used to work fine under a16 but since
I upgraded to a20 I now get these symptoms:  After the paste it
'appears' as though the program only got partially sent, I can see a
line midway through my program as the last input line, yet when I type
any keystroke another line appears and is sent, simply holding down any
key will send the program one line per keystroke.  When the program
get's sent completely I type ^U and clear the wasted keystrokes.
  This is my first bug post to this list so if you need more info please
feel free to ask.  If you have a solution to this problem aside from
going back to a16 please let me know.

Hi,

I use tf now since some time and I really like it.
Now I have a problem: I want to do something like first repeat one command
often (10 times), then execute another command, and all of this in one
makro.
Now if I use something like
  /def helpmakro = /repeat 10 <command1>
  /def makro = /helpmakro %; <command2>
this works fine, but I need this second makro. Is there anything like
brackets to code it like 
  /def makro = { /repeat 10 <command1> } %; <command2>       ?

Yours,

    Susan Dittmar

this last one is fine if you take out the { }'s

You want to disable triggers, not macros.  Disable all of them with
"/set borg=off" (see /help: triggers, %borg).  Disable a single trigger
with "/edit -c0 <name>" (see /help: triggers, /edit).

Better yet,

/def -mregexp -F -h"SEND ^$" etc
/def -mregexp -F -h"SEND ^[^$]" etc

so the SEND hooks still get activated.

Last night in bed I had a brainstorm for a method (For those of you
familiar with the page extension common on TinyMUCK FuzzBall, and possibly
TinyMUCK 2.2/2.3 that allows custom formats) to hilight the from, to, and
body of a page, without needing to know the format the page will be in. 
The trick is you need to have a 'prepend' to the page that contains all
the info, then TF can catch that, strip it off, and set temporary hilights
on the guts of the page..  It works great... Once..  After that the string
gets really frotzed..  I think I may know what the problem is (I use
/substitute, then proceed to use data from the origonal match) If you
wanna play with it, pages need to be recieved in this format: ##PAGE>
fromname #<># to-list #><# Body <EGAP## Origonal format page here The
to-list is a list of names recieving the page (Such as Johnny, Fred and
you) Then the macro is:
/def -p1000 -F -mregexp \
-t'^##PAGE> ([^ ]+) #<># ([^ ]+((, [^ ]+)* and [^ ]+)?) #><# (.*) <EGAP##' \
catchpage = \
  /substitute %PR %; \
  /def -p999 -F -mregexp -t\"($(/escape \(\)\[\]\|\*\+\?\.\\ %P2))\" -P1Ccyan pageto %; \
  /def -p998 -F -mregexp -t\"($(/escape \(\)\[\]\|\*\+\?\.\\ %P5))\" -P1Cblue pagebody %; \
  /def -p997 -F -mregexp -t\"($(/escape \(\)\[\]\|\*\+\?\.\\ %P1))\" -P1Cyellow pagefrom = \
    /undef pageto %%; \
    /undef pagebody %%; \
    /undef pagefrom

Moving the /substitute to the end does indeed fix the problem.
(Heehee, don't you love doing really really bizarre stuff that uncovers 
bugs that wouldn't ever have been noticed and hence not a problem in any 
other circumstance? :)

You don't need the global variable and extra hook:

/def -mglob -h"SEND {}" blank_repeat = /send - $(/recall -i - -2)

Heres my page hilight, working, and only hilighting recipient if it's 
more then just 'you' and adding a recipient list to the line if none was 
present in the page format.
Also included is a macro /setpage which will set the page #prepend format 
appropriately in the current world, assuming you are using MUFpage by 
Foxen.  Any other page that allows prepends you're on your own..  As I 
said, the format needs to be:
##PAGE> From_name #<># To_list #><# Message <EGAP## Origonal page format
Where the from_name doesn't have a space in it (If names can have spaces, 
change the ([^ ]+) to (.+)), the To_list is a comma seperated list of 
names without spaces (As in PersonA or PersonA, PersonC and PerconC).  
This will probably puke if the message has a #><# or <EGAP## surrounded 
by spaces in it, but how likely is that?
NOTE: Change attributes to taste.  In addition you might want to add a /beep.

/repeat normally executes commands asynchronously; that means they are
not executed immediately, just scheduled to be executed later.  "Later"
might be 0 seconds later, but it is always _after_ anything directly
following the /repeat (<command2> in this case).

To execute the commands synchornously ("in-line"), use /repeat -S.

/help topics: /repeat, processes.

It's due to a bug in case conversion under non-ansi compilers.  It
breaks all glob matching; in this particular example, it's causing all
the LOGIN hooks to match, instead of just one.

If you have an ansi compiler, use it.  Otherwise, you'll have to
wait for the next release.

I have a slightly modified version of hilite_page macro, and I am
running the -same- hilite_page under 3.5a11 and 3.5a20. 

The MUSH I am playing heavily relies on ANSI, and there is a problem I
noticed under a20, but that does not occur under a11.

Somethimes (and not always), after ANSI from the MUSH, my hilites will
stop hiliting (and that's all of them). I have also managed to find a
pretty spammy ANSI sequence that seems to fix my problem:

iter(x r g y b m s,ansi(##,repeat(repeat(--,20),20)))

(yeah it sucks to do this often)

Also, the following hilite will not fire on a20, but it does on a11:

/def -ip2ah -mglob -t'You paged *' ~hilite_page8

I think there might be some other hilites that are not firing, but this
is the one I am pretty sure just plain doesn't work on a20.

Version details:

3.5a20 for SunOS Generic Patch 5.3
and
3.5a11 for SunOS Generic_101945-37 5.4

They were built on the same amchine with the same compiler and options,
but not at the same time.

Any ideas apreciated,

I have a question about prompts...
When I play my regular MUD, a Diku mud, I see my prompt on the 'command' 
line at the bottom of the screen, as I should.  but when I play some 
other muds, such as a Circle or a Merc based mud, I only see the prompt 
at the top of text sent back from the game (ie at the beginning of a room 
description)  Any ideas why?  I am using 35a15 on a Linux 1.2.13 system.  
Its probably something I have to do in the world file, but version a15 
doesnt have help for /addworld so any help would be appreciated!

I was just wondering if anyone can shed some light on this problem I seem 
to be having with TinyFugue.

I first started using TF 33b1 which was installed on my ISP and it ran 
fine, then about 2 months ago I start getting the message

% Connection to World closed: recv: Operation would block

It didn't happen much at first but has been getting much worse lately. 
Thinking maybe it just might be a bug in that version I installed TF 
35a20 in my personal directory and ran it, but now instead I get

% Connection to World closed: recv: Resource temporarily unavailable

just as frequently. This is getting very annoying especially when I am 
coding a large project or chatting with people ICly. My uname data is:
SunOS parka 5.5 Generic_103093-03 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-10

Any suggestions??

Everyonce in a while, and lately, exceedingly more often, I've been 
experiencing a problem with TinyFugue. The version is 3.3b1, so it is 
rather old, but it's the version that's ran globally on my net provider, 
and I don't really have the online diskspace to set up a newer copy of 
it, and I'm not even sure if that'd solve the problem. What happens is 
that it once in a while cuts me off randomly, giving me this message:
% Connection to <host> closed: recv: Operation would block
and then it cuts me off from that host. Sometimes i'm right in the middle 
of coding something, others I'm right in the middle of Roleplaying 
something that could cost my PC its life. In any case, it's annoying. 
Anyone know what's causing this and how to fix it? Does it look like a 
problem with my ISP, or with the way the program is set up? If I got my 
ISP to upgrade to the newer version, would that fix it?

Thanx,

Its a bug in the SunOS, as far as i have been told, as i am on a computer
almost exactly the same as yours.  I cannot talk to the system admins about
it unfortunately as its a university staff account, and i would have to
tell them what i am doing, which would get the account barred.

I have had this problem with every version of tf i have used.  I am
currently using 35 alpha 20.  The message i get is the second one mentioned
above when using this version.

I also here there are patches for the telnet aspect of the OS, but i am
unsure if that included one for SunOS 5.5.

I would also be very interested if anyone knows of the way to fix this problem.

My God, I'm depressed!  Here I am, a computer with a mind a thousand
times as powerful as yours, doing nothing but cranking out fortunes and
sending mail about softball games.  And I've got this pain right
through my ALU.  I've asked for it to be replaced, but nobody ever
listens.  I think it would be better for us both if you were to just
log out again.

Is not what I meant - I'm using partial hilights..  What I want to do is, 
say, if a word appears in the middle of a whisper, which is hilighted 1 
color, it will change it to another color (Not adding it to the previous 
color like it does now)  And this needs to be without knowing what the 
word is ahead of time, cause it's more then 1 word.

I know this list usually features complex questions, and this prolly has a
simple answer, but, I promised my brother and his GF I'd ask. Please bear
with our communal ignorance.

How do you hilight messages that are produced by TF, but not part of the MU*
output. For example:

% Activity in world *worldname*.

Also, I once saw mention of the 'ding' or 'beep' function, where you could
(apparently) cause a speaker beep sound when set up. Am I right in thinking
this exists? And, if so, how might I set up a macro or other command to
trigger when there is new activity in a world?

Thank you for your patience with a couple rank newbies :).

Now we are on the subject of hiliting tf messages, how could i gag them
when i start up tf, as i now get quite a spam of % redefined .... and %
loading commands from ... messages which i'm sick of seeing, unless they
tell me i screwed up something in a file.

use a hook.
/def -ahCyellow -hactivity
makes the activity notice yellow, for example.

yeah, it's /beep. either /def -ab -hactivity or /hook activity = /beep
should work.

you can also use the /hook command, of course. check out 'help hooks'

Is there any way of achieving a logical NOT within a /gag line?
I need to gag all lines of a certain pattern unless they contain
a particular word or playername.
eg gag        'VIDINFO - * enters the room.'
but don't gag 'VIDINFO - Richard enters the room.'
Alternatively, is there any way i can trigger off a gagged line?
Any suggestions appreciated.
Mung.
I use version 3.5 a20 btw

	Triggers have priorities, and the higher priority ones get tried
first.  So you can make a trigger which does nothing at a higher
priority than the one which gags:


/def -p2 -t'VIDINFO - Richard enters the room.' vid_dont_gag =
/def -p1 -ag -t'VIDINFO - * enters the room.' vid_gag =

Hi, got another one of those questions that could likely be answered in 
the help but I can't seem to find it.... .is there a way to 'gag' text or 
something so that you see it, but it doesn't go to your log? maybe gag is 
the wrong term, but I think you know what i mean..... so like pages or 
something is filtered out....
Thanks muchly,
Alice

/def -aG -t'whatever'
(that's a capital G) prevents it from being recorded in history with
/recall... if you're doing a /log it will log everything that's not gagged
so that won't work...

But if you're /relogging (usually preferable), it works quite well.

Ok.... let's try this again.... yes, I know how to gag it so it won't go 
to history... that part was very clear in the help :) I want to set it so 
that certain lines I see but don't go into my log.... even gagging for a 
/relog wouldn't work because then I wouldn't see them in the first place :)
(and besides, while /relog is quite nice when you suddenly want something 
that just happened logged, since it won't seem to recognize that I have 
wraplog on, I much prefer /log when I know ahead of time I want to be 
logging)

I'm looking at situations where I'm roleplaying on a mush, the 
admin/judge/ref wants a log kept but I want to weed out channels and such 
spamm that would have nothing to do with the roleplaying displayed in the log

Wouldn't /def -aG -t'whatever' gag = /echo %0 work?

Try this one out. I use it to filter out all Org (chat line) output in
AmberMUSH when logging. Just set the RegExp to catch all the output you 
_want_ in your log. This is best done by logically negating (ie. using
a leading '^' inside square brackets) the _unwanted_ output.
Just to make the example a little clearer: all Org output in AmberMUSH is 
preceeded by a '<' char. Changing the RegExp to match one or more complex
patterns should not be a problem.


/def -mregexp -p10 -F -t"^[^<]" = /echo -wAmberLog - %*
/def lon = /log -wAmberLog

/addworld AmberMUSH muds.okstate.edu 5150
/addworld AmberLog dummy dummy


Now activate selective logging with '/lon'.

The trigger /echos all sanctioned output to a dummy world (in this case
'AmberLog') and logs from there. Simple, although it is a bit roundabout.

Note: In general, the /def should be set to a higher priority than all 
non-fallthrough output triggers to insure that it will be checked once 
for each line.

How might one construct a trigger or hook to automatically queue up a /retry
when a world crashes?

Use that:
/def -p1 -ag -mregexp -t'^VIDINFO - (.*) enters the room.$'
/def -p2 -t'VIDINFO - Richard enters the room.'
first trigger gags you first matching, and second ungags Richard entry.
Simple, yeah?

/def -h"DISCONNECT" -i reconnect = /retry (etc)

I suppose DISCONNECT hook also tells you what world was disconnected. Please
/help hooks (hook?) for more information.

	You've asked it to match on the string "%CODE: ".  To have tf do
substitutions into those args, you can either use /eval or nest your
macro creation in another macro.  In both cases, you'd need to double
any %'s that occur in macro after the =.

/eval \
    /def -mregexp -t'%CODE: ' =\
        /echo I got the code! -- %%1

Or similar.

No one answered about arrays, so I'm gonna explain it in a little more
detail so that you understand what I am trying to do:

I want to have a variable, say it's call STUFF.  I want to:
	/set STUFF=sword,knife,axe

What I want to be able to do with that variable(which is kinda an array)
is break it up in to seperate words by the ','.

Even better than that, I would like to be able to count how many words
are in there and refrence each word like STUFF(1), STUFF(2), and so on.

Any ideas on how I could do this?

Forget arrays, use lists. Check out the lisp library. If lisp can get
away without arrays, so do you. :-)

Yes, lists. Check out lisp.tf. :-)

Anyway, you can do some things with regexp function. Check out these
macros:

;; Simple list building

/def  -aCcyan    -mregexp -t'(.*) has fired .* at you'          hit0 = \
        /if /test ! $[strstr(%enemy,%P1) + 1]%;\
        /then /set enemy %enemy %P1 %;\
        /endif
                               
/def enemies = /set enemy

/def  -t"*  Roll: {*}" rolls1 = \
  /set rolls=$[rolls + %L]%; \

with the variable, not having to be redefined each the the variable
changes.

Define a macro to redefine the trigger:

  /def set_code = \
      /def -mregexp -t'%{1}: ' code_trigger = /echo I got the code! -- %%1

and instead of "/set CODE=$[rand()]", call "/set_code $[rand()]".
If you want, /set_code could also gag the redef hook, or use /edit.

Let me start off by saying thanks to everyone that helped me with the
array and set problems I had. Not only did you help me solve those
problems, but you got me thinking in a whole new direction and beacuse of
it, I have expanded my SuperMacro to way beyond what I started out to do.

But I'm stuck again. :)

This is what I need. I need to define a trigger that defines a trigger.

Take a look:
/def -mregexp -p2 -F -t'You are hungry' = \
  /if (PARTAL =/ "Yes") \
    /send eat partial%;\
  /else \
    /set CASTING=Yes%;\
    /alias_food%;\
    /def -mregexp -p2 -F -n1 -t'You complete your spell' = \
      /send get ration%;\
      /send eat ration%;\
      /RestMagic%;\
  /endif%;


The problem is that I think the secon trigger is taking the endif with it.
I'm not sure though. Can anyone think of a better way to do this?

To add to my last request for help with the Trigger inside a Trigger.

I tried putting the second trigger inside $(), but that didn't work, and
also this won't work:

/def -i RestMagic = \
  /set RESTING=ON%;\
  /alias_pr%;\
  $(/def -p2 -n1 -F -mregexp -t'You complete your prayers' = \
    /set RESTING=OFF%;\
    /send look%;)

What am I doing wrong here guys?

I was wondering if there's a "programming" manual, or a large set of
example "code" someone might have compiled for TinyFugue.

I'm thinking of alot of really cool things I'd like to do with it, but I cannot
even get some of the simplest things to work. I don't think it would be
correct to post all those question here, but maybe *smile*

For example. I'd like to be able to have a "macro" be run by using the
random function as well as idle. I'd like to be able to "randomly"
run that macro anytime I've been idle between 5-25 minutes. So if my random
function falls within that range, run some macro, which all it needs to
do is "look". Be even cooler if the macro chose between a set of commands
to run, like look, search, "say hi", etc.

I also wanted to do something like, depending on which world I'm in, 
load commands from one file, instead of another. Now I know how to
use IF, THEN, ELSE, ENDIF, but I cannot seem to figure out how to get the
world name, without using the example "eval" command in the help, and when
I try to check in the IF, it's not what I wanted anyways. The variable
I'm thinking of is called "world_name". There's also some other variables
that seem to be "special" and I cannot examine or set them with the normal
set of commands.

For some reason I cannot see those special world variables without using
"eval".

But when I tried to even get the value back from idle() I didn't seem to know
how. Alot of the most usefull features of tf seem to be lacking examples
in the help *smile*.
I guess a very specific question would be, how do I get the return value
from a function back? I don't seem to be able to do that.

I'm not in front of a working tf session right now, otherwise I'd show you
some things I tried.

Thanks in advance,

 John Jamulla

oh yeah, good thing I just made one of those a few days ago... mine went
something like this:
/def idle = look%; /repeat -w -00:$[rand(5,25)] 1 /idle

did you know that /addworld lets you load up a different file for each
world? check the help on it.

>For some reason I cannot see those special world variables without using
>"eval".

that's because usually /def and other things have their own world
checkers.. with the -w option

you just have to look at the general parts.. try help functions I believe
(I didn't check that)

use $[function()]? like /eval /echo $[idle()] will spit out 0

I am, but I'm too lazy to try my own advice to see if it works. heh.

I've been meaning to get around to this for a while, and I've finally
managed to get a `finished' document ready. It's still pretty much
unchecked, but if anyone who knows what they're talking about would like to
proof-read it, this is your chance! (Or any beginner who doesn't mind taking
a few risks, I suppose ... :)

It takes you right from starting tf the first time through to reasonably
complex triggers and macros.

I can offer it in LaTeX source, DVI and PostScript; if anyone would like a
copy, email me and I'll send out a whole bunch soon. I won't post it to the

There's been a few messages about random actions lately, I thought I'd
share the method I came up with.  It takes advantage of tf's method of
calling a random trigger when they have the same text and priority.
Combine this witht the repeat command and you can have your characters
doing things, seemingly at random.

First create several triggers that do the random actions you'd like to
choose from.  Here's a quick example:

/def -t'random_bored' = stretch
/def -t'random_bored' = yawn
/def -t'random_bored' = sigh

These all have the same trigger text and are the same priority.

Next, issue a repeat command to call one of the triggers at random,
like so:

/repeat -10 99999 /if (rand(100)<25) /trigger random_bored;/endif

What this does is, every 10 seconds, there is a 25% chance that you
will perforn a random bored action.  You can adjuct the frequency and
percent chance to your likiing, depending on what you are trying to
do.  You can expand this and create other macros to set 'bored' mode,
etc.  If you are running multiple worlds at the same time, just use
the -w parameters to limit it to the specific world.

Comments and suggested enhancements would be appreciated.

Ron

Putting things in the inittab that aren't meant to be there can be very 
dangerous (i.e. a security risk).  Tf would be running as root, and it is 
generally a bad idea to run anything as root that doesn't have to be.

Seems to me that cron is better suited for this job.  Write a shell script 
that checks your ps output for the tf program.  If it's not running, start it. 
 Make the script executable and put it in your crontab.

If people want, I can post such a script to this list and specific directions 
on how to use it.

Ok... a few asked, so this is how one MIGHT run tf automagically from cron.

Type in the following script:

#!/bin/sh
if ! ps -x|grep -w tf|grep -v grep > /dev/null 2>&1
then
  exec tf < /dev/null > /dev/null
fi

Save it to a file... say we call it "check_tf".  do a chmod u+x check_tf to 
make it executable.  Then either create your self a crontab file (say called 
my_crontab) or add a line such as

	*/5 * * * * (directory where check_tf is located)/check_tf

This means check every 5 minutes.  If you want it to be more often or less 
often, change the "5" to another number.

Then do a 

	crontab my_crontab

Now... the above makes a few assumptions.

	1) You are using a BSDish unix.  If not the "ps" command may take different parameters.  Under SysVish unixes, it's probably going to be ps -e, but you should check your local man page.
	2) Your sysadmin hasn't disable cron.  A few don't run cron daemons because they feel you shouldn't be sucking processor cycles if you aren't logged in.
	3) You particular crontab file format and utilities may be different, so read the man page and double check.
	4) You tf bot requires NO input and you don't want to see any of the output.  Cron jobs are not bound to a terminal, so you can't send them input from the keyboard or read the output on your screen.  If you need to give it input or read the output you'll have to change what file is being used as input ( the file being redirected into the program with the "<" sign) and the file used as output ( the ">" redirected file )

Nonetheless, this should give you an idea of what ya need to do.  Hope this helps.

Gee, I posted just such an idler no more than a few days ago. Check
out http://www.linf.unb.br/~e8917523/btech.html, where lies a link to
my tf macros. I think that particular set of macros is an older
version. If the idler macros there do not use $(ps), then mail me and
I'll send you the newer set.

Oh, that's VERY easy. When defining a world, you say WHICH file
should be loaded when you connect!

Mumble, mumble... Grumpf... I _knew_ there were an easier way to do
it... :-)

Anyway, mine selects randomly from a pre-defined selectable set
of idle messages. :-)

The inner /def ends at the "%;" after "get ration".  "eat ration" is
part of the outer /else, not the inner /def.  When you nest evaluations
(i.e., /def or /eval), you need to use %% and $$ to produce literal %
and $ in the nested code.  Thus:

  /def -mregexp -p2 -F -t'You are hungry' = \
    /if (PARTAL =/ "Yes") \
      /send eat partial%;\
    /else \
      /set CASTING=Yes%;\
      /alias_food%;\
      /def -mregexp -p2 -F -n1 -t'You complete your spell' = \
        /send get ration%%;\
        /send eat ration%%;\
        /RestMagic%;\
    /endif%;

My wife has been bugging me to whip up a script that will log her into
each of the worlds she has defined, and then abruptly send an "@quit" to
each of them (to keep her characters active).  What is the easiest way to
do such a thing without saturating the local net connection...I can think
of a few brute force ways to do this, but nothing elegant has come to mind
that isn't horribly complex (what sprang to mind initially was a macro to
start a connection to the first world in the worlds list, send an @quit,
and wait for a disconnection.  Then, connect to the second world, etc,
etc, ad nauseum).

Help? :-)

I'm trying to get something to trigger on text from a world with a number 
in it, and do different actions depending on the number?  I don't want to 
have a different trigger for every number, I'd ratther 1 trigger that 
called a macro or evaluated the contents of a variable.

There is something else - I want to have it have a default action for 
numbers without special actions for them defined.  Thats been my main 
stumbling block.

This doesn't totally work. I'm trying to mess with it and from other messages
today I might have an idea. but the problem is it doesn't like the
$[rand(5,25)] part, wants a real number there, from the errors I got.

The following page has alot of cool stuff in it, as soon as I figure out
how it works....

ElendorMUSH has a very irritating +com system that hihglights the channel
names.  Depsite asking, begging, pleading, whining, cajoling, etc. the admins
they refuse to make this user configurable.  The repeated response is to set
my character !ansi.  Bah!  I don't want to be !ansi for the whole game just
the eye spamming +com messages.

I've tried writing a trigger to filter this out, but I've not been successful.
The channel names are in <> such as <Code>.

Can someone, please, show me how this can be done?  My thanks in advance.

Thanks. You can post any doubts from that code here on this group,
and I'll gladly answer them. Notice that not all of that code is
mine, and the code style changed according to TF's current version
features at the time each part of the code was done. :-)

Try:

/def -ag -F -mregexp -t"^<..*>.*" channels = /echo %0

I read somewhere that there's a TF command to strip ANSI codes without 
having to set yourself (MUSHly) as !ANSI.  I haven't any idea where I 
read it or what the command was...can anybody help me with this?

Thanks.

Hi, well, I was trying to make ^K and ^Y work as they do in shells and
Emacs. That is if you press ^K everything right of the cursor is saved in
a yank-buffer and when you press ^Y you paste it back in. 
But as you have figered out I didn't succsed, so I wonder if anyone has
done this or have ideas how to do it.

I have had this same problem, when connecting to a Circle-based MUD.  I
found out that if I connect to something else first(another mud, or just
plain server) then try to connect to the MUD again, it shows the status
line before I hit the enter key, as opposed to after.

Okay, I've perused the /help, and asked a few people, and cannot find the 
answer to this question, though it's surely a very simple one:

How does one generate a carriage return in a /echo? What I want to do is 
have /echo produce output like:
	1. First item in list
	2. Second item in list

Currently, I have to do it this way:
	/def msg = /echo 1. First item in list%;/echo 2. Second item in list

Is there not some shortcut to get a new line of text? It gets repetetive 
when you have longer text to /echo. :)

Try creating the text file, then using /quote

With slight modifications, kbregion.tf in the TFLIBDIR directory will do
what you want.

I don't know. I don't know how your MUD is displaying the status
line, how your TF is configured, and what seems to be the problem. I
don't even know what MUD is this so I can check it out.

In other words, you told me nothing except that you have a problem
with something you call "status line", and this problem doesn't show
up when using telnet.

The only hint I can give you is configuring the world as type
"telnet", i.e., add a -T"telnet" just after /addworld.

I am trying to get keybindings to work with a copy of NCSA telnet on my
mac, specifically to keybind the function keys on my keyboard.

when i type in F1, for example, in tf, it prints out this sequence:

[[17~

where the first bracket is hilited...if i cut and paste this string, the
binding works

is this a problem with my term program, or is there some kind of control
character i need to type in to get it to work properly?

even if i could use the F1 key as an alias name that would be useful..
i.e.
/alias [[17~ /dostuff

(i tried that, got unmatched [ error)

any suggestions for either of these questions are greatly appreciated.

also are there any more clear directions, examples on regexp matching
somewhere?

-Andrew

I would like to define a new world but can't quite figure out how to.
Currently I have it defined as a DIKU type world cause that's what it
is.
The problem is that I have to define it so that the character name is 2
and the password is the character name, then type in the password when
it's asked for. I'd like to set it up so that it does everything.
The reason I have to type in 2 is cause first prompt ask for <CR> for
ansi graphics and 1 for a generic term. Or type 2 for ansi.
Then it promts char and pwd.
There should be an easy way to define it but havn't seen any decent
examples or I'm looking in the wrong places.
Any help would be appreciated
BTW, the mud is: mud.sojourn.com 9999
Thanks.

I do the same thing, you have to type a \ character in front of every [
character, otherwise tf interprets them, and thus gives the unmached [
error (its looking for its partner, ])

Try:

/bind \[\[17~ = <action>

(assuming the key you want to bind gives out [[17~)

I often have them set to do an action of /world <world> so i can log
in/switch talkers/muds using f-keys. Ie: /bind \[\[17~ = /world tower.

When i first used tinyfugue, the person who set it up set up a bind.tf file
which contained mainly arrow key bindings, i would, if you haven't already,
create a file for these bindings, and have it defined and loaded in your
.tfrc file.

I hope that this helps.

This is going to have one very big problem; very few function keys
actually send out two '[' characters in a row.  However, a great many of
them send an escape character followed by a '['; it just so happens that
ESC looks something like '^[' or a weird '[' on most systems.

In any case, two '[' characters probably isn't going to match anything.
The fix here is to put the literal escape in; this varies according to
your editor, but in vi you go

/bind ^V^[\[17~ = <action>

(where ^V is Control-V and ^[ is ESC).

I notice, on a talker i use, that if i set it to hilite certain types of
messages (triggering on initial stuff on the line identifying the channel
they come from), if the line wraps to the next in tinyfugue, the next line
isn't hilited/gagged/whatever as i have set it to be.

I turned the linewrap on the talker off, and even tried turning it off in
tinyfuge (if i change the emulation to reduce processing on the text, the
terminal will still process it).  This wont help, only the first unwrapped
line from the talker is hilited/gagged, any subsequent are not.

I'm using 35 alpha 20 currently, is there any way tf can process the entire
message sent to me and hilite it?

this occured to me this morning as i was thinking about your problem...
it works for what i need it to, and i'm sure you can modify it to
suit your problem, the concept is easy enough.

/def -ag -t'*tells you*' = /echo -aCgreen %{*}

basically...gag the incoming stuff, then echo it in the color you want

Hi,

something for the wish list, Hawkeye:

A command history that stores every command only once even if it's
repeated many times, like some of the UNIX shells do. 

Example: I sometimes have to cast a spell several times before it works.
So my command history is full of 4 or 5 "cast 'detect invis'" in a row. 

What do you think about that?

thanks,
erik.

Define a new world-type: /def -T'ansidiku' -HLOGIN = 2 %; %2 %; %3
Then define the addworld:
/addworld -Tansidiku mymud char passwd mud.sojourn.com 9999 ~/mydir/myfile.tf

Try it...

Yes, check /help bind (and /help macros -- most problems can be
solved by a look at /help macros).

E.g.,

/def -b'^@;' f1 = .f
/def -b'^@<' f2 = .ff
/def -b'^@=' f3 = .fff
/def -b'^@>' f4 = /search
/def -b'^@?' f5 = .c
/def -b'^@@' f6 = .b
/def -b'^@A' f7 = .r
/def -b'^@B' f8 = .t
/def -b'^@C' f9 = searchlight%;.f%;searchlight
/def -b'^@^[^E' f12 = /fg ->

Hello All,

    I want to catch my prompt and grab some information from it to save to
some variables. My prompt looks like this:

(HP:500 MA:200 MV:200)>

    I want to capture the numbers in variables for use elsewhere.. At
first I tried a regexp trigger, planning on using %Pn variables to extract
the info I want, but I can't figure out how to escape the parenthesis in
my prompt. I know it must be in the manual somewhere (probably right under
my nose) but I'll be damned if I can find it..

    In summation:

    1. What would be the best way to extract the information from my
prompt?

    2. How do I escape () in a regexp?

Thanks in advance,  Charles

I'm not exactly sure what my mac gives out when i press an f-key in
tinyfugue anymore, as the telnet program i'm using wont do it any more, but
using NCSA Telnet 2.6 i very easily bound the f-keys to do useful things,
as well as the help, delete, home, end, page up and page down keys.

The problem came with versions of tf 35 after about alpha 6 or so where the
actual output of the f-key changed to include an escape character (^[ on my
terminal (SunOS 5.5)) and i only had to add a couple of things to each
binding.  FYI here is my bind.tf file.

All these are bindings for macs using NCSA Telnet 2.6 other than the EMACS
ones, which i didn't put in myself.  Note where I used /bind i had to
'quote' the [ characters like \[ but where i used /def -b i didn't have
too.

I hope someone finds this useful :)

Use a PROMPT hook.  See /help prompts, hooks.

Use "\(" and "\)".  See /help regexp.

The change (in 3.5 alpha 9) was only in the *display* of nonprintable
characters that made it to the output because they were not first
matched by a keybinding: before, they were ignored; now, they are printed
in bold reverse printable form.  It has absolutely no effect on keybindings.

If you have a key that emits "^[[17", then the correct way to bind it
in all versions since 2.1 is
  /def -b'^[[17~' name = body    (quotes are optional in this case)
or
  /bind ^[[17~ = body
This will work as expected in all versions.

But if you incorrectly bound "[17~" and then pressed that function key that
sends "^[[17~", tf interprets it as "^[" followed by the keybinding
"[17~".  pre-35a9 will not print the "^[", and 35a9 or later will print it
as bold reverse "[".

I am playing a MUSH that has a space system where you battle from 
ships. I would like to write a trigger or def that will take the 
information from the sensor scan and change the heading of my ship. 
Depending on which method you use to scan you get a  table type 
readout. The line that is significant is either:

Bearing: 180 mark 45  or
Heading: 180 mark 45

The mark number can be negative also in the form -45

The command to change direction with the ship is:
head 180 mark 45

Of course the numbers vary depending on where the other ship is.

I would appreciate any ideas on how I could set something up make it 
quicker to change ship direction. Thanks.

Ok.. How about this?

/def -mregexp -t'^(Bearing|Heading): ([0-9]+) mark (-?[0-9]+)' = \
                                                              head %P2 mark %P3

Hmm... not tested, but should work, no?

Hi.

I have a following trigger:
/def -mregexp -t"^(.*) tells you '(.*)'" treceive = !./processtell %P2

it works just like i want it..it grabs the tell text and sends it to
that processtell program. However if the tell is so long that it is
split into 2 or more lines then my trigger will bail out and not work.
I guess i should add something which would tell that linefeeds and
carriage returns are allowed, but i dunno how.

I would be so happy if someone could help me with this 

Regards,
Mika Kuoppala (miku@iki.fi)

On my local MUD I want to set up a trigger that scribes a scroll whenever
I get enough mana to make one.

My status line looks like this H:416(416) M:220(220) V:500(500)
Whenever my mana (the middle one) is above 200 I want to trigger fsc
(scribe fireball) could someone show me how to do this please?

Just out of curiosity, do most people use TF to cheat on combat muds? 
Questions like that seem to dominate the mailing list...

Anyway, if you want to trigger that any time you're within 20 of your
possible mana, use:

/def -mregexp -t'H:([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\) M:([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)
V:([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)' = /if (0+{P3} >= {P4}-20) /fsc%;/endif

[that's all one line, except to netscape...]

As you might guess, P1..P6 have all the values from that line.  If you
just want to do it anytime you're over 200 mana,

/def -mregexp -t'H:([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\) M:([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)
V:([0-9]+)\(([0-9]+)\)' = /if (0+{P3} >= 200) /fsc%;/endif

I just wanted to let people know that I wrote a few macros macros for play
on SojournMud.  Actually, they are fairly easy to adapt to any mud.  You
can download them from my home page.  Just following the link below.

Let me know what you think, and if you make any improvements or anything,
please, let me know, I'd love the help.

I know /reverse reverses strings ('bah feh' becomes 'feh bah'), but is
there a way to reverse the WHOLE thing?  Characters and all?  Ie, ('bah

And if not, can somebody tell me how to write such?

  I haven't been following along too close recently, so I apologize if
this has already come up. Is there any way we could get full VT102
terminal emulation, complete with non-scrolling regions? Some muds make
use of this for mapping purposes and/or status bars, and would be a great
thing to have. Thanks!

you could always /set emulation raw and have your terminal decide what to
do with the codes... this messes up your word wrap though, so turn it on
from the mud.
normally emulation is set to ansi_attr which just shows color codes and
nothing else.

That depends on what you call "cheating". For example, I intend to
write a btech 3056 set of macros to make an comm. officer job easier.
Is this cheating? No! All my macros are publicly available. The
purpose here is make the game more enjoyable. After all, it IS tough
to coordinate a 100+ people battle (even if you only get to hear one
of the sides).

Also, triggers such as this guy proposes only automate tactics. It
reduces the flexibility, and, if the MUD is well designed, creates
weakness that can be explored by opponents.

I'd say this is the equivalent of buying a better joystick. Sure, no
keyboard Descent player can handle a two-joysticks (and the *right*
joysticks) player, but that player isn't cheating, he's bringing the
interface reponse up to *his* level.

On a talker i use, we can make messages colorful by putting in special
codes to start and end certain colors.  IE:

^1 = red, ^2 = green....^N = no color.

If i type ^1blah^2 more^N  then i will get blah in red, and more in green.

There are 12 colors in all: ^1 -> ^6, and a second set for the non-bright
set of the above.  What i want is to send a message where either every
letter or every word is a different color.  I dont mind if they cycle
through the colors repeditively.

eg, if i type: /letter_color hello there

it would send to the talker: ^1h^2e^3l^4l^5o ^6t^1h^2e^3r^4e^N

or if i typed /word_color hello there

it would send to the talker: ^1hello ^2there^N

Is this possible?  Or should i just learn to code in C?

I am not sure if its cheating, to use TF to automate eating,drinking, etc. 
The MUD I play does prohibit robots to autoscribe(which is what started
this thread) or autopractice spells.  So i guess it depends on what you
do and where ya do it

I was just wondering if anyone can shed some light on this problem I seem 
to be having with TinyFugue.

I first started using TF 33b1 which was installed on my ISP and it ran 
fine, then about 2 months ago I start getting the message

% Connection to World closed: recv: Operation would block

It didn't happen much at first but has been getting much worse lately. 
Thinking maybe it just might be a bug in that version I installed TF 
35a20 in my personal directory and ran it, but now instead I get

% Connection to World closed: recv: Resource temporarily unavailable

just as frequently. This is getting very annoying especially when I am 
coding a large project or chatting with people ICly. My uname data is:
SunOS parka 5.5 Generic_103093-03 sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-10

Any suggestions??

Everyonce in a while, and lately, exceedingly more often, I've been 
experiencing a problem with TinyFugue. The version is 3.3b1, so it is 
rather old, but it's the version that's ran globally on my net provider, 
and I don't really have the online diskspace to set up a newer copy of 
it, and I'm not even sure if that'd solve the problem. What happens is 
that it once in a while cuts me off randomly, giving me this message:
% Connection to <host> closed: recv: Operation would block
and then it cuts me off from that host. Sometimes i'm right in the middle 
of coding something, others I'm right in the middle of Roleplaying 
something that could cost my PC its life. In any case, it's annoying. 
Anyone know what's causing this and how to fix it? Does it look like a 
problem with my ISP, or with the way the program is set up? If I got my 
ISP to upgrade to the newer version, would that fix it?

Thanx,

Its a bug in the SunOS, as far as i have been told, as i am on a computer
almost exactly the same as yours.  I cannot talk to the system admins about
it unfortunately as its a university staff account, and i would have to
tell them what i am doing, which would get the account barred.

I have had this problem with every version of tf i have used.  I am
currently using 35 alpha 20.  The message i get is the second one mentioned
above when using this version.

I also here there are patches for the telnet aspect of the OS, but i am
unsure if that included one for SunOS 5.5.

I would also be very interested if anyone knows of the way to fix this problem.

My God, I'm depressed!  Here I am, a computer with a mind a thousand
times as powerful as yours, doing nothing but cranking out fortunes and
sending mail about softball games.  And I've got this pain right
through my ALU.  I've asked for it to be replaced, but nobody ever
listens.  I think it would be better for us both if you were to just
log out again.

I have been using the stack_queue.tf library file to hold lists of items.
I would prefer to have an array (C) or record (pascal) data structure to
hold things like Skill scores and items, prices.  how can I do this?

Generate variable names on the fly, using /eval to evaluate the generated
code.  For example, the definition

    /def echo_array = \
        /let arrayname=%{1}%;\
        /let index=1%;\
        /while /test %{arrayname}__%{index} !~ ""%; /do \
            /eval /echo %%{%{arrayname}__%{index}}%;\
            /test index := index + 1%;\
        /done

will enable you to call "/echo_array inventory" to echo the values of
the variables inventory__1, inventory__2, inventory__3, etc.  This
example illustrates an open-ended array, but fixed-sized arrays and
structures can be implemented with the same technique.

Note that /test evaluates its arguments, which is why no /eval was
needed in the /while condition.  Using the abbreviated condition
syntax, it would have been necessary to /eval the entire /while
statement and escape the %'s it contains:

    /def echo_array = \
        /let arrayname=%{1}%;\
        /let index=1%;\
        /eval \
            /while (%{arrayname}__%{index} !~ "") \
                /eval /echo %%%{%%{arrayname}__%%{index}}%%;\
                /test index := index + 1%%;\
            /done

   Okay, I fiddled around a bit and got this to work a little more. The
mud in question was Aturion Dynasty (aturion.globalimage.com 4444), which
has a unique overhead mapping system which make extensive use of screen
cursor positioning. Doing a /set emulation raw _after_ logging into the
mud helped a lot. I didn't realize this would be necessary. There are
still some quirks, but I guess I will have to talk to the admin there to
determine if they are the result of the mud or TF.

Okay.  I've been banging my head against my desk here.  Why doesn't this
work:

	/def roomdesc=/quote -dsend -w @force \#5153='rooms/%0

The /quote is the part that tinyfugue is telling me is bad syntax.
Unfortunately I can't figure out *why*.  I'm using 3.5 alpha 20.  Any
help would be appreciated.  Thanks.

Is it just me or does /beep <more than 1> only emit 1 beep?
I'm running  Linux 1.2.13 and using TF from a virtual console if that 
matters.

Actually, that does matter immensely.

The reason is that the speed of the `connection' between your virtual 
console and your computer is PDF (pretty damn fast).  TF is actually 
sending multiple bells to your terminal, but they transfer so fast that 
you hear them all at the same time (effectively).

You can notice this if you pop up an xterm, create a file containing 10 
^G characters, and then cat it to the screen.  By all rights, you should 
get 10 bells, but because the connection is as fast as it is you only get 
the one.

If you were on a 110-baud Teletype going in off a phone line, you would 
definitely hear multiple bells.

	I only play on combat muds, and will use TF to its best ability
and my best ability to make the mud more enjoyable to me. If thats 
considered cheating, I'd rather play a different mud. I stress the 
word "PLAY". If some folks like to spend time eating, memorizing spells,
scribing, or sleeping, then let them. Personally, I find it a waste of my 
time. Then someone says its not roleplaying ..... well if I wanted to 
get that deep into roleplaying, I'd join one of the clubs that dress 
up and reinact acient battles. I play a game and TF allows me to enjoy it 
a bit more. Those times when I have to wait for the Mud Ticks I start 
reading the TF help files to try and enhance my game even more.
	Its not an unlevel playing field either...anyone can get a copy 
of TF (ITS FREE!!). Besides, Im a lowsy typer, if I am able to type 
out a command in combat it is usually spelled wrong :). So, what kinda 
mud do I want to play ... 90 words/minute MUD? I only get a few minutes 
of wastefull/play time as it is, I'd muther rather be playing not waiting 
to play.

I've had this sort if problem, but (IIRC) for me, it beeps once if I give
/beep (or /beep 1? I can't remember ...), but does nothing if I ask it to
beep more than once. I'm running 2.0.something (almost the latest, I think).
I've never really looked into this, though, so I can't guarantee this
information. All I could think of offhand was that it might be a termcap
problem, but this is just a wild guess. I'll look into it if I get the time.

Enjoy!

I think... a glob might be faster, but if they have more than one word in
their names will mess up..
/def -mglob -t'{*} says, "*hiya russell*"' = say hi %1

these don't match case... so like if you want to match Russell too, need to
do something like [Rr].. but you knew that, I'm sure.

This is ok for places where you know there are no other automatic greeting
scripts around.  For general use, you would have to buffer the pattern
and compare it the next time this trigger is run, in order to avoid trigger
loops like

a says: hi b
b says: hi a
a says: hi b
b says: hi a
a says: hi b
b says: hi a
a says: hi b
b says: hi a
a says: hi b
b says: hi a
a says: hi b
b says: hi a

	I started using tf a while ago and am having some problems...
1) I am trying to match something like: [ INFO ] Jane has leveled!!!!!!
i have tried such things as:
/def -mregexp -p1 -t"[ INFO ] ([A-Z][a-z]+) has LEVELED!!!!!!" leveled = \
so that it will match a capital letter and then any number of lower case letters
to be as specific as possible, but this does not seem to work...
Also how does tf treat color codes? this is displayed in bold, if i put a 
-t"^[ INFO ]... would there be no chance of it matching it? So how would i match
how i want it to?

2) I am tring to have certain groups of words highlighted in the middle of a
line but it highlights the whole line instead. Here is one example of a try:
/def -mregexp -p10 -F -aCred -t"BLEEDING!"
Am i going to have to use /partial? and how exactly would i do it?

3) To match a number in regexps, would you use ([0-9]+) or [0-9]+ or neither?
maybe im just doing something else wrong, put %p1 seems to evaluate to nothing
when i do:
/def -mregexp -p2 -t"Geofrec the Armorer tells you, 'Here, you can have [0-9]+ 
                     coins for that.'$" sold_armor = deposit %{P1}
(The actual /def is all on the same line...)

Thats all i can think of for now... But I know i had more :)

tf doesn't care about what color things are when it's matching, it just
matches the text. You're having problems because the [ and ] characters are
part of what you're trying to match, and they're part of the regexp codes.
You need to escape them with \, so use \[ INFO \]....

yeah.. /partial works, but if you're planning on using specific colors you
need to use the /def form..
/def -mregexp -p10 -F -PCred -t"BLEEDING!"

either works, but if you plan on using it on %p1, etc you need to have the
parentheses around it.

tf has beaten me.

I have a trigger that starts up a log file on receiving:
***BEGIN

and closes the log on:
***END

Everything works dandy, but those two lines are at the top and the 
bottom of the log file.  I've tried what I know to keep them out,
but I'm not hitting on the correct way...anyone know?


Thanks,
Joel..

Ok, I have a minor (hopefully) problem with a trigger that I can't seem
to resolve.

What I have is a set of triggers and a macro to collect coins from
kills, count what I've collected, then when ready /share will split all
those coins with the group I'm in.

The line where you collect coins looks like this:

There were: 17 platinum coins, 42 gold coins, 16 silver coins, 42 copper
coins.

However if there are no coins of a specific denomination that part is
left out like:

There were: 12 gold coins, and 15 copper coins. This is where I have
trouble. Currently my triggers look like this:

(since Platinum will always be first)
/def -mregexp -p1 -F -t"^There were: (.*) platinum (.*)$" plats = /set
PLAT=$[%P1+%PLAT]

Then the others:
/def -mregexp -p1 -F -t"^There were: (.*) ([0-9]+) gold (.*)$" golds =
/set GOLD=$[%P2+%GOLD]
/def -mregexp -p1 -F -t"^There were: (.*) ([0-9]+) silver (.*)$" silvers
= /set SILVER=$[%P2+%SILVER]
/def -mregexp -p1 -F -t"^There were: (.*) ([0-9]+) copper (.*)$" coppers
= drop %P2 c

Then the macro:
/def share = split %PLAT p%;split %GOLD g%;split %SILVER s%;/unset
PLAT%;/unset GOLD%;/unset SILVER

It works great and counts up the coins perfectly except when gold or
silver or copper comes first.
Evidentally if there is nothing between the $$ amount and the THERE
WERE:  then it misses counting the nothing as a %P1

I have thought of other ways to check the string for 'gold', 'silver',
and 'copper' then set the variables using the position, etc, but that
gets kinda complex and I'd like to keep it as simple as posssible.

The only other thing I can think of is to add 3 more triggers to count
the gold, silver, copper if it appears first in the list like:
/def -mregexp -p1 -F -t"^There were: ([0-9]+) gold (.*)$" golds = etc...

This may be the simplest way out but I was hoping there may be something
easier to work with the %Pn substitution.

Any ideas?

	Two choices:

/def -mregexp -p1 -F -t'^There were: ([0-9]+) platinum coins' plats =\
    /set PLAT=$[%P1+%PLAT]
/def -mregexp -p1 -F -t'There were:.* ([0-9+) gold coins' golds =\
    /set GOLD=$[%P1+%GOLD]
ETC...

	or:

/def -mregexp -p1 -t'^There were:( ([0-9]+) platinum coins[,.])?( ([0-9]+) gold coins[,.])?( ([0-9]+) silver coins[,.])?( ([0-9]+) copper coins[,.])?' =\
    /set PLAT=$[%P2+%PLAT]%;\
    /set GOLD=$[%P4+%GOLD]%;\
    /set SILVER=$[%P6+%SILVER]%;\
    drop %p8 c

Basically your problem was that you required two spaces after the ':' if
platinum wasn't first.

Dear List Users,

	This coming weekend I will be converting all lists at tcp.com to
restricted posting.  This means you will be able to post only if your 
e-mail address matches EXACTLY the one you subscribed with.

	Here are some common reasons that might prevent you from posting:

	1) You moved your account and turned on forwarding at your old
address without changing your address on the list.

	2) Your sysadmin made changes to your site's mailer that changed 
your address.

	3) You get a different e-mail address depending on which system 
you happen to be using (such as in a public lab).

	4) You are such a power user that you have several e-mail 
addresses and post from whichever is handy.

	If you post to lists here, you might want to take a few minutes to
check your address.  The easiest way to check is to send the command
"which" to Majordomo@tcp.com in the message.  If it replies with a list of
the mailing lists you are on, you're all set.  If it doesn't your address
is different than you subscribed with.  Please unsubscribe your old 
address and subscribe with your new one.  You can find your old address 
by consulting the welcome message you received when you subscribed.

	The reason for this change is that the mailing lists are 
increasingly being targeted for unsolicited junk mail.  Increasing the 
qualifications for posting should block most such mail and make the lists 
more enjoyable.

ok, I have a friend that I'm trying to help set  up in tf. His account is
on my localhost. We tried uploading and compiling but he doesn't have
enough space for the compiling process..... I tried just pulling over my
executable but it wants to load things from my tf-lib and not his....
1. is there any way to fix the place it looks for tf-lib and such without
compiling it in the right place?
2. is there any other way for me to do this besides having him
delete/compress half his stuff for long enough to compile tf in his
account?

Set the var TFLIBDIR to the dir you want tf to find files like tf-help,
stdlib.tf, etc
To set TFLIBDIR, just add to your friend's .tfrc file the line
/set TFLIBDIR=<dir you want>

if you need any more help, try /help TFLIBDIR

Yes; you can set the environment variable TFLIBDIR to the correct directory.
For example, under the Bourne shell or derivatives you would type
$ TFLIBDIR=~/tf-lib
$ export TFLIBDIR
or under the C shell you (might; I'm not quite sure) type
% setenv TFLIBDIR ~/tf-lib

Presumably, you have space in your account; you could compile it in your
account with the correct library directories etc for his ... if by 'my
localhost' you mean you admin that computer, you could also install it
centrally (which would seem to make sense anyway); I have a set of macros
which allow each user to have their own library directories in addition to
the global one, which can be used by /load etc, if he likes to keep his own
macro files. I would post it here, but I don't have it handy; I'll try to
dig it out from somewhere.

thanks to all, especially thanks to the very helpful people who explained
how to compile from /tmp... as usual temporary space is much easier to 
deal with in unix than one would expect having formerly used systems 
like IBM/VM (bleah bleah choke wheeze :)

thanks much all again

I'm trying to install tinyfugue for the first time.  I managed to ftp the 
file to my account and there seems to be enough room for it as well.  I 
have uncompiled it and removed the .tar as well.  My instructions said to 
then enter the tinyfugue directory and "make".  I have tried this and 
could not get it to do the final install.  I'm not very good with 
UNIX...and could use a helping hand.  I'd really like to get TF installed 
in the next day or two.

Thanks!

Try typing 'unixmake' instead, or ./unixmake in the tf directory.

It might also help, if you have any more problems, also inscluding the
version of tinyfugue you downloaded, and the system you are running it on
:)

I used to use Version 3.4 alpha 16

I downloaded the most recent version (tf-35a20.tar)
when i do  a /version it says
Version 3.0 beta 1

my problem is thus.....

if i turn on ansi color on my mud
TF seems to count the ansi color codes as part of the character count for
determining when to wrap the line

so that if a line has color in it...it wraps in the middle of the line...

it is so annoying i have had to turn color off....


can somebody suggest what i should do?

Yep, looks my isp had an old version of TF in /local/usr

so now i am using the new version...and the color wrap problem has gone away...
HURRAY!

but i have got a new problem


I use a telnet client to connect to my isp which is a unix machine and i
run TF there....

my telnet client has nifty fully programmable key macros and i use the key
macros to send multiple commands to tf with one keystroke.....
only now with the new version....tf seems to pause between each command if
it is to be sent to the mud....and waits for a RETURN between each command
if the multiple commands are TF commands

the telnet program is DATA COMMET

any ideas.....

under the old version i have been using..the key macros worked fine,
sending multiple commands to TF...
and i have gotten hooked on it...i dont want to give it...

thanks!

	Yes, I've noticed this bug myself.

	Anyways, just write a tf macro to send the multiple lines to the
mud.  And have your key macro just execute one tf macro.  Or get rid of
the key macros entirely and use keybindings in tf.

Hi, all!

I'm having some compilation problems. At the start, as it seems to be.
If anyone can figure them out, I'd more than appreciate their help.

The version I was trying to compile is 3.5 alpha 20.

The UNIX version of my system is (as returned by the uname -a command):

SunOS madrid 5.5.1 Generic sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-10

The Build.log file follows after this line:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuring TinyFugue version 3.5 alpha 20

This is an alpha version, and so may not be fully tested on some platforms.
With the new features comes the possibility of new bugs.  If you don't want
to deal with this, get the latest beta version.

TF binary will be installed as     /home/math/leokor/tf
Library, help, and utilities:      /home/math/leokor/tf-lib/
Default mail directory:            /var/mail/
Man page will not be installed.

To change these locations type "n" now and edit the unix/Config file.
Continue? (y/n)


Will compile with: gcc -O
Preprocessor: gcc -O -E
Ah ha, gcc is GNU C.
Right on, your system is POSIX.

	Ok here are a couple more questions for the list...

1) if i do /for i 1 4 cc lightn   it will cast cure critic (cc alias defined
elsewhere) on me 4 times, but if a do a /alias 1 /for i 1 4 cc lightn
it will send something to the mud which responds in a Huh?!? responce, then
it will cast the 4 spells... This is only a small annoyance, but any idea why
this is happening?

2) Im a little unclear on the purpose of priorities... I know that if you have
multiple triggers that would match the same line, you could use them there, but
i cant imagine speed is much of a factor unless you have a very large script.
Would you use it to help tf, by makeing the more commonly matched triggers 
higher priority?

3) I am having some problems with this certain trigger, i get an error like:
conditional expression error: expected ')' found '%'
whenever it triggers... here it is:
/def -mregexp -p1 -t"^\[ INFO \] ([A-Z][a-z]+) has LEVELED!!!!!!$" leveled =\
        /if (%{P1}%{P2} !~ "Lightn") \
                /let t=$[rand(1, 5)] %;\
                /wait $[rand(5, 10)] \
                /if (%{t} == 1) grats Way to go %{P1}%{P2}! %;\
                        /elseif (%{t} == 2) grats Alright %{P1}%{P2}!! %;\
                        /elseif (%{t} == 3) grats Go %{P1}%{P2}! %;\
                        /elseif (%{t} == 4) grats Good Job %{P1}%{P2}! %;\
                        /else grats %{P1}%{P2}!! %;\
                /endif %;\
        /endif
It is suppose to be an auto-grats system that doesnt look like one :)
But im at a loss as to what the problem is...

Im also having some problems with prompting, and ill post those questions after
i try a few more things :)

	It works correctly for me in 3.5 alpha 18.  Note that '/for'
has had problems in the past, although I'm not sure if they were
corrected or not.  For example, it'll blow up nicely if 'i' exists as a
global variable.  And some older versions of tf would accidently make a
global variable named 'i' in certain routines.

	Which version of tf are you using?  And what does '/list -i for'
show?

	They are good for both of these reasons.  If you have a lot of
triggers, and feel that the trigger matching is slow, it can made to go
faster by sorting the more common triggers to have a higher priority.
Note also that -mregexp triggers are slower to match than -mglob
triggers.


	When I was on a very slow machine, I noticed a definite speedup
by sorting the triggers.  Today on a medium speed machine, I don't
notice any matching speed problems.  Although I currently only have 76
triggers.

	You probably don't want those %'s inside of the if () check,
because if () already does that.  Also, only have one set of ()'s in the
regexp, so P2 is empty.

	I also have no idea what /wait is, but you didn't put a %; after
it.  If it is a macro which executes the rest of it's arguments after
the time period (ie. /wait TIME STUFF...), then you need to double the
nested %'s.  I'll assume this is what it is, although it seems a bit
strange:

/def wait = /repeat -%1 1 %-1

/def -mregexp -p1 -t"^\[ INFO \] ([A-Z][a-z]+) has LEVELED!!!!!!$" leveled =\
    /if ({P1} !~ "Lightn") \
	/let t=$[rand(1, 5)]%;\
	/wait $[rand(5, 10)]\
	    /if (%t == 1) grats Way to go %{P1}!%%;\
	    /elseif (%t == 2) grats Alright %{P1}!!%%;\
	    /elseif (%t == 3) grats Go %{P1}!%%;\
	    /elseif (%t == 4) grats Good Job %{P1}!%%;\
	    /else grats %{P1}!!%%;\
	    /endif%;\
    /endif

Note that I didn't double % the P1's and that I didn't follow the rule
above about not needing the % in the if.  WHY?  Because with your /wait
(/repeat), the local variables t and P1 will be gone before the macro
runs, so we substitute the values in now ahead of time.  Currently
you're safe with the regexp you use for names, but if you let people
have names like '%;/quit' they'd be able to control your tf, by setting
to a tricky name and leveling.

	You might just want to do:

/def -mregexp -p1 -t"^\[ INFO \] ([A-Z][a-z]+) has LEVELED!!!!!!$" leveled =\
    /if ({P1} !~ "Lightn") \
	/let t=$[rand(1, 5)]%;\
	/let w=$[rand(5, 10)]%;\
	/if (t == 1) /wait %w grats Way to go %{P1}!%%;\
	/elseif (t == 2) /wait %w grats Alright %{P1}!!%%;\
	/elseif (t == 3) /wait %w grats Go %{P1}!%%;\
	/elseif (t == 4) /wait %w grats Good Job %{P1}!%%;\
	/else /wait %w grats %{P1}!!%%;\
	/endif%;\
    /endif

And make sure your /wait is defined safely as:

/def wait = /repeat -%1 1 $(/escape \\% %-1)

	The problem i was having with the /alias 1 /for i 1 4 cc lightn thing
seems to extended much further than that, even a /alias 1 cc lightn%%;cc lightn
will cause the problem... Im running 3.5 alpha 20, with /sub full, and
/list -i for displays this:
% 18: /def -i for = /@eval /let %1=%2%%; /while ( %1 <= %3 ) %-3%%; /test %1:=
%1 + 1%%; /done
Im starting to think /sub full is causing these problems, but i havent been
able to test that theory or the fixed-up autograts trigger, but thanks for the
help on that...

Also prompting is kind of being strange to me, i want to be able to take what
data is in the prompt (hp, mana, move...) and store it in variables and the
like.  But my trigger does not seem to work, and hooks dont seem to like
-mregexp... I assume my trigger is setup correctly but just to be sure, here it
is:
/def -mregexp -i -F -p50 -t"^| ([0-9]+)H ([0-9]+)E ([0-9]+)V .*> " catch_prompt
and a normal prompt looks like:
| 819H 575E 127V >
the .* is there because in a fight there are statuses of you the tank and the
enemy...  The -p50 is there because i have -p100 highlight triggers (which
currently dont highlight inside the prompt until more text arrives...)
Would gagging -h"PROMPT *" fix this, or something stranger?

One last thing, for some reason, lines will arrive on the same line as the
prompt, like room names, you are hungry mesages and stuff, which causes matching
to mess up which are suppose to match a begging of a line... could this be fixed
be changing the prompt_usec variable?

Sorry if Im asking questions to hastely without tinkering...
But if you have any ideas on these problems, help will be much appreciated :)

	Well I don't see a problem with /sub full in 35a18 using the
same /for definition.  So no help there. :)

	You are going to have to use a prompt hook to do this.  Triggers
aren't called on the partial line.  You should be able to say:

-mregexp -F -p50 -h"PROMPT ^\| ([0-9]+)H ([0-9]+)E ([0-9]+)V [^>]*> "

Note that I stuck a \ in front of the |.  Otherwise you are asking it to
match any line, since all lines have a beginning.  The | is a regexp
'or' operator.  I use -mregexp in hooks often, so that's probably not
the problem.  I've also changed your .* to [^>]*, so tf can tell more
rapidly when it's matched the entire prompt.  If your attack mode has >
in it, you'd have to clean up the regexp.

	I don't use prompts, but as I recall, if you get your prompt
hook working correctly tf will use that instead of needing to timeout
with the prompt_usec variable.  I'd work on getting the regexp to
properly match your prompt.  If you can't, try lowering prompt_usec.

I had this problem too, it's not the command as such, but the name of the
alias. Alias are done by creating a send-hook. So you send the "1", and
a send-hook catches it before it is sent to the mud and replaces it by
the true commands.

I think you are using speedwalk or map or something like this. They have
a send hook for numbers, catching them, trying to perform their tasks,
and if they see it's not part of their special task to catch this special
number, they send it to the mud via /send.

So what you do is
- send "1" to the mud (with this send hook from speedwalk or map or whatever),
  that's the "Huh?!?"
- send the commands asigned to the alias, that's the spells.

I decided that for me the numbers for alias are important, so I do not use
map and speedwalk any more ...


Hope I could help,

          Susan Dittmar

Hello,

I"ve seen this done with Zmud and other clients like that, but have
never seen it anywhere on how to do it with TinyFugue.

What I want ot do, is when I go AFk set it up so that everypage I get
is logged, and it pages hte person who paged me with 
	* pages: * received your page at <date/time stamp> and your page
has been logged, while he is AFK.

Can anyone help me out?

THank you,
Jason

I have no idea what going AFK means, but this is the general idea:

/addworld page_world_
/histsize -wpage_world_ 10

;; Stick in the location you want your pages logged to.
/log -wpage_world_ ~/FILENAME

;; You'll want to make sure this matches whatever page format you use.
/def go_afk =\
    /def -F -t'{*} pages: *' store_pages =\
	/echo -wpage_world %%*%%;\
	page \%1 = I received your page at \$[ftime("\%a \%m/\%d \%I:\%M \%p", time())], and your page has been logged while I'm AFK.

/def ungo_afk =\
    /undef store_pages


You can change the arg to ftime to be whatever time format you want.
See /help ftime().  Or 'man strftime' under unix.


non-tested code, but looks ok. ;-)

don't currently have it setup, but will soon.

Hi, all!

This is another attepmt to have my question answered.

I'm having some compilation problems. At the start, as it seems to be.
If anyone can figure them out, I'd more than appreciate their help.

The version I was trying to compile is 3.5 alpha 20.

The UNIX version of my system is (as returned by the uname -a command):

SunOS madrid 5.5.1 Generic sun4m sparc SUNW,SPARCstation-10

The Build.log file follows after this line:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuring TinyFugue version 3.5 alpha 20

This is an alpha version, and so may not be fully tested on some platforms.
With the new features comes the possibility of new bugs.  If you don't want
to deal with this, get the latest beta version.

TF binary will be installed as     /home/math/leokor/tf
Library, help, and utilities:      /home/math/leokor/tf-lib/
Default mail directory:            /var/mail/
Man page will not be installed.

To change these locations type "n" now and edit the unix/Config file.
Continue? (y/n)


Will compile with: gcc -O
Preprocessor: gcc -O -E
Ah ha, gcc is GNU C.
Right on, your system is POSIX.
Found <stdlib.h>.
Found <string.h>.
Found <memory.h>.
Found <sys/select.h>.
Found <locale.h>.
Found <netinet/in.h>.
Found <arpa/inet.h>.

   And I will say, be careful with something like this.  It would be far 
too easy to get a loop set up if someone else has a similar trigger.  All 
it would take is for one person to forget they had it on, page someone 
and get the auto-reply back...

I would like to set my type for my world to the correct type for
pennmush
The way that mush logs in is:
connect <name> <password>

my addworld is
/addworld -T'tiny' soncrest <name> <password> soncrest.giant.net 7777

and that just trys to log in 25 times before it gets it right.
 
I am kind of new to mushing and to tinyfugue (both the list and the
actually program) so I would like any help you can give me.

Brian

I am trying to write a /def or macro that will speed up my navigation
in space on a MUSH I am playing. The function on the MUSH that gives
you your heading and mark is:
think[xyang(x1,y1,x2,y2)]  for heading
think[zang(x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2)] for mark

Think is equavalent to @pemit.
The x1,y1 etc are coordinates which can be either positive or negative.
Positive is inferred the negative is in the form -100 etc.
I would like to write a /def or macro where I could just type in the
coordinates and have tinyfugue send the above functions to the MUSH.
I seem to be having a problem because of the negative numbers and the
comma seperated numbers. Any ideas on how to set this up?

A friend of mine had asked me to help him with a trigger, relatively
simple, yet it went into an infinite loop.
He wanted to cast a spell called 'barkshield' on whoever sent him the
keyword. He has a macro defined as /bark  so that when he does
/bark Bob    he would send    cast 'bark' bob
He would receive on his end:
Bob tells you 'xyzzy'

The trigger seemed simple enough, however he wanted to use mglob and not
mregexp so I told him:
/def -p1 -t"*tells you \'xyzzy\'" barker = /bark %1

well, first of all when you define a macro and state the backslash it
strangely put in it's own backslashes as well so that when you did
/list barker
you would see:
/def -p1 -t'*tells you \\\'xyzzy\\\'' barker = /bark %1
so I suggested don't put the backslashes in.
that seemed to work cause tf put in a set of backslashes:
/def -p1 -t'*tells you \'xyzzy\'' barker = /bark %1
however it didn't work.  So I suggested to remove the last '
/def -p1 -t"*tells you 'xyzzy" barker = /bark %1
this caused tf to go into an infinite loop, trying to cast bark on
someone who wasn't there.  The current version we use is 3.5 alpha 16 (I
think that's it )

ANy ideas?

I use the -T"tiny.mush" option, and that has worked for PennMUSH, 
TinyMUSH, TinyMUX, and probably all of their variants, as far as I know.  
You might want to try logging in using your @alias instead of your name.

	I'm trying to set up a trigger that sends the mud/mush/muck/etc.
a command with the value of a variable. I couldn't figure out how to do this
through the help.  Here's an example:

Hitting alt-f would send the command eat <whatever is in the food variable>

/def -ib'^[f' = /send eat %{food}

Obviously this doesn't work because it sends %{food} instead of the string
located in the "food" variable.  Can someone give me an example of how to do
this the "right way"?  Thanks,

    -Scott (who will figure out all the nuances of this stuff eventually)

you don't need to escape 's if you are using "s around the trigger, and
likewise you don't need to escape "s when you are using 's.

so just try: -t"*tells you 'xyzzy'"

Hi Scott!

/def -ib'^[f' = /eval /send eat %{food}

Remember that Windows likes to hog the Alt key.  Also remember that you
need to /set food=something  because it must be global.
Hope that helps!

Perhaps it is because I am using an older version, but part of the dirs for 
using map.tf aren't at the top of the file. Specifically, /mark starts me 
off fine, and when I want to /savepath, I think it is /savepath <name>..
but then comes the important part, saving the path to a .tf file that I 
can later load..I thought it was something like /save -a <name of path> 
-i <name of path.tf>, but for some reason it isn't saving the path like 
it used to, so i have forgotten something :) Help?
Thanks,
Talia

Maybe you want something like /save?
/savepath some-name
/save some-name-map.tf name_of_macro 

eg:
<blah>
/savepath jeff
/save jeff.tf jeff

No..I pretty much remember the format, i am just not doing it exactly right.
after /mark 'ing the path, you did /savepath <name>, then the tricky part :)
it was something like /save -a <name> -i <name.tf>
The put a file in your root dor named <name.tf>, which you could add to your
.tfrc to /load <name.tf>

Someone I was grouped with th' other day had an "autotrack" set up.  It
tracks someone, moves in the direction indicated, and tracks again, until
it reaches said someone.  The person I was with uses TinTin, tho.  Does
anybody know how I could use that in TF?  The message you get with track

Where (.*) is one of: nwest, neast, swest, seast, north, west, east,
south.

Again, I realize a lot of you know that, but.  So, can anybody help me?

/def -mregexp -t'^You sense a trail (.*) from here!$' = %P1

This assumes the all of those possible directions are valid movement
commands as well.  Also, it may be more efficient to use a different
regexp or possible simpler matching, I'll leave that to others who know
the internals better.

Hi, I'm having a healer standing on a mud to help players, but I would
like to keep track on how many times each player has used it.

So, I wrote a macro that looks like this:

/def -p2 -F -mregexp -t'([a-zA-Z]+) tells you: undamage' = /if (%up >= 40)
undamage %P1 %; /set up=$[up-40] %; /set %P1=$[%P1+1] %; /else tell %P1
out of usage pool, try again in a short while. %; /endif %; /set %P1

and was hoping that the /set %P1=$[%P1+1] statement would add +1 to a  
variable with the players name.

%Bop = 0

Bop tells you: undamage

%Bop = 1

Bop tells you: undamage

%Bop = 2
.
.
.

anyone got any sugestions on how to do this?

For some reason, /lodaworld is redefining the last world in my tiny.world.
And I know it's the last world, and not a world I've got in there twice,
be cause it's been EN, WM, LM, and AO, whichever was on the bottom line of
tiny.world.  It's fairly annoying, tho it doesn't really hurt anything.
And ideas?

it depends on what key sequence gives out... I know f1 gives /help on mine
so I looked up the macro for it..

 /def -i -b'^[OP' = /help

pressing the f2,f3 keys gives [OQ, [OR etc... so you could probably bind
them similarly.

You had best sort it out yourself, since it depends on the system you are
using.

So F1 can be either ^[[[A (eg Linux), ^[[M (eg FreeBSD), ^[OP (eg SunOS),
^[[11~ (eg DOS). In most cases F2-F4 are defined "following" F1, but
F5-F10 and F11, F12 are usually completely different.

On most systems, typing Ctrl-V followed by the function key, will show
the escape code for this key.

You can set up your bindings like

/def -b^[[[A F1 = code for F1 key binding.

Johan.

P.S. Do not define keybindings F1-F12 for all systems at the same time:
	they can - and usually will - clash.

Easiest way is to do two things:

Read /help bind

Press each f-key and write down what comes up in tinyfugue when you press
it, and use that with /bind.  If nothing comes up, then that means two
things: The key is either already bound or has something to do with the
terminal (like arrow keys and pageup/pagedown which are essentially f-keys
on macs).  If something does come up, then you can bind to that.  If one of
the characters is an inverse [ symbol (ie white on black on a black
text/white background terminal), just replace it with ^[ and that should
work (at least it does on my system).

The following is what I use.. it strips the first letter of the direction

it to work for you. Have fun!

One MUD I play on has a monster that, if beaten, poisons your drinks in
the pub.  I want to make a hook that will interrupt when I send lines of
text with the word 'buy beer' in it.  What I want is instead of the
command 'buy beer' being sent to the socket, I want tf to catch it and

  /echo Dont buy beer, Joe poisoned it 

instead.

I tried this:
/def -mregexp -h'SEND .*buy beer.*'

Help?

	Either of these should work (and both do in tf35a18), although
the regexp version is case sensitive.  I believe in some older tf's you
needed to say -ag on a send hook, otherwise it'd still send the line.
You might try that.  Also if the 'buy beer' is being sent to the mud by
an explicit /send in another macro, the hook won't run.

Ok, i dont quite understand how /eval works. lets take this piece of code:
/set id=0
/def addtarg=/eval /set tg%id=%1%;/set id=$[id+1]
/def ltargs=/echo *** targets *** %; \
            /set idd=0%;\
            /for i 0 $[id-1] \
              /set idd=%%i%%;\
              /echo Target %%{idd} is  %%{$(/eval /echo tg%%{idd})}%;
It is a thing used to keep a list of targets. /addtarg define a new target, 
putting it in tg0 , tg1 etc...
Then when i want to list all the targets, i use /ltargs.

Somehow, the /eval inside %%{$/eval /echo tg%%{idd})} is evaluated only ONCE at 
the start of the loop..

Here is the echo:
here tg0 and tg1 are set with /addtarg. everything is fine..
+ /eval /set tg0=jack
+++ /set tg0=jack
++ /set id=1
++ /eval /set tg1=john
+++ /set tg1=john
++ /set id=2

here i start /ltargs 

++ /echo *** targets ***
*** targets ***
++ /set idd=0
+++ /eval /echo tg%{idd}   
+++ /echo tg0                      <----- EVALUATED ONLY ONCE !
++ /for i 0 1 /set idd=%i%;/echo Target %{idd} is  %{tg0}   
Target 0 is  jack
Target 1 is  jack

Why is /eval behaving like that and how can i force a new eval each time ?

	You have a couple problems.  The /for is going to cause some
tricks, just because you really have to think about all of the double
quoting inside.

	The $(/eval /echo tg%{x}) is the same as $(/echo tg%{x}).  What
you want to do is move the /eval out a lot.  Using /eval basically tells
tf to do another set of % and $ expansions.  So to look at %{tg%{id}}
(which is what you want to get to).  You can do something like:

/def foo=\
    /eval /echo %%{tg%{idd}}

When you type /foo, % and $ subs are filled in.  (assuming idd is 1)
/eval /echo %{tg1}

Then the /eval goes and does another set of % and $ subs:
(assuming tg1 = 10)
/echo 10


So in your example, you'd be wanting to do something more like:
/eval /echo Target %%{idd} is %%{tg%{idd}}

Note that I use double %'s on the first idd.  Since we know idd is just
a number (in this case) it's not too big of a deal.  However, if idd was
a string that had some '%'s in it itself then you don't want to eval
that stuff.  Make sense?


Your addtarg macro doesn't need a /eval at all, so don't use it.  About
the only time you ever need to use /eval is when you are doing
''double-variable'' kinds of things.

I'm not sure why you use idd in your ltargs macro at all, so I'm going
to take it out, and use the 'i' of the for loop.

/set id=0
/def addtarg =\
    /set tg%{id}=%1%;\
    /set id=$[id+1]

/def ltargs=\
    /echo *** targets ***%;\
    /for i 0 $[id-1] \
        /eval /echo Target %%%{i} is  %%%{tg%%{i}}

Note the extra set of %'s in the /for just because /for is actually a
macro, not a builtin command (/list -i for).

Ok, got a couple of questions about prompts that I hope someone can
answer...

1. I've setup a macro to catch my prompt 
(/def -h"PROMPT *> " catch_prompt = /prompt %*) but when it displays it's
always highlighted instead of the colors the MUD sends out (the mud is
Dark Realms ftoomsh.progsoc.uts.edu.au 5000) how can I fix my prompt so
the colors are normal? (when you have over 60% of ur stats is shows up as
green numbers, under %60 is yellow, & under 30% is red).

2. I want to setup a bot to scribe fireball whenever I have enough
mana(over 150), I've been told how to do this before...but I ALSO want to
vitilize my mana when it gets below 100 points. I would do this by casting
a spell called 'vitilize mana'. I would need over 50 hitpoints to convert
to mana.
The prompt looks like this: H:448*(493) M:239*(314) V:227*(307) *>

This may seem a simple question, but i simply cannot figure it out...can
someone help?

I want to match a person's name in this:

=*[mindscape]*= <name>: message

there is also another form of this channel:

=*[mindscape]*= <name> emote

I want a trigger that will match the first, _not_ the second, so that
someone cant confuse the robot i'm making by putting a : after a word in
the second message.  In other words, the <name> must not have spaces in it.

I cant figure out how to do this using regexp, or glob, as i cant use {*}
because of the : after the name.  I tried [^ ]+ but that wont work either
(with regexp).

To put things even more simply, i want to know how to match one variable
name/word, which includes mixes of capital and lowercase letters.

Am I missing something obvious?

I'm using tf-35alpha 20 by the way.

	[^ ]+ does work for what you want.

HI..never did get an answer on the exact last step to save a mapped path 
to a <pathname.tf> file. I have a ton of them done..the format created 
uses /dopath, but like I said before, 
1. /mark  
2./savepath <pathname>
3. /save -a <pathname> -i <pathname.tf>

My problem is in step 3. It used to produce a file named <pathname.tf> 
with a /dopath format. Can anyone remember how to do the last step right, 
or spot where I am making my mistake?

And number 2..somene asked how you can gag/hide the %trigger in world blah
from showing up on the screen and Ken answered with a real simple /def, 
but I lost it. Someone else had said using a highlight /def :) that 
highlighted it beautifully..not what I was looking for :) Danke for the help

Hello,

I've looked at the help on bindings and such but I can't seem to find
a way to send specific control sequences to the the world.

The main ones I'd like to be able to send are ^C and ^].
^C already has a function internal to tf, but there must be a way I
could /def ctrl-c = (whatever) and have it output a ^C in the world.
As for ^], it is unbound, yet when I use it all I get is a highligthed
"]" character on my screen.

Scott,
with an implied "any ideas?"  :)

I don't know the solution for your ^C problem, but this one's easy, say 
you wanted to send a ^]z to suspend a telnet session. Then you can just 
type ^]z (Where the ^] will get highlighted) and hit enter, and it will 
be sent. For as far as I know this is the case with all nonbound control 
keys, they appear highlighted on the screen, and are just sent as control 
character when you hit return.

Mad.

Dear Jeff, 
The above takes care of the mssg Activity on World blah, but not the mssg 
'%trigger on world blah'(least I don't think so). So far, the way Ken 
said to do it was /def -q -h, I think. Unfortunately, I use a systemwide 
version of tf..and have writen many times asking that it be updated. In 
the version I have available, /def -q -h  gives 'q is not an option. So I 
may not be able to fix this at all :( But I do thank you for trying.

Actually. ^V is the character you use to send literal control codes.
If you're on a unix shell, you can echo beeps with echo ^V^G, so I 
presume it isn't a tf feature, and thus might not work in for example the 
OS2 version. I'm not sure about that, though. In the same way, you could 
send a tab as ^V^I.

(Tested in all tf's I have under unix, still need to compile the OS2 one, 
so if someone could say something about that?)

Mad.

Ok, I have a few questions here that I'm sure someone will be able to
help.

Suppose I want to set a variable and use it in a trigger like:

/set LEADER=Larry

then in the trigger I want it to activate when larry does something
like:

/def -mregexp -t"^%LEADER says \'mental (.*)\'$" mental = /of %P1

(fyi, /of = order follower %* )

so if I would get the line:

Larry says 'mental enter ship'

it should send /of enter ship

But it doesn't work because I think I don't understand the variable
substitution within a string.

Should it have an extra % in front like %%LEADER ??


Also, could someone plz explain when it is necessary to put an extra %
and one more thing...
what is the difference between %LEADER and %{LEADER} ??
when do you use braces and when do you not use them?
Same goes for parenthesis...when do you use them and when do you use
braces like:
(go|went|gone)  vs  {go|went|gone}
etc.
These are just a few questions I have that have been bugging me for
quite some time and I can't seem to find much detailed help on this in
the docs.
Thanks to whoever can help.

Whee! The person in charge of tf for netcom just mailed that he tried to 
update tf, but the glia address, the last he has, would not respond. So!
Here is a REAL simple question...one I should know the answer to *blush*
Please...what is the address where the latest version of tf can be found?

Okay.  This is a fairly simple problem:  I want tf to watch for a
specific name, and replace it with another name without altering
anything else about it.  I was thinking about a /gag, or a /gag + a
/trigger.  Anyone got any good ideas?

But you should not use or advertise the laurel address.  Use

/dokey LNEXT (default ^V) is a tf feature, chosen to follow unix
conventions.  It will work to quote (avoid interpreting) the next
chracter received by tf.  However, under unix shells (I don't know
about OS/2), the interrupt, quit, and suspend characters (usually ^C,
^\, and ^Z) are intercepted by the terminal driver before they reach
tf.  The terminal driver sends the corresponding signal (SIGINT,
SIGQUIT, or SIGTSTP) to tf.  Since tf never receives the keystroke, tf
can't do anything with it.

Under unix, you can use stty to change or disable those special keys
so they won't be intercepted by the terminal driver, and tf will
receive them.  But it will then become difficult to generate those
signals.  You could do:

  /def -b^C = /signal INT
  /def -b^\ = /signal QUIT
  /def -b^Z = /signal TSTP

But unlike the signals generated by the terminal driver, those signals
will be generated synchronously with other tf commands.  This means
when you type one of those characters, any macro that is currently
running must finish before tf will process the character.  This will
probably not be a problem for ^Z, but it makes ^C lose the ability to
interrupt an out-of-control macro.

I created a macro in the exact format as given in /help repeat so that one
of my robots would do something every five minutes.  But instead, when i
executed it, it went off, then 5 minutes later went off continuously less
than every second (not 5 minutes between them) till i hit ^C to stop it.

The version i'm using in this case is 35a13.

The macro given in /help repeat is:

/def doodle_forever = /doodle%; /repeat -0:30 1 /doodle_forever

Mine was:

/def unidle = emote picks up glasses and wipes down the table%; \
/repeat -0:05 1 /unidle

Why is it screwing up this way?

Ah the wonderous Sun uglyness.  You are in need of some patches or
an OS upgrade.  There should be something about it in the README
or on the website.

Just set up 3.5 alpha 21 (on Digital UNIX) and I've found a problem.
When holding down a left or right arrow key I get garbage characters
such as [D and [C.  This is made even more strange because if I hit
the same keys slowly they work fine.

I'm fairly certain this problem is new to this version.  Anyone else
run into anything similar?

Hello. I got a question, how difficult/feasible would it be to port TF to a
console based Win32 program? I am just learning Win32 programming, but am
totally unfamiliar with UNIX or OS/2 programming. Thanx.

I think this is new in this version, and it happens on SGI's running IRIX
5.3.

Call it a hunch, but I'd guess e means in TinyFugue.  That would account
for him sending it to the TinyFugue list.

Hello everybody,

I have been trying to use the /bind function in tf, but i've got a 
problem, how can i find out what codes certain keys have?

I want to use me numpad for walking (so that when i push 8 it sends n, 2 
will send s, etc.) And when it is possible it should make a difference if 
i have numlock on or off (numlock on -> walking, numlock off -> function 
keys) but i don't know what the key-codes are. (i'm working under linux)

I hope someone can help me with this...

goodbye, 
Lucas

Happens with FreeBSD 2.1.5-R as well. Appears to occur if there is a lot
of text coming in when you try to use the cursor keys.

	I came up with an idea and am trying to figure out how to implement it.
What i want to do is have a macro called /castgroup <spell> and have it cast
that spell on every member of the group, (the spell would actually be an alias 
to cast a spell..) I would like to do it pretty seemlessly (ie not see output 
of group command) Its pretty complex and im not really sure where to start, 
maybe pcmd.tf... Any idea/solutions would be apprectiated (sp?)

hiya, was just noticing today that in the version I use, 3.5a20 there's no
help for /loadworld anymore. Doesn't bother me cause I know how it works
but some newbie was confused. I know he's moved up to a new version, does
that still have help /loadworld or is he phasing the command out for
something else?

It was accidentally left out of the help.  The only difference between
/load and all those /load* commands is the default filename.  In fact,
the /load* commands are implemented as one-line macros that call /load.

I have verified this myself, please don't send any more reports.  It
seems to occur when tf reads multiple keystrokes at once; this could
happen for example when running tf remotely over a slow connection
(modem), or when tf is very busy doing other things.  I'll fix it
of course, but as always I can't say when.

There are better alternatives to holding arrow keys anyway.  To move
large distances, it's usually better to use the word movement commands
(^B and ^F by default, ^[b and ^[f if you /load kb-emacs.tf or
kb-bash.tf), go to the beginning of the line with ^A, etc.  Then you
know where the cursor will be without counting characters or waiting
for the screen to catch up.  See: /help keys.

HI..never did get an answer on the exact last step to save a mapped path 
to a <pathname.tf> file. I have a ton of them done..the format created 
uses /dopath, but like I said before, I have forgotten how the heck I did it!

Steps:
1. /mark  
2. /savepath <pathname>
3. /save -a <pathname> -i <pathname.tf>

My problem is in step 3. It used to produce a file named <pathname.tf> 
with a /dopath format. Can anyone remember how to do the last step right, 
or spot where I am making my mistake?


Talia

You may remember that, a couple of months ago, I posted something here
about a tf beginners' guide which I have written. Well, finally, I have
managed to get my computer connected to the Internet, and so I have put it
up for downloading at the URL
http://asm21.emma.cam.ac.uk/~asm21/mush/tf-beginners.html. Anyone wanting
a copy, help yourselves.

And while we're on this topic, did anyone actually get the copies I mailed
out? I haven't had /one/ reply yet ...

Enjoy!

Could you help me fix my macros?

I use the following to upload files into MOOmail:

/def p1 edup = /quote " '"%1//2-%2"

This loads in one line of text at a time (very time consuming).  How
should the macro read so that it reads the entire file as one line of text?

I use the following to upload files onto a screen in a room:

/def -p1 fedup = /quote -0 " '"%1"

This loads the file, but each line is read separately, with: You say:
"etc." preceding each line.  Same kind of problem.

I have the following macro:

/def -p1 fup = /quote '%1

But the moo doesn't read this at all...
Also... are any of my problems related to the fact that I am running a
very old version of tf (1.5 beta)? My sysad says he will be getting gcc up
soon... and we will get a newer version.

Thanks for your help.

Ok..I have suceeded in gagging the 'Activity' mssgs from background worlds,
but there doesn't seem to be a /def to gag % Trigger mssgs. I read the 
/def files, it lists possible things to gag, Trigger mssgs wasn't one of 
them. And the mssgs are scrolling the heck out of my foreground world. I am
using the most current version of tf (thanks to a kind member of this list),
and would appreciate any ideas on how to stop any mssgs of ANY kind 
coming from the background world.
Thanks :)

you can quiet triggers by using -q in the /def command.
If you don't want anything coming from a background world, why connect to
it at all?

 I am fighting aggro mobs for guild experience in one world, and editing 
in another. I have triggers set up to auto attack passing mobs, and to 
retrieve loot. I switch back and forth between worlds, but the mssg
% Trigger in world scrolls on the screen when I am in my editing world.
I tried using /def -q -t, it said -q not a valid option. I am now using 
the latest version, I believe.

I have a problem with tf. I use visual, but I don't want the prompt to 
from the mud to be shown in the input window (below the line). I tried 
doing /set lp 0, but it doesn't seem to help. A friend helped me code a 
work-around /def, but it only works if the prompt is a "> ". But 
sometimes when there's a lot of scroll and I'm lagged, part of the room 
desc or combat scroll appears in the input window, because tf thinks it's 
a prompt, because the newline hasn't arrived yet because of the lag. So 
what I'd like to do is disable this catch-prompt-and-put-it-in-input-
window function. I've looked through the help files, but I dunno, maybe 
I've missed something.

TIA.

just add  /def -ag -hBACKGROUND to turn off % Trigger in world message.
You can also add the line /def -ag -hACTIVITY to turn off % Activity msg.

You can also define the following lines in your .tfrc:

/def -i MAPFILE   = ~/tf-dir/pathfile.tf
/~def_file_command load map MAP
/~def_file_command save map MAP -i = /dopath *
/def -i listmap = /list -i = /dopath *

With these definitions you only have to write /savemap to save
your paths to a file (note however that it overwrites the file so
have all the paths loaded when you use this command) and /loadmap.

Recently a PBS petition has been posted on several mailing lists on 
tcp.com, sometimes several times.  This petition is a chain letter, and 
is not relevant to any list on this server.  As such, it is prohibited by 
list policies.

As a result several people have been barred from all lists for one 
month.  Any future postings of this petition will also result in the 
poster being barred for one month.  Feel free to bring this or any other 
inappropriate postings to my attention.

PS: Serena012 was also barred recently for forwarding inappropriate 
articles to the 90210 list.

Hi,

how do you obtain the return value of a command (e.g. in order to store
it in a variable)?

I checked the help text for "evaluation" but couldn't find anything.  I'm
sure it's dealt with somewhere else but I have no idea where to look...

thanks    Kai

Hi TF-User in the world!

One of the admins of 'my' MUD has written an char-orientated editor (not
the ugly ed) so that the progger can work as if they use 'joe' or a normal
Dos-edito. But this mode is only usable for telnet-user! I can't use it if 
TF is activ. Is there a way to configure TF so that it works as telnet - 
as long as I work with this MUD-editor? Only '/visual off' is not enough.

Greetings,

Hmm... Maybe try "/visual off%;/set emulation=raw" and then then set up
some "/bind" stuff to do "/send" of keys, so you don't get line oriented.
TF is line-oriented, so you would have to try and get around that, somehow.
Try it something like:
/bind ^Xa = /send -n a

And do that for all letters, replacing a with b, c, etc... and then you can
press ^Xa to send an a, plain, with no return after.

*shrug* I have no idea if this would work... try it... just an idea. :-)

I myself work a lot on line based 3270 telnet (IBM mainframe) and have 
figured out that it's quite possible to work with character based 
programs, as long as you keep a few things in mind. Every character on 
the line is sent as a character, so if you send a sequence of characters 
you send a sequence of single characters (sounds logical, doesn't it ;) 
This is so logical, that working from that you can perfectly figure out 
what to do with a character oriented editor (take for example, emacs. It 
has a function that reads a file, ^X^F filename). This can be perfectly 
done with a line oriented telnet, as follows: You type the line as being:
^X^Ffilename.c<enter>
This will invoke the load-file command in emacs, and send the filename 
after it and a return. This will perfectly load the file. Going 10 lines 
down can be done as follows: ^N^N^N^N^N^N^N^N^N^N
The only problem here is, is that the enter will be sent as an actual 
enter. This will create an empty line. To delete this, you have ti 
prepend ^K^K to your next command line.

Also, if you know how to navigate through certain programs, you can use 
the keycodes for that (eg: to quit 'pine' a mailreader, you send 'qyy')

This only works for things where you can either easilly void the 'extra' 
behaviour of the enter key, or you can rewrite a little of the tf-code to 
not let it send a CR when you hit enter, but make it so that you have to 
use a different key to send a literal enter.

Just my 2 cents (Hmm. I don't pay shit for my access, ah well :)
Mad.

I have /restrict world in my .tfrc, as I need that restriction for
multiple reasons. But, I ALSO need /quote access, and /log access. BUT, I
only want /quote to be able to read 1 filename, and /log to only allow a
certain number of bytes of data - say, 1Meg max at a time.  So how do I do
all of the above, and still have everything restricted of 'world'
restrictions?
Thanx,

This seems to work fine for me:
I want to replace Ayla by (C)Ayla:
/def -mregexp -p50 -F -t'^(.*)Ayla(.*)' sub_Ayla = /substitute %P1(C)Ayla%P2

Have fun :)

You could also try
   /def -mregexp -p50 -F -t'Ayla' sub_Ayla = /substitute %{PL}(C)Ayla%{PR}
which, rather than forcing the regular expression to match the whole line,
which is slow and inefficient (as I understand it :), uses special tf
substitutions to put in the text before (%{PL}) and after (%{PR}) the
regular expression which was matched. Basically, it's the same thing,
though.

I saw a message about this a few weeks ago, but I'd like to post anyway.  :)
My arrow keys are throwing characters up on the csreen instead of working 
correctly, when they are held down. (problem new to tf-35a21)
I am running on a Linux system, I believe, and the original post was 
answered with a post saying that the problem was unique to a particular 
setup, if I remember correctly.  Is there anything I can do to correst 
this, besides going back to 35a20?
Thanks,

I don't know about other people, but I have written a few source-level
hacks for tf, to do various things. However, I recently upgraded to the
Debian packaged version, and so of course lost all my modifications.

This, in itself, is not a problem; I can always put them back into this
version. The problem comes with some of the code which I've written in my
.tfrc etc, which uses some of the features I added, and which is now
broken. So, I thought to myself, `why don't I put in some mechanism to
allow the code to work out what was in the version it was running on, and
act accordingly?'

The sort of thing I have in mind goes something like:
  o  Somebody implements something groovy that requires a source-code
     modification.
  o  To the patch, they add a line which inserts something into one of the
     header files or source files, indicating the presence of this code.
     This is probably the trickiest bit. The easiest way seems to be to
     define a macro `ADD_FEATURE(name)', which adds it somehow to a global
     list, but this is probably hackish. However, getting patch to insert
     a line into a list sounds quite annoying too ... :(
  o  Any support code they write, or any code anyone else writes, can use
     the hasfeature(name) function to check if the named feature is
     present, and behave (eg not load) accordingly.

So, there are a few questions. One: is this a good idea, or should I just
be lobbying Hawkeye to get them included in the mainstream
distribution[1]? :)

Two: can anybody think of a better way of doing it?

Three: should I try for some way of allowing you to include version
numbers etc (featureversion(name))?

This is still very much speculative, but any comments would be
appreciated.

Cheers!

&E

[1] One of the reasons I haven't been doing this---which probably makes
quite a difference---is that a lot of them aren't actually quite right
yet!

Is there a way to disable or shut off the 'local echo' effect of typing a
command and then seeing it appear, as typed, on the screen? I've recently
switched to TF from a Win95 client, and have gotten used to being able to
disable this feature.

By this, I don't mean seeing the text come up as I type it, but, that it
stays after I hit 'enter' such as:

p Sue=:waves to you.
Long distance to Sue: Jane waves to you.

I prefer to just see the 'Long Distance to Sue: Jane waves to you.' stay on
my screen.

I tried looking through the help files, but didn't see anything that seemed
to apply.

I see you haven't entered the wonderful world of /visual. :-)

Try this '/visual on'

Thank you for all your responses on my 'local echo' problem. I wanted to
tell 'Myrddin', that I don't *LIKE* visual mode, it does weird things to my
screen and I get COMPLETELY 'lost' trying to multi-world, but, I suspect the
'/localecho off' suggestion from 'Qalar Tolandia' will work. :).

Anyone know why I'm getting 2 and 3 copies of the responses? Is it just
people sending multiple copies? Or, is it something else?

What this means is that you've got a 'sysadmin' that doesn't have a clue
how to admin a unix system.

What that 97% means is that 97% of the cpu's current work is going to
that process ... which only means that not much else is going on on that
system at the time. In other words, say you have a completely idle CPU.
You fire off a small script. Since the CPU isn't doing anything else, the
CPU will dedicate most of its resources to that script --- it does *NOT*
mean that that script is taking up 99% of the CPU's _potential_.

I think I'll at least have to partially disagree here. I've crashed my 
own (fairly slow) system more than once by defining regexp triggers and 
creating functions that just took 100% processortime. The rest of my 
processes completely hung up on me, because tf got stuck in the 
evaluation of a regexp.

You're right that 97% CPU-usage doesn't necessarilly mean that tf 
constantly uses that much of the actual CPU time, but you're wrong in 
saying that it's nothing to worry about. Tf is very able to completely 
hog a system if used 'correctly'.

Mad.

Hi Alice,
Well... you could try and check if you have any looping triggers or so.
These might make TF go wild. I don't know how you would disign such stuff
without you noticing somewhere else, though. It could also be that your
TF have been configured wrong for your system, in some strange way, or
simply that you have a serious system bug. There's nothing wrong with TF,
in itself. Try and run TF under a debugger, or trace it's system calls.
Maybe some system call is returning when it shouldn't? If you don't know
how to, ask your sysadmin to. :-)

(And now for some basic sysem architecture information...)

My dear Myrddin,
You couldn't be more wrong. If a process is taking 97% CPU on a UNIX
machine, it is simply using all the CPU it could possibly get. The last
few percent is probably the system itself that is using. Normally, my TFs
are using about 0.00% CPU on my FreeBSD system, running on a P75. Notice
that top itself, which displays these numbers actually took a LOT more.
In a UNIX enviroment, programs don't take all the CPU they get, unless
they are malfunctioning, or doing very heavy calculations, or so.
In DOS they do. There you just sit and wait, eating CPU, while waiting for
user input, or so. In UNIX you tell the system you want data and sit down
nicely and wait, giving CPU to other things. If there is no other program
to run, the CPU will sit and wait in the systems idleloop function.
Something is very wrong if TF is eating 99% CPU, because TF is very well
behaved and would do so only if:
1) There is something wrong with the system (could be)
2) Alice has configured some tiggers or hooks that are looking or otherwise
   not doing what was probably intended to.

Regards,
  Mikael

If the server supports the TELNET ECHO option, "/localecho off" will
disable tf's display of your input; but I don't think that's what you
want.  It sounds like what you really want is for your input to be
displayed as you type it, but then erased when you hit return.  There
is no way to do that.  If you want your input separated from output,
use visual mode.

Most of the time, tf should just be waiting for input from the user
or a server; while it waits, it gives up control of the cpu.  But
there are several ways tf could be made to do a lot of work during
those times it should normally be idle:

  Unwisely running nontrivial tf processes (/quote or /repeat) with
  -0 or %ptime=0.

  Unwisely running highly recursive or iterative macros, especially if
  %max_recur or %max_iter has been increased.

  An obscure bug in tf or your OS uncovered by using an unusual
  combination of input and time related features: /quote, /repeat,
  input from server, %refreshtime, %prompt_sec, %prompt_usec,
  %maildelay, %ptime.

Without more information about what you're doing, I can't tell you what
your problem is.  You can narrow it down by systematically avoiding
your normal operations: e.g., start with "tf -f <host> <port>" to skip
any possible problems related to your normal startup files, and see how
tf behaves then.

	You could bind ^j to collect the current input text, quote all
tf special characters in it, /eval that quoted line, and then do a
/dokey dline.  And start again.  Then again, I can't recommend visual
mode enough.

	Something like this, which works great except that you no longer
have input window history.

/def newline_no_display =\
    /eval $(/escape \% $[kbgoto(0),kbtail()])%;\
    /test kblen() & kbdel(kblen())
/def -b^j = /newline_no_display
/def -b^m = /newline_no_display

I play a Merc/Diku like mud, on telnet://walrus.com:3000, and I need to
spell me up every now and then, with a lot of armor spells. I want to
trigger this, because it's about 15 spells or so.

- Test 
I tried to test this stuff on 'heighten senses', a skill to see
hidden/invis/whatever. Of course, if the test works, I wanted to write
the rest of the script with all the spells.

If I type affect in the mud, I get a list of affecting spells/skills.
That list looks like this:

You are affected by:
Spell: 'heighten senses'  for 19 hours.



So that brought me to the following trigger:
/def -t`Spell: \'heighten senses\' *` = /set heightenSenses 1
This works fine :)



Now the spellup alias:
/def spellup = \
    ;; set flag to 0:
    /set heightenSenses 0 %; \

    ;; Turn to 1 if affected by heighten senses:
    affect%; \

    ;; If not affected by heighten
    /if (!heightenSenses) \

    ;; Then turn heighten on & unset the variable
        heighten%; \
        /unset heightenSenses%; \
    /endif

Somehow, this doesn't work, and the if always tries to turn heighten
senses on. That means the variable heightenSenses is always 0. 

I think it is because the if command doesn't wait for the output of the
'affect', and is executed before the heightenSenses variable has a
chance to become 1. Is there anyway to solve this problem ?

Hope someone has time to answer ;)
Duckie.

	That's correct.  tf has no way of knowing what to wait for, it
could be a single line, it could be 10 lines.  What if other lines
arrived while you were running the macro, but were unrelated to sending
'affect' (like other people doing things).

	The best thing would be if you get a string _after_ the spell
listing.  That is it looked like:

You are affected by:
Spell: 'heighten senses'  for 19 hours.
Spell: 'toaster repair' for 5 hours.
End of spells.

	You might even be able to fake the end of spells listing by
sending another command right after 'affect'.  Then what you do in your
spellup macro is clear the flags, send 'affect', let your detection
triggers work.  And then you have another trigger on 'End of spells.'
which then sends the commands to activate all of the appropriate
triggers.  If you have no nice way of generating the 'End of spells.'
kind of message, you could instead use /repeat to run the activation
macro after a certain delay (1-2 seconds probably).

Hidey-ho, I believe I'm the person she was speaking to, and I'm a
sysadmin as well, and I do know most of what I'm talking about. :)

TF isn't taking ~100% user time, it's making the system take close to
100% /system/ time (at least in my case).  This can be seen both from
XSysStats (1.34) and from top (3.3).  It seems to be OS-patchlevel
dependant, and I suspect TF was always doing this, but the system
CPU time never used to get lumped in with the process up until Data
General released 5.4R4.11MU02 (pant, pant).

The guilty function appears to be select() - whenever I have the
opportunity to do keyboard input, the CPU usage skyrockets.  I shell,
it drops (but then again, TF is probably not active then anyways).
I also can't CTRL-C - it simply prints the "C) continue tf; X)..." line,
and returns right to the system, but that's not related to the problem
as far as I can tell (I had the CPU problem crop up after I did an OS
upgrade, the CTRL-C happened after I went to 3.5a20).

Hope that helps,
 Jason

	Unapply the broken OS upgrade, since they obviously broke select
in the process.  It may also just be that they changed the statistic
mechanisms, and they are reporting all of the time that a program is in
select, even though the program is blocked.  In that case you aren't
really wasting cpu, but your statistic displays are incorrect.  Either
way, it's an OS big.

I just wanted to thank everyone for their advice and say... guess it
wasn't a tf bug.... turns out it was an old tf process left over from a
crashed session and it had been running since september sometime....
ooops, guess I run ps more often :)  (And get my sysad to be a little 
clearer about what's wrong :)

In C and C++ I can increment a variable like this
counter++

In tf I've been using 
/eval /set counter=$[counter + 1]

Is this even right?  Is there a shorthand?

	That's ok, as long as 'counter' is a global variable with /set,
and not a local variable.  You may find the folowing useful:

/def -i ++ = /test %{1} := %{1} + 1
/def -i +N = /test %{1} := %{1} + %{2}
/def -i -- = /test %{1} := %{1} - 1
/def -i -N = /test %{1} := %{1} - %{2}

	Use as expected:  /++ counter%;/-N mana 20%;/etc etc etc

	I forgot about tf's /list not quoting names starting with -
correctly.  You need an extra - in front of the second two to define
them:

/def -i ++ = /test %{1} := %{1} + 1
/def -i +N = /test %{1} := %{1} + %{2}
/def -i - -- = /test %{1} := %{1} - 1
/def -i - -N = /test %{1} := %{1} - %{2}

Erm, I have a tiny problem with my tinyfugue, in tt++ I could always
drag and drop multiple lines, while tf seems to put extra linefeeds in
it. So with tf every line is supposed to be a command. Any way to
prevend this ?

Assuming you want to do that inside a macro (not on the command line),
the /eval is not necessary; just use

  /set counter=$[counter + 1]

You could also use
 
  /test counter := counter + 1

There is no builtin shorthand like C's ++ operator, but you could write
a macro:

  /def inc = /test %1 := %1 + 1

and use it like this:

  /inc counter

    Someone said that tf has to check every line of output from the world
against every trigger loaded.  If there are a whole bunch of triggers
loaded, will it slow down tf significantly?  Is it a good idea to purge
triggers when I'm done with them?  What is the right way to go about this,
with /undef?  Will this free up memory or in any way make tf run
better/faster?  What about /set and /unset, does /unset free up memory or
otherwise help tf run better?

Thanks for all your helpful tips so far, I'd be quite lost without them.

	It is unlikely to slow down tf very much unless you are on a
slow machine to begin with.  You can also help by making using 'more
specific' triggers, like avoiding leading '*' with glob or using lots of
'.*' with regexps.  But again those shouldn't matter much unless it's
pretty slow.  If you really are done with the triggers you can use
/undef if they are named (naming triggers is always a smart idea).
/unset'ing a variable is unlikely to reduce the amount of memory being
used.  If you think you are using a lot of memory, you could lower the
amount of history (/help histsize).

	Now if you do have a lot of triggers, and do want them always
around, you can make things run a little faster by setting priorities on
them such that more common triggers have higher priority.  This way tf
shouldn't have to check quite as many triggers per line of mud text.

I had a similar problem when I used /watch. I had set watch on about 20 
of my friends and it started going really slow. When I removed them 
things ran faster again so I'd say, don't use too many triggers, 
especially if they are set to be activated on time.

	The problem with the watch command isn't the triggers, it's that
for each person you are watching, tf sends a 'WHO' to the mud every 60
seconds.  So you were averaging sending 'WHO' every 3 seconds and then
doing a wee bit of trigger matching on that.  /watch normally has 0
triggers installed.  When it's actively processing the WHO list, it'll
install 3 temporarily until the of the list.  So even with 20 of them
installed, at most you only have 3 extra triggers at any given time, and
usually no extra.

	For those inclined, /watch can be easily rewritten to only send
one WHO per minute no matter how many people you are waiting on, and
without using more triggers than a single /watch.

I am trying to make a trigger that quits me out when someone suddenly
attacks me, other than the mob i am currently battling.

Here is what i have:
/set playername=Phil
/set target=a harmless flea
/eval /def -1 -t'^(^%{target}) hit %{playername}' danger1 = quit
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^
I'm pretty sure that part is wrong.  I want this trigger to match
Bigbully hit Phil.
Backstabber hit Phil hard!!!
	but not
a harmless flea hit Phil.

phil

Yes, I think you're probably right. :) The '^' character can be used in
regular expressions either within square brackets, to provide negation, or
to mark the beginning of the line.

Instead, you can define a trigger with a higher priority, which does not
fall through (ie, don't use the -F switch to /def), and which matches just
your special case(s). Then your original trigger will not get to see `a
harmless flea hit phil.' This works fine in most cases, but if you're trying
to define a one-shot trigger, you may run into problems; probably the
easiest way is to name your override, and get the other trigger to remove
it, as follows:
      
	/eval /def -t'^%{target} hit %{playername}' danger1_ovr
	/eval /def -t'hit %{playername}' -1 danger1 = quit%%; /undef danger1_ovr

But note that, both in this case and with the one given above, you can't use
these in more than one world at a time, cos the triggers will replace each
other. However, you can use the ``special substitution'' ${world_name} to
name each trigger by the world you are CURRENTLY IN. But while we're at it,
if you are going to accept this restriction, we might as well use
${world_character} as well, to save you having to give your character name
seperately, as follows:

	/eval /def -t'^%{target} hit ${world_character}' \
		danger1_${world_name}_ovr
	/eval /def -t'hit ${world_character}' -1 danger1_${world_name} = \
		quit%%; /undef danger1_${world_name}_ovr
		
Obviously, since this is not the easiest thing to type in the middle of a
fight, you may prefer to define a macro to do this for you, but I'm sure you
can work that out for yourself! :)

So there you go. I hope this is (a) helpful, and (b) right ...

How about trying "/set wrap=off"? This will prevent TF from perturbing
the output from the MUD with linesfeeds. That way your terminal can do the
wrapping itself, and will allways wrap on the right column, and at the same
time, giving you cut'n'paste possibilities for lines longer then one
physical window line. This is true for example with xterm, where you can
normally cut'n'paste with lines longer then then width of the xterm, and
still have it treated as one line at paste time.
I hope that helps.

The Problem:
	I have a couple of gags (/def -ag) that I use to trap certain 
pieces of text to be logged, but not printed to the screen. The trouble 
is that these lines I'm gagging are followed by two blank lines (0x0A 
only). So the textual part is gagged ok, but I still get two blank lines 
dumped to my screen everytime, which kind of defeats the purpose of 
gagging (i.e. keeping my screen uncluttered).

What I've Tried:
	I've tried using \0x0a\0x0a at the end of the gag; doesn't seem 
to work.
	I've tried using a two shot gag that is triggered by the first 
gag, and gags blank lines:
	
/def -ag -t"* gossips *"=/def -ag -n2 -t"*[^a-z]*"
	
	Doesn't seem to work, the gags aren't implemented fast enough, 
and only one of them fires, leaving a spare lying around to be triggered 
by the naxt blank line (which may not be one I want gagged)


If anyone knows a solution to this problem, I would greatly appreciate it.

Actually, that glob isn't right (typo, I'm actually using "^[a-z]*" which 
doesn't quite do what I want either, but I stopped working on it when I 
saw that this method didn't work anyway). But either way, the problem 
isn't with the glob, but rather with the speed that the triggers are 
implemented. Most of the time, only one of them fires, leaving the other 
hanging around to trap some other blank line that's not intended to be 
gagged.

Ok.
I'm trying to find the EASIEST way to capture recall text to my editing
buffer, w/a mushcode conversion of the text processed.
E.g., if <player> paged me with something like 'Hi' and then, 'Where are
you?', it'd look something like:

Example pages "Hi"
Example pages "Where are you?"

Now, in my buffer I not only want that text in my buffer <yes I know of
FugueEdit & /redit <ref. from Amberyl's MushManuals>>, but I also want it
converted to mushcode - e.g., in my buffer I want to see:

Example pages"Hi"%RExample pages "Where are you?"%R

I currently have a working format of how to do this, a combination of a
def with Andrew Molitor's 'Mtrans' and 'FugueEdit', and here it is:

/def fe-recall = /repeat -01 1 &tf_tmp me=%;
/repeat -02 1 /log TF_TMP1%;
/repeat -03 1 /recall %0%;
/repeat -04 1 /log off%;
/repeat -08 1 /quote &tf_tmp me=!"mtrans < TF_TMP1"%;
/repeat -10 1 ed me/tf_tmp%;
/repeat -15 1 /sys rm TF_TMP1

I KNOW how inefficient this is...Is there a way to use TF macros or
something to convert a text to mushcode like Amolitor's Mtrans does?

And, can someone show some insight of other ways to do the task at hand
please?
Thanx,
Mike

How about adding a pre-defined variable in stdlib.tf, e.g.
  /set _has_feature_foobar=2
to indicate that this tf has version 2 of the "foobar" feature.

Several factors figure in the odds of my adding a feature:
  is it simple?
  is it useful in general, not just for some specific purpose?
  do I like it?
  do I have the time to implement it?

I never add a contributed patch directly; I always review it carefully
and at least modify it, possibly completely rewrite it.

How do you tell a /for loop to end, I mean like if I want a 
/for i n m command%; and then I want some other command to hapoen after
the for loop has run its course how do I do that, so far it seems that it
does everything I put after the %; as if it's in the for loop not outside
of it

Ok, never mind, got the for working in a $()
My new question is this, I have a 

$(for i 1 value /echo stuff) and somewhere in stuff is a $[rand(n)]

It gives me the same number each time. Is there a way I can tell it to
evaluate the rand for each loop, not just once for the whole for?

As far as I know, you can only gag on a line by line basis, and those =
blank
lines are separate lines.  I gag all blank lines, to keep my screen from
scrolling so much.  Here's the gag I use for blank lines:

/def -mregexp -ag -t'^$'

I also have gags, for blank prompt lines, etc...  makes for a much =
quieter
screen.

	Quote tf expands the $[rand(n)] before it even starts the $(),
so you want to delay that expansion by quoting the $[].  You also have
to quote the ()'s inside of the rand in this case, so that the close
parenthesis doesn't match the one for $().

/def foo = /echo $(/for i 1 10 /echo \$[rand\(100\)])

/foo --> 97 59 26 53 70 0 60 43 33 30

Or
/def bar = /echo $[rand(100)]
/def foo = /echo $(/for i 1 10 /bar)

/foo --> 78 68 33 57 4 22 16 16 40 9

A /for body is eval'd like any macro body.  On the command line (with
sub=off) you can't do multiple commands, so you can't do anything after
a /for either.  Inside a macro body a normal %; ends a /for just like
it ends any other command.  Since the body of the /for is a nested
eval, you need to use %% and $$ to get % and $ in the body.

/def foo = /for i 1 4 /echo # %%i%%; /echo $$[rand(100)]%; /echo done
/foo

produces:

# 1
21
# 2
95
# 3
19
# 4
73
done

this will work as long as it's always "x OBLITERATES y with z", otherwise
you'd have to make a macro to change a verb to past tense, and that could
get kind of ugly..

/def -mregexp -ag -t' OBLITERATES (.*) with' obliterate = /echo %p1 <----
OBLITERATED by %pl

the first one's a one, the second a letter L
this should work, I think.

Wouldn't setting up a two-shot trigger doing this, every time you hit
the first line you want gagged, work?

Here's what I'd like to do:

i) Work out a regexp that will match a string rather than words to result
in the same macro.

ii) Program a variable to check whether a certain skill is in operation
whenever I am in combat. The skill is started but takes a random few
rounds to complete. Rounds are denoted buy a line of asterisks.
	I'd like for the variable (slash) to be checked everytime combat
occurs. If the skill is not executing then the variable equals 0 and this
triggers the skill to start. If the skill is executing, the variable equals
1 and ignores any further attempts to trigger it.
	Interruption of the skill during combat or execution of the skill
automatically sets the variable back to 0 hence re-triggering the skill.

	I am just starting out on programming - would appreciate as
simple an answer to this problem or pointers to relevant resources. Or
even if it is possible.

Is there any way to configure Tinyfugue to exclude certain lines from 
logs, but not the screen?  I still want to see the messages as they 
appear, but I do not want them to appear in my log.  (or is this just 
part of editing logs and something that I will not be able to escape? ;)

Thanks!

Hi,

I wonder if it's possible to scroll text backwards instead of using recall

	You can make a fake world, turn on logging only for that fake
world.  Then trigger on all incoming lines and echo them into that fake
world depending on if you wanted them or not.  You'll probably want to
lower the histsize on your fake world, since you don't need it keeping
those lines around.

I know a few people on this list have been asking for something like this,
and I needed too the other day, so I have written it! This is basically a
cross between the tf /cat command and the mtrans command (except not so
flexible), to allow you to enter formatted text into tf and have it come up
correctly on a MUSH (and possibly other servers such as MOO/MUX/..., but I
have no experience with them).

It is not guaranteed to work in all cases, or to be 100% efficient
(improvements are welcome :), but it seems to work OK for me. Exact
instructions on using it are contained in the comments at the top of the
file. To use it, simply save the code below into a file (say tmcat.tf) in
your tf directory (usually your home directory). Then simply enter
	/load tmcat.tf
on the tf command line, and you're away!

Hope this is useful,

&E

I would like to use triggers that depends on screen output.

Scenario:
* MUD tells me I'm thirsty.
* Use trigger to notice that and automatically drink from container.
  BUT if the container is empty I'd like to get another from my pouch
      and drink from that instead.
-----

Do I have to use double triggers to notice that the container is empty or
can use "/if /then /else" and somehow and determine what my last
MUD-command returned?

I think it's not easy to solve that with an if/then, but it's easy to
just add an extra trigger, and have the original trigger work AGAIN,
suppose you have this trigger to drink:

/trig You are thirsty. = drink jug%;drink jug ... whatever

/trig It's already empty = get jug backpack%;/trigger You are thirsty.

Oh, erm, this doesn't work if you have 2 times drink jug in the first
trigger, coz you will get 2 jugs out da backpack...
So easiest:

/trig You are thirsty. = drink jug%;
/trig It's already empty = get jug backpack%;/trigger You are thirsty.

Well, play a lil with it and you will find something that works ;)
I don't think it's smart to trigger eating/drinking, btw, unless you are
never afk. If you are afk for 10 minutes you will be outta drink/food

Growl... now it is irritating me that I can't solve this...

What was the problem?
If the mud sends me a long line, longer than my screen width, it's being
wrapped. Ok so far. Now if I want to drag and drop such a wrapped line,
it's being cut at the place it was wrapped, and interpreted like 2
different lines, so I have to drag and drop all parts of the text
message seperated. I was able to drag 'n drop these multiple lines in
tintin++.

Ok, I tried /set wrap=off, /wrap off, tried to play with /wrapsize (TF
sets wrapsize to 79, while my color_xterm is 80), tried disabling
color_xterm's autowrap... But I still cannot drag and drop multiple
lines :(

It's not just that tf isn't compatible with my color_xterm (although I
have some problems with visual mode in color_xterm), in a normal xterm
it doesn't work the way I want it either (Visual works fine in normal
xterm)

Am I just stupid here or is this a common problem?
Can someone please help me with this? I'm afraid I'll end up in a
hospital otherwise :P

Thanks in advance,
Arjan Drieman

I am presently working on a version of TF for Win95/NT. It is going to be a
console, ie text mode, application so the look and feel should still be the
same as the unix version. I don't currently have a release date since I've
hit on a snag, but I will send updates here to the list as work progresses.

Ok, I can't seem to find an explanation for this in any of the help files.
Perhaps I'm not lookin in the right place...

In a def such as....

/def showdef = :quotes a macrop: $(/list %{1-@})

What exactly does the @ in the substition give us? This same construction
is used all over the place but as far as I can see it does
nothing....substitute in the first word of the argument given to /showdef
but if that doesn't exist use "@". Is it just a convinient failure mode?

How is the abouve any different then

/def showdef = :quotes a macro: $(/list %{1})

	Yes, that's exactly what it does.  If there is no arg, it
substitutes "@".  See '/help substitution', particularly the section,
'Variable and Argument substitution'.

> How is the abouve any different then
> 
> /def showdef = :quotes a macro: $(/list %{1})


	This will echo _every_ single macro you have, if you forget to
give it an arg.  Ie, the same thing that happens when you type '/list'
to tf.

I've heard there's a macro generally available called 'Fugue Edit' (or
something similar) that allows the TF user to 'grab' text from the screen
buffer into the command buffer to edit. (For example, to 'grab' the
description of a location to change it, or grab attributes set on an object
to change them)

If someone could email me (or post it to the list) with the macro, or the
location where I could find it, I need it for Tinymush usage (I was told
there are different versions based on where you're MU*ing).

Please note that I am VERY TF-programming ignorant, and need to be shown
the EXACT macro if possible, instead of being told to use XYZ function to
do ZYX action.

I appreciate this group's patience with me the rare times I make a post to
the list.

I have numerous triggers and macros.  I know that for every trigger,
they are compared against incomming text according to priority of the
trigger.  However I was wondering if I set the chance to 0 which
effectively turns off the trigger, does it still make the comparison?

Mainly I want to know this cause I have a lot of triggers that turn on
and turn off other triggers by using
/edit -c0 <trigger>  and  /edit -c100 <trigger>.

If it does the comparison reguardless of the chance setting I will have
to redo these triggers to define and undefine the respective triggers
rather than resetting the chance percentage.

Yes.  The comparison is always made, and attributes (hilites) are
applied (unless they are disabled); the <chance> is used only to
determine if the body should be executed.

Right.  It's probably best to write a macro to define your trigger:

  /def def_my_trigger = /def -t<trigger> my_trigger = ...

I recieved 3 replies to my request for the 'Fugue Edit' macro, one of which
actually was the macro. So, I'm set (for now). I just wanted to thank the
people who responded, and let everyone know that I don't need the
information anymore.

Thank you

In TF, do:

/def -p100 -ag -mglob -t'FugueEdit > *' = /grab %-2
/savedef

And make sure you /loaddef in your .tfrc


On the Tinymush, stick a command on yourself like so:

&C-ED me=$ed */*:@pemit %#=FugueEdit > &%1 %0=[switch(%1,
         name,[fullname(locate(%#,%0,*))],[get([locate(%#,%0,*)]/%1)])]

All in one line. Then you can do:

ed OBJECT/attribute to bring it into your edit window for changes.

ed OBJECT/name to edit the 'fullname' of an object..for an exit with 3 lines
 of aliases. :)

The locate is there so that the command can be on an object you own, if you
 don't want to put it on yourself. If you put it on an object, you might have
 to tinker with the object (or you) being set INHERIT.

-- ignore this if you're not a psychocoder
--
-- I have a version that puts @ or & as the first character, as appropriate, but
-- it uses a function attributes() that is softcoded that returns a list of
-- all attributes, and such. Feel free to email me if you're curious. :)
--
-- ignore that if you're not a psychocoder

Hopefully, that'll work fine for you. :)

Too bad it was not posted to the list.  I would like to check out this
Fugure Edit macro and finish out the thread.

It would have been, the first time around, if the list had the 'reply-to'
set to reply to the list, like I'm used to. :) It didn't, and I didn't get
back online till now. :)

If you're just looking for a program to edit attributes, you might want to
check out http://asm21.emma.cam.ac.uk/~asm21/mush/tf.html, and check out
eattr.tf.  It's a TinyFugue-only way of editing attributes.  Now, I've
only used it in TinyMUSH (and TinyMUX), but it seems to work fine.  The
only problem I've had with it is when I've tried editing attributes that
were edited by someone who isn't the owner (i.e. a wizard-set attribute).
Because those appear as &ATTR(number of owner), it bombs.

I believe the owner of the above mentioned page is a member of this
mailing list.  I wanted to take this opportunity to thank him for eattr
and other TF stuff he has on his page.  I use it.

Of course it does.  You are just assigning a probability for the execution
of the macro.  If you had to generate a random number before every single
attempt to match a pattern your tf would be creeping along like a snail :)

A macro that does a useful set of /undef s is the way to go.

Does such a definition need to be on a single line or can i still use the
\ for multiple lines?  In the past I had trouble doing this.

	You can use \ for multiple lines.  What you may have been having
trouble with is remembering to use %%; (and similar) as the seperator in
the inside macro:

/def macro_1 =\
    /def macro_2 =\
	/echo This is in macro_2%%;\
	/echo This uses an arg to macro_2: %%1%%;\
	/def macro_3 =\
	    /echo This is macro_3 and an arg to it: %%%*%%%;\
	    /echo Still in macro_3!%;\
    /echo We're now back in macro_1 because the last line ended \%;%;\
    /macro_2 Hi%;\
    /macro_3 ho Ho HO%;\
    /undef macro_2%;\
    /undef macro_3

You can use \.  Just be careful to escape or quote any metacharacters
in the original definition, since it is now nested inside another macro.
E.g., if your original definition was:

  /def my_trigger = /echo %1%; /echo %2

the defining-macro should be:

  /def def_my_trigger = /def my_trigger = /echo %%1%%; /echo %%2

Hi, Duckie,

Problem is that both define send-hooks and both act on a single 'n' by 
sending an 'n' too the MU* ...
The same is true for any single direction specifier, and if you use 
alias.tf and define alias with the name of just numbers, you have the 
same problem too.
Up to now I did not find a good work-around, I decided either to use 
speedwalk or to use map. Perhaps someone has a better idea?

Susan

Greetings -

I just ftp'ed and installed tf-35a21, and everything seems to be fine.
However, I'm working behind a firewall of the socks variety.  The socks
firewall is configured to use:

socks.proxy.domain.com  port 1080

If I set these options in tf for the proxy_host and proxy_port, the
connection closes almost immediately.

I know that tf will work with socks, since others have had it running
before, but I'm at a loss at this point to get it working.

Any ideas?  Please email me privately.

	Trying to get the latest alpha (35a21) compiled on a Sun3/50
running SunOS 4.1.1.  Craps out when doing the unix/symtest.c test
saying assembler had a problem trying to write symtest.o.  Checked
that I DID have cc, there was enough disk space, had permission, 
there was as assembler, etc.  I'm assuming this is a system problem,
so I'm hoping someone out there can give me the solution?  Thankx.

Hi..I have started to use a new server most of the time, and they have the
newer version of tf. Everytime I start it up, it spams me with a warning
for each world loaded that there is a password in a readable file. Can you
tell me either how I make the files unreadable (no, my sysadmin and
support people did NOT know ) or how to gag the messages when tf loads up?
Apart from not knowing much about their own system, the server is a good
one.
Thanks!

It would be too easy to comment about sysadmins who don't even know that

To use SOCKS, set SOCKS='yes' in the unix/Config file before installing, as
described in unix/README.  Don't set %proxy_host or %proxy_port.

Howdy folks,

I'm trying to write a simple bit of code that will simply increment a
set variable at certain times.  I know this has been discussed here
before, but dumb me can't remember anything.  Can anyone give me a
hint?  :)  Thanks.

I had a bit of  trouble when I first installed TF on my Linux machine. 
The problem turned out to be that I had failed to install some critical 
packages under Linux. Check which packages you have installed. :)

it's on $guest. I don't think it's a tf problem though, but with the verbs
on your MOO that are looking for it.

Hey all,
	Trying to make one of my macros wait like 5 seconds before going 
on to the next command.  I know this can be done with /repeat, but I'm 
trying to come up with an easier and less complex ie:

/def blah=Turn around%;/pause 5%;Turn back around%;/pause 2%;/echo Done.

Ideas/Suggestions?


Thanks, Gart

It is possible to write a /pause that suspends the entire tf process,
but not one that suspends only the calling macro.  This violates the
usual nonblocking nature of tf, but if you don't mind blocking the
entire tf session, you can use this (assuming a unix shell):

    /def pause = /quote -S -decho !sleep %*

Note that if you do anything before the /pause (even /echo), it will execute
before the /pause, but you will not see the results until after the /pause.

Ok, I couldn't scroll back to get the tf notification of what it was
doing, but basically:

I did an /addworld tel hst-b46.resnet.emory.edu

I then opened the world, and as it started to load up, tf told me
something to the effect of:

"This looks like a telnet world."
"I am redefining it as such, but you should explicitly use /addworld -T."

I then did a /saveworld ~/.tf.worlds, and then did a /listworlds to see
what it had done.

It basically trashed everything from that last entry on to the end of the
file. I would cut and paste it, but it has a bunch of control characters,
and I doubt anyone would appreciate seeing them in their email.

Okay, that's it.

I am attempting to use a comm. program called terminate4.0
to log into my UNIX shell account. All works well except
when I try to use tinyfugue with it. Terminate puts all
the output from the MUSH into the input window of tinyfugue.
I can turn visual off but I like having the seperate windows.
Any one have any ideas why terminate is doing this and what
I could do to stop it. TF works ok with the other comm. program
I have but I would like to use terminate since it is more configuarable.

Thanks,
Theron

Sounds like something is miscounting lines. Standard things to do with
 ANY terminal program:

 - make sure your terminal emulation matches what the shell that is running
   tinyfugue has as a TERM setting

 - make sure the columns and lines match too. :)

 - shut off 'command lines' and 'menu lines' and such that stay on the screen
   at all times

Thing is, with some terminal programs, their emulations of VT100 aren't quite
 standard, and so they don't produce 'expected' responses. I don't know of any
 programs that TEST this sorta thing...would be sorta tough to do.

Well, no you didn't. :) That would return 
	addworld: wrong number of arguments

So lets guess you did it with a port of 23 :)

Okay, yup, I got this.:)

Did you /dc first from the world?

I didn't. I just waited for it to time out. And you didn't need to do a 
/saveworld to do a /listworlds, but okay. :) I did that. :)

Now, lessee, I got the same sorta reaction here (linux 1.2.6 kernel):

The last entry in the worldsfile is  now:

	/addworld -T"telnet" tel *^C *^C  k^E  k^E *^C

Where the * are a little block centered in the character space. I'm not
 sure what ascii value that is. Here's a 'hexdump -cx' of it, starting at
 the first d in /addworld.

No, I was just simply sitting in the world and saved the changes to the

Hmm, intresting.  I use terminate 4.0 sometimes and I've never seen that.
Check all the configurations and what not.  What type of emulation is it
using?  You can set that in the dialer window.

I'm still trying to isolate it, but I'm having a little bit of problem in
  some places, with the combination of TinyMush Whitewolf 2.2.2 and tf 3.5b1.

Seems that I can't connect to a character with a semicolon in its password on
  entry to a /world...but I can connect if I type out the 'connect' line by
  hand after the failure. 

Like I said, I'm still trying to see where the problem might be, but was
  wondering if anyone found anything similar, or has been poking around in the
  source and has seen anything that might produce this sort of behaviour?

This has been fixed for the next release, but you can avoid the problem
by using the appropriate -T option in your initial definition, instead
of doing (or letting tf do) a later redefinition.

BTW, it probably only trashed that one /addworld command; if there
were supposed to be other /addworlds after that one, they're probably
not lost, they're just after all that garbage.

I've been trying to add a partial hilite to a line of text generated by a 
macro. The problem I'm having is that it doesn't seem possible partially 
hilite an '/echo', so I'm considering other options. 

Questions:
	1. Did I miss something? Has anyone else been able to add a partial 
to an /echo command?
	2. Is there an easy way to send the ANSI control characters 
manually? If so, I'll write a .tf file that'll do it.
	3. Are there plans to add this functionality to the echo function 
(-peer hawkeye-)?

	Thanks in advance for any help.

you can /echo something and have a trigger partially highlight it.

yes. but you need to /set emulation raw first, but that turns off your word

Ok, what I'm trying to do is to create a macro to send multiple commands
without the linefeed till the command is complete.

For instance, if I want to drag 5 barrels from one room to the next
the commandline for this in the mud is:

drag barrel drag 2.barrel drag 3.barrel drag 4.barrel drag 5.barrel e

where the last element of the command line is the direction to drag.

I'd like to make a macro to do this:
/drag 5 barrel e
where:
  %1 = number of items
  %2 = item
  %3 = direction

However I can't see how to stop it from sending the carriage return.

For instance I had something like:

/def drag = \
    /let DIR=%{3}%; \
    /let ITEM=%{2}%; \
    /let COUNT=%{1}%; \
    /let INDEX=1%; \
    drag %{ITEM}%; \
    /while (%{INDEX} <= %{COUNT}) \
        drag %{INDEX}.%{ITEM} %;  \
        %{INDEX}$[%{INDEX} + 1]%; \
    /endwhile%; \
    %{DIR}%;


not sure if the syntax is correct but something to this effect is what
I'm trying to accomplish, however, this would send each line separately
and I want it to send them all at the same time to create the line:

drag barrel drag 2.barrel drag 3.barrel drag 4.barrel drag 5.barrel e
etc..

Any ideas?

	Collect the command into a string, and then send the whole
string at one time.

Maybe some evals are needed here and there. There is a lot of time I 
don't TF... The idea is concatenating the whole command in a string.

Ok.. maybe I'm a gimp, but could someone give me an example of a trigger 
that works off of an /echo?

I was under the impression that triggers only listened to the incoming 
text from the MU*.

Thanks in advance.

Your impression is right, that can't be done.

Hi! (yes, I'm new to the list :) )
I'm using tf as an eggdrop client, and it works just fine. 
2 Things would be cool if anyone could give me a hand with.
* I'd like to use swedish letters (which isn't supported on this stupid
terminal so I can't show you). I've heard that there might be a patch for
this, I found something that might have been the right one, but the
patching failed. Wrong version I guess...
* I'd really like a way of changing the command char "/" in tf, either at
compile time, or interactivly with a variable. Why? Cause the slash is the
command char in ircii and I'd like to use it that way, and I don't want
tf to tell me: % whois: no such command or macro. 
That's all folks..

Don't know about swedish letters.. sorry. ;)

I'd suggest something like:
/def whois = %/whois %{*}

The '%' escapes out the slash, sending it intact to the irc session.
The '%{*} passes whatever arguments you enter along to the irc command.
While it's a pain to define one of these for each irc command, the 
benefit is that you can name them whatever you want. eg:

/def wi = %/whois %{*}

It's a workaround, but at least you won't have to recompile anything. :)

There's an easy way around it...if you want to use a tf command, use
/tfcommand like normal. Want to do something irc? Type //irccommand. Two
/'s at the beginning makes it just send a slash to the system you're
connected to.

Like the header says, let me know if this gets annoying, but I'm 
determined to find a way to partially hilite an echo, whether it's 
seemingly possible or not. ;)

Ok, is there a way to send an echo somewhere other than a world? Like, 
fooling tf so that what it thinks is a world is actually a file? I'm 
thinking that if that's the case, I could play around with quoter.tf or 
something of the like to produce the desired effect, assuming the ANSI 
stayed intact.

Another option would be to figure out a way to have an echo not 
necessarily contain a newline at its end, so that you could effectively 
append one echo after the other on the same line, and build your 
uber-echo that way.

The final option would be to set the term to raw, and have something that 
reformatted everything, but frankly, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I 
like my visual just the way it is, and I don't revel in the idea of 
trying to recreate it. :)

Thoughts, comments, equally impossible problems welcome.

						-Matt.

PS. If you're going to send mail to tell me to quiet down, I suggest you 
don't post it to the list. :)

Hmmm... yeah.. that might just cut it. It will be a whole lot of /defs

Yeah, I'm confused, too.  I was under the distinct impression that tf did not
work with IRC.  It would be cool if it did, but that would be asking alot of
Hawkeye.

howdy,
Can anyone tell we why i get the following error messages in tf when i run the 
macro /init manualy inside tf ? 

---[cut]--- 
% macro not defined: '
% def: unmatched ' in t option 
---[cut]---

The macro "init" is defined as follows:
/def init = \
   /def -mregexp -t'Spell: (.*) modifies .* hours\.$' spellcheck = \
      /echo Spellcheck-trigger

While i was writing this message i asked me the question if it's possible
to define a macro inside a macro ???

Hi out there,

I have a problem with my input history. Like told in the manual
I have set up a logfile for the input history via:
  ;;; log input history
  /eval /sh mv %HOME/.tf.input.history %HOME/.tf.input.history.read
  /eval /quote -0 -dexec /recordline -i '%HOME/.tf.input.history.read
  /eval /log -i %HOME/.tf.input.history

This works pretty well, at least until there are commands starting with
-w for example, which were interpreted as world argument for the /quote
command. In the mud I am working for the -w is a often used command for
channels so many errors occure.
I already tried to somehow escape those lines while quoting/reading them
but I don't succeed at all.
Anyone out there having an idea what to do?

CU,
  Tolpan

Ok, I'm getting close but it's not working.

I am trying to make a macro to drag multiple items from one room to
another.

To drag 4 barrels west one room the command line would be:

drag barrel drag 2.barrel drag 3.barrel drag 4.barrel w

or:

drag 1.barrel drag 2.barrel.... etc

I've tried the for loop and a while loop to concatenate the string into
one command but neither seem to work. The for loop is way off base and
the while loop is close but only does it once. *Boggle*

BTW, thanks for the suggestions on concatenating the string. I whapped
myself on the head for not thinking of it myself.

Here's what I have, yet it has some problems and I cant figure out what
is wrong with it:

/def drag = \
    /set DIR=%{3}%;  \
    /set ITM=%{2}%;  \
    /set CNT=%{1}%;  \
    /set INDEX=2%;   \
    /set DRAG=drag%; \
    /set DRAG=$[strcat(%{DRAG}, " ", %{ITM})]%; \
    /while ($[%{INDEX} <= %{CNT}]) \
       /set DRAG=$[strcat(%{DRAG}, " drag ", %{INDEX}, ".", %{ITM})]%; \
       /set INDEX=$[INDEX + {1}]%; \
    /done%; \
    /set DRAG=$[strcat(%{DRAG}, " ", %{DIR})]%; \
    /send %{DRAG}

what it is doing is completing the while loop one time and incrementing
INDEX too much.

When I check the variable to see what I have I get (trying to drag 7
barrels):
/drag 7 barrel w

% DRAG=drag barrel drag 2.barrel w
% INDEX=9

go figure...

I've also tried the same thing with a for loop:

/def drag = \
        /let DIR=%{3}%; \
        /let ITM=%{2}%; \
(this next line all on one line)
        /for INDEX 1 %{1} /set DRAG=$[strcat(%{DRAG}, " drag ",
                           %{INDEX}, ".", %{ITM})]%; \
        /set DRAG=$[strcat(%{DRAG}, " ", %{DIR})]%; \
        /send %{DRAG}

but this doesn't do anything near what I expect... when I do:
/drag 7 barrel w
I get:

% DRAG=drag .barrel w
or something very close to that... it ignores the variable and does it
only one time.
wierd.
Am I missing something obvious?

    /eval /quote -0 -dexec /recordline -i - '%HOME/.tf.input.history.read

The lone '-' marks the end of options, so /recordline will not
interpret the following text as an option even if it starts with '-'.
See /help options.

I don't know anything about swedish characters, but TF does support the
standard LANG environment variable.  If your OS and hardware support the
swedish locale, and you set LANG appropriately, swedish characters
should work in TF.  See: /help locale.

Type "//whois" to send "/whois" to the server.  Lines beginning with
more than one "/" have the first removed and are sent.  See: /help interface.

Someone else suggested "/def whois = %/whois %{*}".  This is wrong;
"%" does not escape "/".  But you could define "/def whois = //whois %{*}"
if you find typing the double "/" too annoying.

If the server accepts a leading space, this can be handled by the loop.
The $[strcat...] is okay, but simple expansion is easier.
>     /while ($[%{INDEX} <= %{CNT}]) \
Don't use $[...] inside /while(...).
Don't use %{...} inside expressions (they work, but it's easier not to).
>        /set DRAG=$[strcat(%{DRAG}, " drag ", %{INDEX}, ".", %{ITM})]%; \
Again, the $[strcat...] is okay, but simple expansion is easier.
>        /set INDEX=$[INDEX + {1}]%; \
You want the number 1, not the first argument {1}.
>     /done%; \
>     /set DRAG=$[strcat(%{DRAG}, " ", %{DIR})]%; \
Again, the $[strcat...] is okay, but simple expansion is easier.

/def drag = \
    /let DIR=%{3}%;\
    /let ITEM=%{2}%;\
    /let CNT=%{1}%;\
    /let INDEX=1%;\
    /let DRAG=drag %{INDEX}.%{ITEM}%;\
    /while (INDEX <= CNT) \
       /let DRAG=%{DRAG} drag %{INDEX}.%{ITEM}%;\
       /let INDEX=$[INDEX + 1]%;\
    /done%;\
    /send - %{DRAG} %{DIR}

See the /help topics:  expansion, expressions, /while.

Yes, but your problem is that the "$" is interpreted by /init as the
beginning of a macro substitution "$'".  Escape it by using "$$'.
See /help substitution.

Well, this message serves two puproses.

1> Find out if something is possible.
	I want to make a second status line, like /visual, which will be 
more accurate in telling me about active worlds and such. I have this 
pretty wellplanned out, so could somebody tell me if any part of this is 
not possible?

I want the status line to be one of three places, whichever works 
easiest. Top of the screen, just above the /visual line, just below the 
/visual line. I figure the last would be hardest, so least likely tho 
that would be an ideal place for it.

I want the names of the connected worlds to be spread out evenly on the 
status line. The names will obviously have to truncate if they get to 
long and there would have to be a minimum of one space between the worlds.

I also want it to be in color. Background worlds on dull white, forground 
world bold. Activity within the past 5 (variable?) minutes and the world 
name will be in green, activity older then that it will be red.

I know, I don't want much. :) But I have a million things to do lately 
and I just wanted to swamp myself furthur. ANyway, if this can't be done, 
let me know. Or more precisely, you can skip me and send the suggestion 
directly to Mr. Keys. :)

2> If this all is possible, someone want to point me in the right 
direction on *how*? :)

		Patrick, who has never tried a big project in TF before 
			 and thinks it's about time to try.

ps: Course, if something like this is already done, not counting /visual, 
point me to it?

Hmmm... there is a way of using tf on irc, and a pretty cool way too.
This way (my way), tf doesn't handle the connection with the irc server,
only a connection with an irc client. The best client for doing this, of
course, is an eggdrop. I can hear some of u screaming... a BOT? U want us
to use a freaking bot? And I just go... "Eeehh.. yep". 
What is a difference between a bot and a ordinary client then?
Hmmm... none, I'd say. A bot is an automatic client, but the way I use my
eggdrop is not automatic at all. So in this case, the eggdrop is a client.
The cute thing about the eggdrop is that it handles both dcc connections
and telnet connections (even multiple connections, say.. 200 of them :) )
Hmmm... other than that, check out the eggdrop page... whereever that
is...

Line I want to trigger on:

There are 2 herbs in the pouch.

Output I need:

party say 2 herbs

(The only thing that changes is the number.)

Line I want to trigger on:

Genesis Is in village church <d e w n s>.

Output I need:

party say Genesis Is in village church <d e w n s>.

(The only thing that stays the same is: Is in)

If anyone can help, I'd be happy... If anyone has sample triggers or
complex .tfrc's that they could send me I'd also be happy.

if 'herbs' stays the same, try this:

/def -mglob -t'There are {*} herbs in the pouch.' herbs = party say %3 herbs

probably nothing you can use... I like to highlight some events in colors
with things like /def -i -ahCgreen -hworld though...

I need to trigger on this line:

** HP: 155/206   SP: 100/206

If the HP value (155) drops below 155, I need to execute macro <heal>
If the SP value (100) drops below 100, I need to execute macro <mana>

I would also like the line I triggered on to turn red if either of the 2
happen.

If anyone know how to do this I would be happy.

I received the following message from the system administrator on my 
local provider. I can answer the first question, can someone help me 
with good answers to the other questions?

I've noticed that a number of you have built and are running a
package named 'tf'.  What is it?  Why does it suck so much CPU time?
Since so many of you have built it in your home dirs, should we
save some disk space & install it system-wide?

Hi All,

I used to be subscribed to this mailing list and someone pointed me to a
patch for Linux so my 8bit chars would work correctly. This was months
ago, but I've installed linux on a new machine and I seem to need the
patch again. If anyone knows the address, I'd appreciate it (please send
it via personal email!) 

ta muchly
Alexis

Hey folx! Just writting to update the list on my progress with a Win32, ie
95/NT, version of TF. I just changed from trying to use MS VC++ to using
Cygnus' Win32 version of GCC. So far it looks alot more promising that
VC++. I was able to compile all but 2 source files without any
modifications at all, so I should have something compilable soon.

Talk to ya all later!

Thanks Jason, 

I am also working with the Cygnus GCC, so far I haven't had much luck
though, I am still getting problems with lots of unreferenced errors.

I've gotten all but two source files to compile without getting any errors
or warnings... I haven't had a chance to dive into the teo sources yet,
but I am going to check my config.h file first to make sure that isn't
causing the problem first.

Yep, I know this and I had it all working nicely on my old machine -- but
apparently on Linux a patch is required to get locales working properly.
Someone was nice enough to refresh my memory on the location :)

thanks

TF has had working locale support since 3.5 alpha 19 (5/27/96); it was
first added in 3.5 alpha 16 (3/10/96), but it had a few bugs then.  So,
if your system supports 8-bit locales, tf will too if you set the LANG
envrionment variable correctly.  See /help locale.
